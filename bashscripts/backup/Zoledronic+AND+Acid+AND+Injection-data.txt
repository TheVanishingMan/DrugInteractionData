        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In-vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to 77%. In-vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In-vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. ( 7.1 ) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with Zoledronic Acid Injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. ( 7.2 ) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in Zoledronic Acid Injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is needed when co-administered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 15 minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1-14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15-28). Co-administration of thalidomide with Zoledronic Acid Injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pharmaceutics International, Incorporated (Pii) at 410-584-0001 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of Zoledronic Acid Injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33-84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Dosage and Administration (2)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia and dyspnea. (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg or Pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: Asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of Zoledronic Acid Injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24-48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2,042 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors. Table 6 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the Pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg /dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9). Table 9: Percentage of Patients with Treatment Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zoledronic Acid Injection to 15 minutes. Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Pamidronate 90 mg n/N (%) n/N % Normal 27/246 (11%) 23/246 (9%) Abnormal 2/26 (8%) 2/22 (9%) Total 29/272 (11%) 25/268 (9%) Solid Tumors Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 17/154 (11%) 10/143 (7%) Abnormal 1/11 (9%) 1/20 (5%) Total 18/165 (11%) 11/163 (7%) Prostate Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 12/82 (15%) 8/68 (12%) Abnormal 4/10 (40%) 2/10 (20%) Total 16/92 (17%) 10/78 (13%) The risk of deterioration in renal function appeared to be related to time on study, whether patients were receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection (4 mg over 15 minutes), placebo, or pamidronate. In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial Zoledronic Acid Injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Acute Phase Reaction- Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5 )]. Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema, and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction /shock have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive re-challenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R). ( 5.1 ) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. ( 5.2 ) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. ( 5.3 ) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zoledronic Acid Injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. ( 5.4 ) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zoledronic Acid Injection if severe symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Zoledronic Acid Injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. ( 5.9 , 8.1 ) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic Acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R) or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zoledronic Acid Injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zoledronic Acid Injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic Acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zoledronic Acid Injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Zoledronic Acid Injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Zoledronic Acid Injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of Zoledronic Acid Injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use Zoledronic Acid Injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as Zoledronic Acid Injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic Acid Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and post-implantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 15 - minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Coadministration of thalidomide with zoledronic acid injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-866-901-DRUG (3784) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of zoledronic acid injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 4). Table 4 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with zoledronic acid injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of zoledronic acid injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 5 and 6.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including zoledronic acid injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis, or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors. Table 7 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving zoledronic acid injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 10). Table 10: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of zoledronic acid injection to 15 minutes.

In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial zoledronic acid injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of zoledronic acid injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw but also of other anatomical sites including hip, femur and external auditory canal) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when zoledronic acid injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema, and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS : taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses : blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal : dry mouth; Skin : Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal : muscle cramps; Cardiovascular : hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal : hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site : weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities : hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany, and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast(R). (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting zoledronic acid injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9,8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating zoledronic acid injection Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R)(zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with zoledronic acid injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with zoledronic acid injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of zoledronic acid injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with zoledronic acid injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 µmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 µmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of zoledronic acid injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of zoledronic acid injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use zoledronic acid injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when zoledronic acid injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In-vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to 77%. In-vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In-vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with zoledronic acid injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is needed when co-administered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 15 minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Coadministration of thalidomide with zoledronic acid injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events ( greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or www.amneal.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of zoledronic acid injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings And Precautions (5) and Dosage And Administration (2) ]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg or Pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: Asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with zoledronic acid injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of zoledronic acid injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including zoledronic acid injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2,042 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4 months for other solid tumors. Table 6 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving zoledronic acid injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9). Table 9: Percentage of Patients with Treatment Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Pamidronate 90 mg n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 27/246 (11%) 23/246 (9%) Abnormal 2/26 (8%) 2/22 (9%) Total 29/272 (11%) 25/268 (9%) Solid Tumors Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 17/154 (11%) 10/143 (7%) Abnormal 1/11 (9%) 1/20 (5%) Total 18/165 (11%) 11/163 (7%) Prostate Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 12/82 (15%) 8/68 (12%) Abnormal 4/10 (40%) 2/10 (20%) Total 16/92 (17%) 10/78 (13%) *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of zoledronic acid injection to 15 minutes. The risk of deterioration in renal function appeared to be related to time on study, whether patients were receiving zoledronic acid injection (4 mg over 15 minutes), placebo, or pamidronate. In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial zoledronic acid injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of zoledronic acid injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings And Precautions (5) ]. Acute Phase Reaction- Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings And Precautions (5 )]. Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema, and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS : taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses : blurred vision; Gastrointestinal : dry mouth; Skin : Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal : muscle cramps; Cardiovascular : hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive re-challenge; Renal : hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site : weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities : hyperkalemia, hypernatremia."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg per 5 mL (concentrate for intravenous infusion) should not be treated with zoledronic acid injection 5 mg per 100 mL (solution for intravenous infusion) (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting zoledronic acid injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, muscle pain may occur. Discontinue zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur (5.5) Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid injection 4 mg per 5 mL (concentrate for intravenous infusion) contains the same active ingredient as found in zoledronic acid injection 5 mg per 100 mL (solution for intravenous infusion). Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg per 5 mL (concentrate for intravenous infusion) should not be treated with zoledronic acid injection 5 mg per 100 mL (solution for intravenous infusion) or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with zoledronic acid injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with zoledronic acid injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of zoledronic acid injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with zoledronic acid injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.6 Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of zoledronic acid injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of zoledronic acid injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use zoledronic acid injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid injection are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and post-implantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Aminoglycosides: May lower serum calcium for prolonged periods (7.1) Loop diuretics: May increase risk of hypocalcemia(7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution(7.3) Drugs primarily excreted by the kidney: Exposure may be increased with renal impairment. Monitor serum creatinine in patients at risk (7.4) No in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed for zoledronic acid injection. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood. In vitro mean zoledronic acid protein binding in human plasma ranged from 28% at 200 ng/mL to 53% at 50 ng/mL. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 7.4 Drugs Primarily Excreted by the Kidney Renal impairment has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or other risk factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In patients with renal impairment, the exposure to concomitant medications that are primarily renally excreted (e.g., digoxin) may increase. Consider monitoring serum creatinine in patients at risk for renal impairment who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) were pyrexia, myalgia, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity (6.1). Other important adverse reactions were flu-like illness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (6.2),and eye inflammation (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-866-901-DRUG (3784) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Paget's Disease of Bone In the Paget's disease trials, two 6-month, double-blind, comparative, multinational studies of 349 men and women aged greater than 30 years with moderate to severe disease and with confirmed Paget's disease of bone, 177 patients were exposed to zoledronic acid injection and 172 patients exposed to risedronate. Zoledronic acid injection was administered once as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes. Risedronate was given as an oral daily dose of 30 mg for 2 months. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5.1% in the zoledronic acid injection group and 6.4% in the risedronate group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 1.7% and 1.2% for the zoledronic acid injection and risedronate groups, respectively. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of the Paget's patients receiving zoledronic acid injection (single 5 mg intravenous infusion) or risedronate (30 mg oral daily dose for 2 months) over a 6-month study period are listed by system organ class in Table 4.

Approximately 21% of patients had serum calcium levels less than 8.4 mg/dL 9 to 11 days following zoledronic acid injection administration. Renal Impairment In clinical trials in Paget's disease there were no cases of renal deterioration following a single 5 mg 15-minute infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Acute Phase Reaction The signs and symptoms of acute phase reaction (influenza-like illness, pyrexia, myalgia, arthralgia, and bone pain) were reported in 25% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection-treated group compared to 8% in the risedronate-treated group. Symptoms usually occur within the first 3 days following zoledronic acid injection administration. The majority of these symptoms resolved within 4 days of onset. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported with zoledronic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of zoledronic acid injection: Acute Phase Reactions Fever, headache, flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgia, and myalgia. Symptoms may be significant and lead to dehydration. Acute Renal Failure Acute renal failure requiring hospitalization and/or dialysis or with a fatal outcome have been rarely reported. Increased serum creatinine was reported in patients with 1) underlying renal disease, 2) dehydration secondary to fever, sepsis, gastrointestinal losses, or diuretic therapy, or 3) other risk factors such as advanced age, or concomitant nephrotoxic drugs in the post-infusion period. Transient rise in serum creatinine can be correctable with intravenous fluids. Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions with intravenous zoledronic acid including anaphylactic reaction/shock, urticaria, angioedema, Stevens- Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and bronchoconstriction have been reported. Asthma Exacerbations Asthma exacerbations have been reported. Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of the following events have been reported: conjunctivitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, uveitis, episcleritis, scleritis and orbital inflammation/edema. Other Hypotension in patients with underlying risk factors has been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Products Containing Same Active Ingredient: Patients receiving Zometa should not receive zoledronic acid injection(5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Patients must be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D(5.2) Renal Impairment: A single dose should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes. Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with underlying renal impairment or with other risk factors, including advanced age or dehydration.Monitor creatinine clearance before each dose (2.7,5.3) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) has been reported. All patients should have a routine oral exam by the prescriber prior to treatment (5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture (5.5). Pregnancy: Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised (5.6, 8.1) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Withhold future doses of zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur (5.7) 5.1 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient Zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient found in Zometa, used for oncology indications, and a patient being treated with Zometa should not be treated with zoledronic acid injection. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Pre-existing hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g., hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery; malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine) must be effectively treated before initiating therapy with zoledronic acid injection. Clinical monitoring of calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) is highly recommended for these patients [see Contraindications (4)]. Hypocalcemia following zoledronic acid injection administration is a significant risk in Paget's disease. All patients should be instructed about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in maintaining serum calcium levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Information for Patients (17)]. 5.3 Renal Impairment A single dose of zoledronic acid injection should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes.[see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Zoledronic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min and in those with evidence of acute renal impairment. [see Contraindications (4)]. If history or physical signs suggest dehydration, zoledronic acid injection therapy should be withheld until normovolemic status has been achieved. [See Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)] Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal impairment. Acute renal impairment, including renal failure, has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise, advanced age, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, concomitant diuretic therapy, or severe dehydration occurring before or after zoledronic acid injection administration. Acute renal failure (ARF) has been observed in patients after a single administration.Rare reports of hospitalization and/or dialysis or fatal outcome occurred in patients with underlying moderate to severe renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described in this section [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. Renal impairment may lead to increased exposure of concomitant medications and/or their metabolites that are primarily renally excreted [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using Cockcroft-Gault formula before each zoledronic acid injection dose. Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function; interim monitoring of creatinine clearance should be performed in at-risk patients. Elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy are at increased risk of acute renal failure. These patients should have their fluid status assessed and be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Consider monitoring creatinine clearance in patients at-risk for ARF who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ. While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Pregnancy ZOLEDRONIC ACID INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on zoledronic acid injection therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Consider withholding future zoledronic acid injection treatment if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. Use zoledronic acid injection with caution in aspirin-sensitive patients."

The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with zoledronic acid injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte AbnormalitiesElectrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of zoledronic acid injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including zoledronic acid injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4 months for other solid tumors. Table 6 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (<1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (>=1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving zoledronic acid injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9). Table 9: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Pamidronate 90 mg n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 27/246 (11%) 23/246 (9%) Abnormal 2/26 (8%) 2/22 (9%) Total 29/272 (11%) 25/268 (9%) Solid Tumors Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 17/154 (11%) 10/143 (7%) Abnormal 1/11 (9%) 1/20 (5%) Total 18/165 (11%) 11/163 (7%) Prostate Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 12/82 (15%) 8/68 (12%) Abnormal 4/10 (40%) 2/10 (20%) Total 16/92 (17%) 10/78 (13%) *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of zoledronic acid injection to 15 minutes. The risk of deterioration in renal function appeared to be related to time on study, whether patients were receiving zoledronic acid injection (4 mg over 15 minutes), placebo, or pamidronate. In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial zoledronic acid injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of zoledronic acid injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when zoledronic acid injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory : bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase,influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue, or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days;Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany, and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast(R).(5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting zoledronic acid injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D.Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10). 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with zoledronic acid injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with zoledronic acid injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of zoledronic acid injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with zoledronic acid injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 µmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment.Inthe clinicalstudies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 µmol/L or greater than 3 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine >2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of zoledronic acid injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of zoledronic acid injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use zoledronic acid injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harmwhen administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when zoledronic acid injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In-vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to 77%. In-vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In-vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with zoledronic acid for injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for zoledronic acid for injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid 4 mg given as a 15 minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Coadministration of thalidomide with zoledronic acid for injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact CARACO Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of zoledronic acid was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either zoledronic acid 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of zoledronic acid 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when zoledronic acid 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings And Precautions (5) and Dosage And Administration (2)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea. (see Table 4). Table 4 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg or Pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: Asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with zoledronic acid. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of zoledronic acid in patients with HCM are shown in Table 5 and 6.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including zoledronic acid. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2,042 patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for zoledronic acid 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4 months for other solid tumors. Table 7 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with zoledronic acid 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving zoledronic acid 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 10). Table 10: Percentage of Patients with Treatment Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum CreatinineTable includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of zoledronic acid to 15 minutes. Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Zoledronic Acid 4 mg Pamidronate 90 mg n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 27/246 (11%) 23/246 (9%) Abnormal 2/26 (8%) 2/22 (9%) Total 29/272 (11%) 25/268 (9%) Solid Tumors Zoledronic Acid 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 17/154 (11%) 10/143 (7%) Abnormal 1/11 (9%) 1/20 (5%) Total 18/165 (11%) 11/163 (7%) Prostate Cancer Zoledronic Acid 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 12/82 (15%) 8/68 (12%) Abnormal 4/10 (40%) 2/10 (20%) Total 16/92 (17%) 10/78 (13%) The risk of deterioration in renal function appeared to be related to time on study, whether patients were receiving zoledronic acid (4 mg over 15 minutes), placebo, or pamidronate. In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial zoledronic acid dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of zoledronic acid for injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid for injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings And Precautions (5)]. Acute Phase Reaction- Within three days after zoledronic acid administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings And Precautions (5 )]. Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema, and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS : taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses : blurred vision; Gastrointestinal : dry mouth; Skin : Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal : muscle cramps; Cardiovascular : hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory : bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive re-challenge; Renal : hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site : weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities : hyperkalemia, hypernatremia."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with zoledronic acid for injection should not be treated with Reclast(R)* (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of zoledronic acid for injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting zoledronic acid for injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, muscle pain may occur. Discontinue zoledronic acid for injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic acid for injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid for injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R)* (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with zoledronic acid for injection should not be treated with Reclast* or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid for injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with zoledronic acid for injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid for injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs.Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with zoledronic acid for injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of zoledronic acid for injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with zoledronic acid for injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid for injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 µmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid for injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 µmol/L or greater than 3 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with zoledronic acid for injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid for injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates.While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid for injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid for injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of zoledronic acid for injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid for injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of zoledronic acid for injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use zoledronic acid for injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid for injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid for injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and post-implantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS - Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods (7.1) - Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with zoledronic acid injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia (7.2) - Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution (7.3) In-vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to 77%. In-vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In-vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Coadministration of thalidomide with zoledronic acid injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events ( greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1 877 446 3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of zoledronic acid injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: Asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with zoledronic acid injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of zoledronic acid injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including zoledronic acid injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2,042 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4 months for other solid tumors. Table 6 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving zoledronic acid injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9). Table 9: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum CreatinineTable includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of zoledronic acid injection to 15 minutes.

In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial zoledronic acid injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of zoledronic acid injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when zoledronlc acid injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings And Precautions (5.4) ]. Acute Phase Reaction- Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema, and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia. Hypocalcemia, (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast(R) (5.1). -Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment (5.2) -Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose (5.3) -Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting zoledronic acid injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures (5.4) -Severe incapacitating bone, joint, muscle pain may occur. Discontinue zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur (5.5) -Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant (5.9, 8.1) -Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) -Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid injection 4 mg per 5 mL (concentrate for intravenous infusion) contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R), zoledronic acid injection 5 mg per 100 mL (solution for intravenous infusion). Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg per 5 mL (concentrate for intravenous infusion) should not be treated with Reclast(R) zoledronic acid injection 5 mg per 100 mL (solution for intravenous infusion) or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with zoledronic acid injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with zoledronic acid injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of zoledronic acid injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with zoledronic acid injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of zoledronic acid injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of zoledronic acid injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use zoledronic acid injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and post-implantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with Zoledronic acid injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when zoledronlc acid injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating zoledronlc acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to 77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with Zoledronic Acid Injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 15 minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Coadministration of thalidomide with zoledronic acid injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Akorn 1 800-932-5676 or FDA 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of zoledronic acid injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg or Pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug. Table 3.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with zoledronic acid injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of zoledronic acid injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and Table 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including zoledronic acid injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2,042 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors. Table 6 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9). Table 9: Percentage of Patients with Treatment Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* * Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zoledronic Acid Injection to 15 minutes.

In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial zoledronic acid injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of zoledronic acid injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Data suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R) (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zoledronic Acid Injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zoledronic Acid Injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic Acid Injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluated patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic Acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with zoledronic acid injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with zoledronic acid injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic Acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of zoledronic acid injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with zoledronic acid injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/ min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of zoledronic acid injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of zoledronic acid injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use zoledronic acid injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic Acid Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed for zoledronic acid injection. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood. In vitro mean zoledronic acid protein binding in human plasma ranged from 28% at 200 ng/mL to 53% at 50 ng/mL. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May lower serum calcium for prolonged periods (7.1) Loop diuretics: May increase risk of hypocalcemia (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution (7.3) Drugs primarily excreted by the kidney: Exposure may be increased with renal impairment. Monitor serum creatinine in patients at risk (7.4) 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 7.4 Drugs Primarily Excreted by the Kidney Renal impairment has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or other risk factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In patients with renal impairment, the exposure to concomitant medications that are primarily renally excreted (e.g., digoxin) may increase. Consider monitoring serum creatinine in patients at risk for renal impairment who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) were pyrexia, myalgia, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity (6.1). Other important adverse reactions were flu-like illness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (6.2), and eye inflammation (6.1).

Paget's Disease of Bone In the Paget's disease trials, two 6-month, double-blind, comparative, multinational studies of 349 men and women aged greater than 30 years with moderate to severe disease and with confirmed Paget's disease of bone, 177 patients were exposed to zoledronic acid injection and 172 patients exposed to risedronate. Zoledronic acid injection was administered once as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes. Risedronate was given as an oral daily dose of 30 mg for 2 months. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5.1% in the zoledronic acid injection group and 6.4% in the risedronate group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 1.7% and 1.2% for the zoledronic acid injection and risedronate groups, respectively. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of the Paget's patients receiving zoledronic acid injection (single 5 mg IV infusion) or risedronate (30 mg oral daily dose for 2 months) over a 6-month study period are listed by system organ class in Table 1.

Adverse Reactions Reported in at Least 2% of Paget's Patients Receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection (Single 5 mg IV Infusion) or Risedronate (Oral 30 mg Daily for 2 Months) Over a 6-Month Follow-Up Period System Organ Class 5 mg IV Zoledronic Acid % (N = 177) 30 mg/day x 2 Months risedronate % (N = 172) Infections and Infestations Influenza 7 5 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Hypocalcemia 3 1 Anorexia 2 2 Nervous System Disorders Headache 11 10 Dizziness 9 4 Lethargy 5 1 Paresthesia 2 0 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea 5 1 Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 9 6 Diarrhea 6 6 Constipation 6 5 Dyspepsia 5 4 Abdominal Distension 2 1 Abdominal Pain 2 2 Vomiting 2 2 Abdominal Pain Upper 1 2 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash 3 2 Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders Arthralgia 9 11 Bone Pain 9 5 Myalgia 7 4 Back Pain 4 7 Musculoskeletal Stiffness 2 1 General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions Influenza-like Illness 11 6 Pyrexia 9 2 Fatigue 8 4 Rigors 8 1 Pain 5 4 Peripheral Edema 3 1 Asthenia 2 1 Laboratory Findings In the Paget's disease trials, early, transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate levels were observed. Approximately 21% of patients had serum calcium levels less than 8.4 mg/dL 9 to 11 days following zoledronic acid injection administration. Renal Impairment In clinical trials in Paget's disease there were no cases of renal deterioration following a single 5 mg 15-minute infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Acute Phase Reaction The signs and symptoms of acute phase reaction (influenza-like illness, pyrexia, myalgia, arthralgia, and bone pain) were reported in 25% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection-treated group compared to 8% in the risedronate-treated group. Symptoms usually occur within the first 3 days following zoledronic acid injection administration. The majority of these symptoms resolved within 4 days of onset. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported with zoledronic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of zoledronic acid injection: Acute Phase Reactions Fever, headache, flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgia, and myalgia. Symptoms may be significant and lead to dehydration. Acute Renal Impairment Acute renal failure requiring hospitalization and/or dialysis or with a fatal outcome have been rarely reported. Increased serum creatinine was reported in patients with 1) underlying renal disease, 2) dehydration secondary to fever, sepsis, gastrointestinal losses, or diuretic therapy, or 3) other risk factors such as advanced age, or concomitant nephrotoxic drugs in the post-infusion period. Transient rise in serum creatinine can be correctable with intravenous fluids. Allergic Reactions Allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including anaphylactic reaction/shock, urticaria, angioedema, and bronchoconstriction have been reported. Asthma Exacerbations Asthma exacerbations have been reported. Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia have been reported. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of the following events have been reported: conjunctivitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, uveitis, episcleritis, scleritis, and orbital inflammation/edema. Other Hypotension in patients with underlying risk factors have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Product Containing Same Active Ingredient: Patients receiving Zometa should not receive Zoledronic Acid Injection (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Patients must be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (5.2) Renal Impairment: A single dose should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes. Renal toxicity may be greater in patient with underlying renal impairment or with other risk factors including, advanced age or dehydration. Monitor creatinine clearance before each dose (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported. All patients should have a routine oral exam by the prescriber prior to treatment (5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture (5.5) Pregnancy: Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised (5.6, 8.1) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle pain may occur. Withhold future doses of Zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur (5.6) 5.1 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient Zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient found in Zometa, used for oncology indications, and a patient being treated with Zometa should not be treated with zoledronic acid injection. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Pre-existing hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g., hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery; malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine) must be effectively treated before initiating therapy with zoledronic acid injection. Clinical monitoring of calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) is highly recommended for these patients [see Contraindications (4)]. Hypocalcemia following zoledronic acid injection administration is a significant risk in Paget's disease. All patients should be instructed about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in maintaining serum calcium levels [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Information for Patients (17)]. 5.3 Renal Impairment A single dose of zoledronic acid injection should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Zoledronic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min and in those with evidence of acute renal impairment. [see Contraindications (4)]. If history or physical signs suggest dehydration, zoledronic acid injection therapy should be withheld until normovolemic status has been achieved. [see Post-marketing Experience (6.2)] Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal impairment. Acute renal impairment, including renal failure has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise, advance age, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, concomitant diuretic therapy, or severe dehydration occurring before or after zoledronic acid injection administration. Acute renal failure (ARF) has been observed in patients after a single administration. Rare reports of hospitalization and/or dialysis or fatal outcome occurred in patients with underlying moderate to severe renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described in this section [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. Renal impairment may lead to increased exposure of concomitant medications and/or their metabolites that are primarily renally excreted [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using Cockcroft-Gault formula before each zoledronic acid injection dose. Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function; interim monitoring of creatinine clearance should be performed in at-risk patients. Elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy are at increased risk of acute renal failure. These patients should have their fluid status assessed and be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Consider monitoring creatinine clearance in patients at-risk for ARF who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefits assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Pregnancy ZOLEDRONIC ACID INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on zoledronic acid injection therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Consider withholding future zoledronic acid injection treatment if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. Use zoledronic acid injection with caution in aspirin-sensitive patients."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed for Reclast. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood. In vitro mean zoledronic acid protein binding in human plasma ranged from 28% at 200 ng/mL to 53% at 50 ng/mL. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May lower serum calcium for prolonged periods (7.1) Loop diuretics: May increase risk of hypocalcemia (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution (7.3) Drugs primarily excreted by the kidney: Exposure may be increased with renal impairment. Monitor serum creatinine in patients at risk (7.4) 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when Reclast is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when Reclast is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 7.4 Drugs Primarily Excreted by the Kidney Renal impairment has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or other risk factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In patients with renal impairment, the exposure to concomitant medications that are primarily renally excreted (e.g., digoxin) may increase. Consider monitoring serum creatinine in patients at risk for renal impairment who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) were pyrexia, myalgia, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity (6.1). Other important adverse reactions were flu-like illness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (6.2), and eye inflammation (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women The safety of Reclast in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in Study 1, a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of 7736 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 89 years with osteoporosis, diagnosed by bone mineral density or the presence of a prevalent vertebral fracture. The duration of the trial was three years with 3862 patients exposed to Reclast and 3852 patients exposed to placebo administered once annually as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes, for a total of three doses. All women received 1000 to 1500 mg of elemental calcium plus 400 to 1200 international units of vitamin D supplementation per day. The incidence of all-cause mortality was similar between groups: 3.4% in the Reclast group and 2.9% in the placebo group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 29.2% in the Reclast group and 30.1% in the placebo group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 5.4% and 4.8% for the Reclast and placebo groups, respectively. The safety of Reclast in the treatment of osteoporosis patients with a recent (within 90 days) low-trauma hip fracture was assessed in Study 2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational endpoint-driven study of 2127 men and women aged 50 to 95 years; 1065 patients were randomized to Reclast and 1062 patients were randomized to placebo. Reclast was administered once annually as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes. The study continued until at least 211 patients had a confirmed clinical fracture in the study population who were followed for an average of approximately 2 years on study drug. Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but a loading dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 international units orally or IM) was given to patients and they were started on 1000 to 1500 mg of elemental calcium plus 800 to 1200 international units of vitamin D supplementation per day for at least 14 days prior to the study drug infusions. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 9.6% in the Reclast group and 13.3% in the placebo group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 38.3% in the Reclast group and 41.3% in the placebo group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 5.3% and 4.7% for the Reclast and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients with osteoporosis and more frequently in the Reclast-treated patients than placebo-treated patients in either osteoporosis trial are shown below in Table 1.

In the clinical trial for postmenopausal osteoporosis, patients with baseline creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min (based on actual body weight), urine dipstick greater than or equal to 2+ protein or increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.5 mg/dL during the screening visits were excluded. The change in creatinine clearance (measured annually prior to dosing) and the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the Reclast and placebo treatment groups over 3 years, including patients with creatinine clearance between 30-60 mL/min at baseline. Overall, there was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed within 10 days of dosing in 1.8% of Reclast-treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients which resolved without specific therapy [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Acute Phase Reaction The signs and symptoms of acute phase reaction occurred in Study 1 following Reclast infusion including fever (18%), myalgia (9%), flu-like symptoms (8%), headache (7%), and arthralgia (7%). The majority of these symptoms occurred within the first 3 days following the dose of Reclast and usually resolved within 3 days of onset but resolution could take up to 7-14 days. In Study 2, patients without a contraindication to acetaminophen were provided with a standard oral dose at the time of the IV infusion and instructed to use additional acetaminophen at home for the next 72 hours as needed. Reclast was associated with fewer signs and symptoms of a transient acute phase reaction in this trial: fever (7%) and arthralgia (3%). The incidence of these symptoms decreased with subsequent doses of Reclast. Laboratory Findings In Study 1, in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, approximately 0.2% of patients had notable declines of serum calcium levels (less than 7.5 mg/dL) following Reclast administration. No symptomatic cases of hypocalcemia were observed. In Study 2, following pre-treatment with vitamin D, no patients had treatment emergent serum calcium levels below 7.5 mg/dL. Injection Site Reactions In the osteoporosis trials, local reactions at the infusion site such as itching, redness and/or pain have been reported in 0% to 0.7% of patients following the administration of Reclast and 0% to 0.5% of patients following administration of placebo. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw In the postmenopausal osteoporosis trial, Study 1, in 7736 patients, after initiation of therapy, symptoms consistent with ONJ occurred in one patient treated with placebo and one patient treated with Reclast. Both cases resolved after appropriate treatment [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. No reports of osteonecrosis of the jaw were reported in either treatment group in Study 2. Atrial Fibrillation In the postmenopausal osteoporosis trial, Study 1, adjudicated serious adverse events of atrial fibrillation in the zoledronic acid treatment group occurred in 1.3% of patients (50 out of 3862) compared to 0.4% (17 out of 3852) in the placebo group. The overall incidence of all atrial fibrillation adverse events in the zoledronic acid treatment group was reported in 2.5% of patients (96 out of 3862) in the Reclast group vs. 1.9% of patients (75 out of 3852) in the placebo group. Over 90% of these events in both treatment groups occurred more than a month after the infusion. In an ECG sub-study, ECG measurements were performed on a subset of 559 patients before and 9 to 11 days after treatment. There was no difference in the incidence of atrial fibrillation between treatment groups suggesting these events were not related to the acute infusions. In Study 2, adjudicated serious adverse events of atrial fibrillation in the zoledronic acid treatment group occurred in 1.0% of patients (11 out of 1054) compared to 1.2% (13 out of 1057) in the placebo group demonstrating no difference between treatment groups. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of iritis/uveitis/episcleritis/conjunctivitis have been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid. In the osteoporosis trials, 1 (less than 0.1%) to 9 (0.2%) patients treated with Reclast and 0 (0%) to 1 (less than 0.1%) patient treated with placebo developed iritis/uveitis/episcleritis. Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women The safety of Reclast in postmenopausal women with osteopenia (low bone mass) was assessed in a 2-year randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 581 postmenopausal women aged greater than or equal to 45 years. Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups: (1) Reclast given at randomization and Month 12 (n=198); (2) Reclast given at randomization and placebo at Month 12 (n=181); and (3) placebo given at randomization and Month 12 (n=202). Reclast was administered as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes. All women received 500 to 1200 mg elemental calcium plus 400 to 800 international units vitamin D supplementation per day. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar for subjects given (1) Reclast at randomization and at Month 12 (10.6%), (2) Reclast at randomization and placebo given at Month 12 (9.4%), and (3) placebo at randomization and at Month 12 (11.4%). The percentages of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events were 7.1%, 7.2%, and 3.0% in the two Reclast groups and placebo group, respectively. Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients with osteopenia and more frequently in the Reclast-treated patients than placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

In the osteoporosis prevention trial, 4 (1.1%) patients treated with Reclast and 0 (0%) patients treated with placebo developed iritis/uveitis. Acute Phase Reaction In patients given Reclast at randomization and placebo at Month 12, Reclast was associated with signs and symptoms of an acute phase reaction: myalgia (20.4%), fever (19.3%), chills (18.2%), pain (13.8%), headache (13.3%), fatigue (8.3%), arthralgia (6.1%), pain in extremity (3.9%), influenza-like illness (3.3%), and back pain (1.7%), which occurred within the first 3 days following the dose of Reclast. The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate and resolved within 3 days of the event onset but resolution could take up to 7-14 days. Osteoporosis in Men The safety of Reclast in men with osteoporosis or osteoporosis secondary to hypogonadism was assessed in a two year randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active controlled group study of 302 men aged 25 to 86 years. One hundred fifty three (153) patients were exposed to Reclast administered once annually with a 5 mg dose in 100 mL infused over 15 minutes for up to a total of two doses, and 148 patients were exposed to a commercially-available oral weekly bisphosphonate (active control) for up to two years. All participants received 1000 mg of elemental calcium plus 800 to 1000 international units of vitamin D supplementation per day. The incidence of all-cause mortality (one in each group) and serious adverse events were similar between the Reclast and active control treatment groups. The percentage of patients experiencing at least one adverse event was comparable between the Reclast and active control groups, with the exception of a higher incidence of post-dose symptoms in the Reclast group that occurred within 3 days after infusion. The overall safety and tolerability of Reclast was similar to the active control. Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of men with osteoporosis and more frequently in the Reclast-treated patients than the active control-treated patients and either (1) not reported in the postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment trial or (2) reported more frequently in the trial of osteoporosis in men are presented in Table 3. Therefore, Table 3 should be viewed in conjunction with Table 1. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of Men with Osteoporosis and More Frequently in the Reclast-Treated Patients than the Active Control-Treated Patients and either (1) Not Reported in the Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Treatment Trial or (2) Reported More Frequently in this Trial * Combined abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, and abdominal pain lower as one ADR ** Combined musculoskeletal pain and musculoskeletal chest pain as one ADR System Organ Class 5 mg IV Reclast once per year % (N=153) Active Control once weekly % (N=148) Nervous System Disorders Headache 15.0 6.1 Lethargy 3.3 1.4 Eye Disorders Eye pain 2.0 0.0 Cardiac Disorders Atrial fibrillation 3.3 2.0 Palpitations 2.6 0.0 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea 6.5 4.7 Abdominal pain* 7.9 4.1 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hyperhidrosis 2.6 2.0 Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders Myalgia 19.6 6.8 Musculoskeletal pain** 12.4 10.8 Musculoskeletal stiffness 4.6 0.0 Renal and Urinary Disorders Blood creatinine increased 2.0 0.7 General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions Fatigue 17.6 6.1 Pain 11.8 4.1 Chills 9.8 2.7 Influenza-like illness 9.2 2.0 Malaise 7.2 0.7 Acute phase reaction 3.9 0.0 Investigations C-reactive protein increased 4.6 1.4 Renal Impairment Creatinine clearance was measured annually prior to dosing and changes in long-term renal function over 24 months were comparable in the Reclast and active control groups [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate and resolved within 3 days of the event onset but resolution could take up to 7-14 days. The incidence of these symptoms decreased with subsequent doses of Reclast. Atrial Fibrillation The incidence of all atrial fibrillation adverse events in the Reclast treatment group was 3.3% (5 out of 153) compared to 2.0% (3 out of 148) in the active control group. However, there were no patients with adjudicated serious adverse events of atrial fibrillation in the Reclast treatment group. Laboratory Findings There were no patients who had treatment emergent serum calcium levels below 7.5 mg/dL. Injection Site Reactions There were 4 patients (2.6%) on Reclast vs. 2 patients (1.4%) on active control with local site reactions. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw In this trial there were no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis The safety of Reclast in men and women in the treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active controlled, stratified study of 833 men and women aged 18 to 85 years treated with greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent). Patients were stratified according to the duration of their pre-study corticosteroid therapy: less than or equal to 3 months prior to randomization (prevention subpopulation), and greater than 3 months prior to randomization (treatment subpopulation). The duration of the trial was one year with 416 patients exposed to Reclast administered once as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL infused over 15 minutes, and 417 patients exposed to a commercially-available oral daily bisphosphonate (active control) for one year. All participants received 1000 mg of elemental calcium plus 400 to 1000 international units of vitamin D supplementation per day. The incidence of all-cause mortality was similar between treatment groups: 0.9% in the Reclast group and 0.7% in the active control group. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the Reclast treatment and prevention groups, 18.4% and 18.1%, respectively, and the active control treatment and prevention groups, 19.8% and 16.0%, respectively. The percentage of subjects who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 2.2% in the Reclast group vs. 1.4% in the active control group. The overall safety and tolerability were similar between Reclast and active control groups with the exception of a higher incidence of post-dose symptoms in the Reclast group that occurred within 3 days after infusion. The overall safety and tolerability profile of Reclast in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was similar to the adverse events reported in the Reclast postmenopausal osteoporosis clinical trial. Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients that were either not reported in the postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment trial or reported more frequently in the treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis trial included the following: abdominal pain (Reclast 7.5%; active control 5.0%), and musculoskeletal pain (Reclast 3.1%; active control 1.7%). Other musculoskeletal events included back pain (Reclast 4.3%, active control 6.2%), bone pain (Reclast 3.1%, active control 2.2%), and pain in the extremity (Reclast 3.1%, active control 1.2%). In addition, the following adverse events occurred more frequently than in the postmenopausal osteoporosis trial: nausea (Reclast 9.6%; active control 8.4%), and dyspepsia (Reclast 5.5%; active control 4.3%). Renal Impairment Renal function measured prior to dosing and at the end of the 12 month study was comparable in the Reclast and active control groups [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Acute Phase Reaction Reclast was associated with signs and symptoms of a transient acute phase reaction that was similar to that seen in the Reclast postmenopausal osteoporosis clinical trial. Atrial Fibrillation The incidence of atrial fibrillation adverse events was 0.7% (3 of 416) in the Reclast group compared to no adverse events in the active control group. All subjects had a prior history of atrial fibrillation and no cases were adjudicated as serious adverse events. One patient had atrial flutter in the active control group. Laboratory Findings There were no patients who had treatment emergent serum calcium levels below 7.5 mg/dL. Injection Site Reactions There were no local reactions at the infusion site. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw In this trial there were no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Paget's Disease of Bone In the Paget's disease trials, two 6-month, double-blind, comparative, multinational studies of 349 men and women aged greater than 30 years with moderate to severe disease and with confirmed Paget's disease of bone, 177 patients were exposed to Reclast and 172 patients exposed to risedronate. Reclast was administered once as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes. Risedronate was given as an oral daily dose of 30 mg for 2 months. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5.1% in the Reclast group and 6.4% in the risedronate group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 1.7% and 1.2% for the Reclast and risedronate groups, respectively. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of the Paget's patients receiving Reclast (single 5 mg intravenous infusion) or risedronate (30 mg oral daily dose for 2 months) over a 6-month study period are listed by system organ class in Table 4. Table 4. Adverse Reactions Reported in at Least 2% of Paget's Patients Receiving Reclast (Single 5 mg intravenous Infusion) or Risedronate (Oral 30 mg Daily for 2 Months) Over a 6-Month Follow-Up Period System Organ Class 5 mg IV Reclast % (N = 177) 30 mg/day x 2 Months risedronate % (N = 172) Infections and Infestations Influenza 7 5 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Hypocalcemia 3 1 Anorexia 2 2 Nervous System Disorders Headache 11 10 Dizziness 9 4 Lethargy 5 1 Paresthesia 2 0 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea 5 1 Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 9 6 Diarrhea 6 6 Constipation 6 5 Dyspepsia 5 4 Abdominal Distension 2 1 Abdominal Pain 2 2 Vomiting 2 2 Abdominal Pain Upper 1 2 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash 3 2 Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders Arthralgia 9 11 Bone Pain 9 5 Myalgia 7 4 Back Pain 4 7 Musculoskeletal Stiffness 2 1 General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions Influenza-like Illness 11 6 Pyrexia 9 2 Fatigue 8 4 Rigors 8 1 Pain 5 4 Peripheral Edema 3 1 Asthenia 2 1 Laboratory Findings In the Paget's disease trials, early, transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate levels were observed. Approximately 21% of patients had serum calcium levels less than 8.4 mg/dL 9-11 days following Reclast administration. Renal Impairment In clinical trials in Paget's disease there were no cases of renal deterioration following a single 5 mg 15-minute infusion [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Acute Phase Reaction The signs and symptoms of acute phase reaction (influenza-like illness, pyrexia, myalgia, arthralgia, and bone pain) were reported in 25% of patients in the Reclast-treated group compared to 8% in the risedronate-treated group. Symptoms usually occur within the first 3 days following Reclast administration. The majority of these symptoms resolved within 4 days of onset. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported with zoledronic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Reclast: Acute Phase Reactions Fever, headache, flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgia, and myalgia. Symptoms may be significant and lead to dehydration. Acute Renal Failure Acute renal failure requiring hospitalization and/or dialysis or with a fatal outcome have been rarely reported. Increased serum creatinine was reported in patients with 1) underlying renal disease, 2) dehydration secondary to fever, sepsis, gastrointestinal losses, or diuretic therapy, or 3) other risk factors such as advanced age, or concomitant nephrotoxic drugs in the post-infusion period. Transient rise in serum creatinine can be correctable with intravenous fluids. Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions with intravenous zoledronic acid including anaphylactic reaction/shock, urticaria, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and bronchoconstriction have been reported. Asthma Exacerbations Asthma exacerbations have been reported. Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Osteonecrosis of other bones Cases of osteonecrosis of other bones (including femur, hip, knee, ankle, wrist and humerus) have been reported; causality has not been determined in the population treated with Reclast. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of the following events have been reported: conjunctivitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, uveitis, episcleritis, scleritis and orbital inflammation/edema. Other Hypotension in patients with underlying risk factors has been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Products Containing Same Active Ingredient: Patients receiving Zometa should not receive Reclast (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Patients must be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (5.2) Renal Impairment: A single dose should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes. Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with underlying renal impairment or with other risk factors, including advanced age or dehydration. Monitor creatinine clearance before each dose (2.7, 5.3) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) has been reported. All patients should have a routine oral exam by the prescriber prior to treatment (5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture (5.5) Pregnancy: Reclast can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised (5.6, 8.1) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Withhold future doses of Reclast if severe symptoms occur (5.7) 5.1 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient Reclast contains the same active ingredient found in Zometa, used for oncology indications, and a patient being treated with Zometa should not be treated with Reclast. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Pre-existing hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g., hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery; malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine) must be effectively treated before initiating therapy with Reclast. Clinical monitoring of calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) is highly recommended for these patients [see Contraindications (4)]. Hypocalcemia following Reclast administration is a significant risk in Paget's disease. All patients should be instructed about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in maintaining serum calcium levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Information for Patients (17)]. All osteoporosis patients should be instructed on the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in maintaining serum calcium levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Information for Patients (17)]. 5.3 Renal Impairment A single dose of Reclast should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Reclast is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min and in those with evidence of acute renal impairment [see Contraindications (4)]. If history or physical signs suggest dehydration, Reclast therapy should be withheld until normovolemic status has been achieved [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. Reclast should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal impairment. Acute renal impairment, including renal failure, has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise, advanced age, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, concomitant diuretic therapy, or severe dehydration occurring before or after Reclast administration. Acute renal failure (ARF) has been observed in patients after a single administration. Rare reports of hospitalization and/or dialysis or fatal outcome occurred in patients with underlying moderate to severe renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described in this section [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. Renal impairment may lead to increased exposure of concomitant medications and/or their metabolites that are primarily renally excreted [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using Cockcroft-Gault formula before each Reclast dose. Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function; interim monitoring of creatinine clearance should be performed in at-risk patients. Elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy are at increased risk of acute renal failure. These patients should have their fluid status assessed and be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Reclast. Reclast should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Consider monitoring creatinine clearance in patients at-risk for ARF who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. Some cases have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with either oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ. While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Pregnancy RECLAST SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY. Reclast may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on Reclast therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Reclast. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Consider withholding future Reclast treatment if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Reclast, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. Use Reclast with caution in aspirin-sensitive patients."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60%-77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with Zoledronic Acid Injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in Zoledronic Acid Injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1-14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15-28). Coadministration of thalidomide with Zoledronic Acid Injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of Zoledronic Acid Injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33-84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse reactions were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 4). Table 4 provides adverse reactions that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse reactions are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse reactions are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of Zoledronic Acid Injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 5 and 6.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24-48 hours. Ocular Adverse Reactions Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis, or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors. Table 7 describes adverse reactions that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse reactions are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse reactions reported more often with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 10). Table 10: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zoledronic Acid Injection to 15 minutes.

In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial Zoledronic Acid Injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Reactions Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R). (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zoledronic Acid Injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zoledronic Acid Injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic Acid Injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic Acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zoledronic Acid Injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zoledronic Acid Injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic Acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zoledronic Acid Injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Zoledronic Acid Injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Zoledronic Acid Injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of Zoledronic Acid Injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use Zoledronic Acid Injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as Zoledronic Acid Injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic Acid Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to 77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with Zoledronic Acid Injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in Zoledronic Acid Injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Coadministration of thalidomide with Zoledronic Acid Injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of Zoledronic Acid Injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 4). Table 4 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, non-specific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of Zoledronic Acid Injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 5 and 6.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis, or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors. Table 7 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 10). Table 10: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zoledronic Acid Injection to 15 minutes.

In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial Zoledronic Acid Injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses : blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal : dry mouth; Skin : Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal : muscle cramps; Cardiovascular : hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory : bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal : hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities : hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany, and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R). (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zoledronic Acid Injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zoledronic Acid Injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic Acid Injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic Acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zoledronic Acid Injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zoledronic Acid Injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic Acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Pre-existing renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zoledronic Acid Injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Zoledronic Acid Injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Zoledronic Acid Injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of Zoledronic Acid Injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use Zoledronic Acid Injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as Zoledronic Acid Injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic Acid Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Aminoglycosides: May lower serum calcium for prolonged periods (7.1) Loop diuretics: May increase risk of hypocalcemia(7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution(7.3) Drugs primarily excreted by the kidney: Exposure may be increased with renal impairment. Monitor serum creatinine in patients at risk (7.4) No in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed for zoledronic acid injection. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood. In vitro mean zoledronic acid protein binding in human plasma ranged from 28% at 200 ng/mL to 53% at 50 ng/mL. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 7.4 Drugs Primarily Excreted by the Kidney Renal impairment has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or other risk factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In patients with renal impairment, the exposure to concomitant medications that are primarily renally excreted (e.g., digoxin) may increase. Consider monitoring serum creatinine in patients at risk for renal impairment who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) were pyrexia, myalgia, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity (6.1). Other important adverse reactions were flu-like illness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (6.2),and eye inflammation (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-866-901-DRUG (3784) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Paget's Disease of Bone In the Paget's disease trials, two 6-month, double-blind, comparative, multinational studies of 349 men and women aged greater than 30 years with moderate to severe disease and with confirmed Paget's disease of bone, 177 patients were exposed to zoledronic acid injection and 172 patients exposed to risedronate. Zoledronic acid injection was administered once as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes. Risedronate was given as an oral daily dose of 30 mg for 2 months. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5.1% in the zoledronic acid injection group and 6.4% in the risedronate group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 1.7% and 1.2% for the zoledronic acid injection and risedronate groups, respectively. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of the Paget's patients receiving zoledronic acid injection (single 5 mg intravenous infusion) or risedronate (30 mg oral daily dose for 2 months) over a 6-month study period are listed by system organ class in Table 4.

Approximately 21% of patients had serum calcium levels less than 8.4 mg/dL 9 to 11 days following zoledronic acid injection administration. Renal Impairment In clinical trials in Paget's disease there were no cases of renal deterioration following a single 5 mg 15-minute infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Acute Phase Reaction The signs and symptoms of acute phase reaction (influenza-like illness, pyrexia, myalgia, arthralgia, and bone pain) were reported in 25% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection-treated group compared to 8% in the risedronate-treated group. Symptoms usually occur within the first 3 days following zoledronic acid injection administration. The majority of these symptoms resolved within 4 days of onset. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported with zoledronic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of zoledronic acid injection: Acute Phase Reactions Fever, headache, flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgia, and myalgia. Symptoms may be significant and lead to dehydration. Acute Renal Failure Acute renal failure requiring hospitalization and/or dialysis or with a fatal outcome have been rarely reported. Increased serum creatinine was reported in patients with 1) underlying renal disease, 2) dehydration secondary to fever, sepsis, gastrointestinal losses, or diuretic therapy, or 3) other risk factors such as advanced age, or concomitant nephrotoxic drugs in the post-infusion period. Transient rise in serum creatinine can be correctable with intravenous fluids. Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions with intravenous zoledronic acid including anaphylactic reaction/shock, urticaria, angioedema, Stevens- Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and bronchoconstriction have been reported. Asthma Exacerbations Asthma exacerbations have been reported. Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of the following events have been reported: conjunctivitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, uveitis, episcleritis, scleritis and orbital inflammation/edema. Other Hypotension in patients with underlying risk factors has been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Products Containing Same Active Ingredient: Patients receiving Zometa should not receive zoledronic acid injection (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Patients must be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (5.2) Renal Impairment: A single dose should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes. Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with underlying renal impairment or with other risk factors, including advanced age or dehydration.Monitor creatinine clearance before each dose (2.7, 5.3) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) has been reported. All patients should have a routine oral exam by the prescriber prior to treatment(5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture(5.5). Pregnancy: Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised (5.6,8.1) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Withhold future doses of zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur (5.7) 5.1 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient Zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient found in Zometa, used for oncology indications, and a patient being treated with Zometa should not be treated with zoledronic acid injection. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Pre-existing hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g., hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery; malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine) must be effectively treated before initiating therapy with zoledronic acid injection. Clinical monitoring of calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) is highly recommended for these patients [see Contraindications (4)]. Hypocalcemia following zoledronic acid injection administration is a significant risk in Paget's disease. All patients should be instructed about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in maintaining serum calcium levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Information for Patients (17)]. 5.3 Renal Impairment A single dose of zoledronic acid injection should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes.[see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Zoledronic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min and in those with evidence of acute renal impairment. [see Contraindications (4)]. If history or physical signs suggest dehydration, zoledronic acid injection therapy should be withheld until normovolemic status has been achieved. [See Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)] Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal impairment. Acute renal impairment, including renal failure, has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise, advanced age, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, concomitant diuretic therapy, or severe dehydration occurring before or after zoledronic acid injection administration. Acute renal failure (ARF) has been observed in patients after a single administration.Rare reports of hospitalization and/or dialysis or fatal outcome occurred in patients with underlying moderate to severe renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described in this section [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2)]. Renal impairment may lead to increased exposure of concomitant medications and/or their metabolites that are primarily renally excreted [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using Cockcroft-Gault formula before each zoledronic acid injection dose. Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function; interim monitoring of creatinine clearance should be performed in at-risk patients. Elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy are at increased risk of acute renal failure. These patients should have their fluid status assessed and be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Consider monitoring creatinine clearance in patients at-risk for ARF who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ. While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Pregnancy ZOLEDRONIC ACID INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on zoledronic acid injection therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Consider withholding future zoledronic acid injection treatment if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. Use zoledronic acid injection with caution in aspirin-sensitive patients."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60 to 77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with zoledronic acid may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for zoledronic acid 4 mg is needed when co-administered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Co-administration of thalidomide with zoledronic acid did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. at 1-877-233-2001 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of zoledronic acid was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either zoledronic acid 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of zoledronic acid 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when zoledronic acid 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 4). Table 4 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with zoledronic acid. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of zoledronic acid in patients with HCM are shown in Table 5 and 6.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including zoledronic acid. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in post-marketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for zoledronic acid 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4 months for other solid tumors. Table 7 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with zoledronic acid 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving zoledronic acid 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 10). Table 10: Percentage of Patients with Treatment Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Pamidronate 90 mg n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal Abnormal Total 27/246 2/26 29/272 (11%) (8%) (11%) 23/246 2/22 25/268 (9%) (9%) (9%) Solid Tumors Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal Abnormal Total 17/154 1/11 18/165 (11%) (9%) (11%) 10/143 1/20 11/163 (7%) (5%) (7%) Prostate Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal Abnormal Total 12/82 4/10 16/92 (15%) (40%) (17%) 8/68 2/10 10/78 (12%) (20%) (13%) * Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of zoledronic acid to 15 minutes. The risk of deterioration in renal function appeared to be related to time on study, whether patients were receiving zoledronic acid (4 mg over 15 minutes), placebo, or pamidronate. In the trials and in post marketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial zoledronic acid dose. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of zoledronic acid. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when zoledronic acid is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during post marketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in post marketing use include: CNS : taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses : blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal : dry mouth; Skin : Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal : muscle cramps; Cardiovascular : hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive re-challenge; Renal : hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site : weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities : hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany, and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with zoledronic acid should not be treated with Reclast(R). (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of zoledronic acid and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting zoledronic acid. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue zoledronic acid if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic acid can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating zoledronic acid. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia. (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with zoledronic acid should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with zoledronic acid in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with zoledronic acid. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of zoledronic acid and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with zoledronic acid. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 mcmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 mcmol/L or greater than 3 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Post marketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In post marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of zoledronic acid therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of zoledronic acid to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use zoledronic acid in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and post-implantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when zoledronic acid is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating zoledronic acid. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. - Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) - Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with Zoledronic acid Injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) - Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in Zoledronic acid Injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when Zoledronic acid Injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when Zoledronic acid Injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Coadministration of thalidomide with Zoledronic acid Injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of Zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea .(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of Zoledronic acid Injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with Zoledronic acid Injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of Zoledronic acid Injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including Zoledronic acid Injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors.

Less common adverse events reported more often with Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9). Table 9: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg Pamidronate 90 mg n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 27/246 (11%) 23/246 (9%) Abnormal 2/26 (8%) 2/22 (9%) Total 29/272 (11%) 25/268 (9%) Solid Tumors Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 17/154 (11%) 10/143 (7%) Abnormal 1/11 (9%) 1/20 (5%) Total 18/165 (11%) 11/163 (7%) Prostate Cancer Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 12/82 (15%) 8/68 (12%) Abnormal 4/10 (40%) 2/10 (20%) Total 16/92 (17%) 10/78 (13%) *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zoledronic acid Injection to 15 minutes. The risk of deterioration in renal function appeared to be related to time on study, whether patients were receiving Zoledronic acid Injection (4 mg over 15 minutes), placebo, or pamidronate. In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial Zoledronic acid Injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Zoledronic acid Injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including Zoledronic acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when Zoledronic acid Injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. A typical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic acid Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported.Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS : tastedisturbance, hyperesthesia,tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal: drymouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease(ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise)persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany, and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Patients being treated with Zoledronic acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R).(5.1) - Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) - Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) - Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zoledronic acid Injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) - Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zoledronic acid Injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) - Zoledronic acid Injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant.(5.9, 8.1) -Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) - Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating Zoledronic acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zoledronic acid Injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zoledronic acid Injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zoledronic acid Injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zoledronic acid Injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 mcmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 mcmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid Injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic acid Injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Zoledronic acid Injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Zoledronic acid Injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of Zoledronic acid Injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use Zoledronic acid Injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as Zoledronic acid Injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with Zoledronic acid Injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when Zoledronic acid Injectionis administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating Zoledronic acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to 77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with zoledronic acid injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Coadministration of thalidomide with zoledronic acid injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of zoledronic acid injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with zoledronic acid injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of zoledronic acid injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including zoledronic acid injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis, or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2,042 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4 months for other solid tumors.

Less common adverse events reported more often with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving zoledronic acid injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9). Table 9: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum CreatinineTable includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of zoledronic acid injection to 15 minutes.

In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial zoledronic acid injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of zoledronic acid injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when zoledronic acid injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 ) ]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS : taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses : blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal : dry mouth; Skin : Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal : muscle cramps; Cardiovascular : hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal : hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site : weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities : hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany, and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast(R)* (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting zoledronic acid injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R)* (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast* or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with zoledronic acid injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with zoledronic acid injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of zoledronic acid injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with zoledronic acid injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of zoledronic acid injectiontherapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of zoledronic acid injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use zoledronic acid injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when zoledronic acid injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. - Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) - Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with Zoledronic acid Injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) - Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in Zoledronic acid Injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when Zoledronic acid Injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when Zoledronic acid Injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Coadministration of thalidomide with Zoledronic acid Injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of Zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of Zoledronic acid Injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with Zoledronic acid Injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of Zoledronic acid Injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including Zoledronic acid Injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions(6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors. Table 6 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9). Table 9: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg Pamidronate 90 mg n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 27/246 (11%) 23/246 (9%) Abnormal 2/26 (8%) 2/22 (9%) Total 29/272 (11%) 25/268 (9%) Solid Tumors Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 17/154 (11%) 10/143 (7%) Abnormal 1/11 (9%) 1/20 (5%) Total 18/165 (11%) 11/163 (7%) Prostate Cancer Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 12/82 (15%) 8/68 (12%) Abnormal 4/10 (40%) 2/10 (20%) Total 16/92 (17%) 10/78 (13%) *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zoledronic acid Injection to 15 minutes. The risk of deterioration in renal function appeared to be related to time on study, whether patients were receiving Zoledronic acid Injection (4 mg over 15 minutes), placebo, or pamidronate. In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial Zoledronic acid Injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Zoledronic acid Injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw but also of other anatomical sites including hip, femur and external auditory canal) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including Zoledronic acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when Zoledronic acid Injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. A typical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic acid Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS : taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia,hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany, and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Patients being treated with Zoledronic acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R). (5.1) - Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) - Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) - Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zoledronic acid Injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) - Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zoledronic acid Injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) - Zoledronic acid Injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) - Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) - Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating Zoledronic acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R)(zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic acid Injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zoledronic acid Injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zoledronic acid Injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zoledronic acid Injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zoledronic acid Injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 mcmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 mcmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zoledronic acid Injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid Injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic acid Injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Zoledronic acid Injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Zoledronic acid Injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of Zoledronic acid Injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use Zoledronic acid Injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as Zoledronic acid Injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with Zoledronic acid Injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when Zoledronic acid Injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating Zoledronic acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to 77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with zoledronic acid injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15 to 28). Coadministration of thalidomide with zoledronic acid injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. REDDY'S LABORATORIES Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of zoledronic acid injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with zoledronic acid injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte AbnormalitiesElectrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of zoledronic acid injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including zoledronic acid injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4 months for other solid tumors.

Less common adverse events reported more often with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (<1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (>=1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving zoledronic acid injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9). Table 9: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Pamidronate 90 mg n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 27/246 (11%) 23/246 (9%) Abnormal 2/26 (8%) 2/22 (9%) Total 29/272 (11%) 25/268 (9%) Solid Tumors Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 17/154 (11%) 10/143 (7%) Abnormal 1/11 (9%) 1/20 (5%) Total 18/165 (11%) 11/163 (7%) Prostate Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 12/82 (15%) 8/68 (12%) Abnormal 4/10 (40%) 2/10 (20%) Total 16/92 (17%) 10/78 (13%) *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of zoledronic acid injection to 15 minutes. The risk of deterioration in renal function appeared to be related to time on study, whether patients were receiving zoledronic acid injection (4 mg over 15 minutes), placebo, or pamidronate. In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial zoledronic acid injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of zoledronic acid injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when zoledronic acid injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory : bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase,influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue, or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days;Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany, and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast(R).(5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting zoledronic acid injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D.Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10). 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with zoledronic acid injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with zoledronic acid injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of zoledronic acid injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with zoledronic acid injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 µmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment.Inthe clinicalstudies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 µmol/L or greater than 3 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine >2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of zoledronic acid injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of zoledronic acid injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use zoledronic acid injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harmwhen administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when zoledronic acid injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60%-77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with Zoledronic Acid Injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in Zoledronic Acid Injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1-14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15-28). Coadministration of thalidomide with Zoledronic Acid Injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of Zoledronic Acid Injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33-84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse reactions were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 4). Table 4 provides adverse reactions that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse reactions are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse reactions are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of Zoledronic Acid Injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 5 and 6.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24-48 hours. Ocular Adverse Reactions Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis, or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors.

Less common adverse reactions reported more often with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 10). Table 10: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zoledronic Acid Injection to 15 minutes.

In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial Zoledronic Acid Injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Reactions Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R). (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zoledronic Acid Injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zoledronic Acid Injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic Acid Injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic Acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zoledronic Acid Injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zoledronic Acid Injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic Acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zoledronic Acid Injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Zoledronic Acid Injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Zoledronic Acid Injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of Zoledronic Acid Injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use Zoledronic Acid Injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as Zoledronic Acid Injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic Acid Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed for zoledronic acid injection. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood. In vitro mean zoledronic acid protein binding in human plasma ranged from 28% at 200 ng/mL to 53% at 50 ng/mL. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May lower serum calcium for prolonged periods (7.1) Loop diuretics: May increase risk of hypocalcemia (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution (7.3) Drugs primarily excreted by the kidney: Exposure may be increased with renal impairment. Monitor serum creatinine in patients at risk (7.4) 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 7.4 Drugs Primarily Excreted by the Kidney Renal impairment has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or other risk factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. In patients with renal impairment, the exposure to concomitant medications that are primarily renally excreted (e.g., digoxin) may increase. Consider monitoring serum creatinine in patients at risk for renal impairment who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) were pyrexia, myalgia, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity (6.1) Other important adverse reactions were flu-like illness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (6.2), and eye inflammation (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. REDDY'S LABORATORIES Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Paget's Disease of Bone In the Paget's disease trials, two 6-month, double-blind, comparative, multinational studies of 349 men and women aged greater than 30 years with moderate to severe disease and with confirmed Paget's disease of bone, 177 patients were exposed to zoledronic acid injection and 172 patients exposed to risedronate. Zoledronic acid injection was administered once as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes. Risedronate was given as an oral daily dose of 30 mg for 2 months. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5.1% in the zoledronic acid injection group and 6.4% in the risedronate group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 1.7% and 1.2% for the zoledronic acid injection and risedronate groups, respectively. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of the Paget's patients receiving zoledronic acid injection (single 5 mg intravenous infusion) or risedronate (30 mg oral daily dose for 2 months) over a 6-month study period are listed by system organ class in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in at Least 2% of Paget's Patients Receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection (Single 5 mg intravenous Infusion) or Risedronate (Oral 30 mg Daily for 2 Months) Over a 6-Month Follow-Up Period System Organ Class 5 mg IV Zoledronic Acid Injection % (N = 177) 30 mg/day x 2 Months risedronate % (N = 172) Infections and Infestations Influenza 7 5 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Hypocalcemia 3 1 Anorexia 2 2 Nervous System Disorders Headache 11 10 Dizziness 9 4 Lethargy 5 1 Paresthesia 2 0 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea 5 1 Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 9 6 Diarrhea 6 6 Constipation 6 5 Dyspepsia 5 4 Abdominal Distension 2 1 Abdominal Pain 2 2 Vomiting 2 2 Abdominal Pain Upper 1 2 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash 3 2 Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders Arthralgia 9 11 Bone Pain 9 5 Myalgia 7 4 Back Pain 4 7 Musculoskeletal Stiffness 2 1 General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions Influenza-like Illness 11 6 Pyrexia 9 2 Fatigue 8 4 Rigors 8 1 Pain 5 4 Peripheral Edema 3 1 Asthenia 2 1 Laboratory Findings In the Paget's disease trials, early, transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate levels were observed. Approximately 21% of patients had serum calcium levels less than 8.4 mg/dL 9 to 11 days following zoledronic acid injection administration. Renal Impairment In clinical trials in Paget's disease there were no cases of renal deterioration following a single 5 mg 15-minute infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Acute Phase Reaction The signs and symptoms of acute phase reaction (influenza-like illness, pyrexia, myalgia, arthralgia, and bone pain) were reported in 25% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection-treated group compared to 8% in the risedronate-treated group. Symptoms usually occur within the first 3 days following zoledronic acid injection administration. The majority of these symptoms resolved within 4 days of onset. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported with zoledronic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of zoledronic acid injection: Acute Phase Reactions Fever, headache, flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgia, and myalgia. Symptoms may be significant and lead to dehydration. Acute Renal Failure Acute renal failure requiring hospitalization and/or dialysis or with a fatal outcome have been rarely reported.Increased serum creatinine was reported in patients with 1) underlying renal disease, 2) dehydration secondary to fever, sepsis, gastrointestinal losses, or diuretic therapy, or 3) other risk factors such as advanced age, or concomitant nephrotoxic drugs in the post-infusion period. Transient rise in serum creatinine can be correctable with intravenous fluids. Allergic Reactions Allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including anaphylactic reaction/shock, urticaria, angioedema, and bronchoconstriction have been reported. Asthma Exacerbations Asthma exacerbations have been reported. Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of the following events have been reported: conjunctivitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, uveitis, episcleritis, scleritis, and orbital inflammation/edema. Other Hypotension in patients with underlying risk factors have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Products Containing Same Active Ingredient: Patients receiving Zometa should not receive zoledronic acid injection (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Patients must be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (5.2) Renal Impairment: A single dose should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes. Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with underlying renal impairment or with other risk factors, including advanced age or dehydration. Monitor creatinine clearance before each dose (2, 5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported. All patients should have a routine oral exam by the prescriber prior to treatment (5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture (5.5). Pregnancy: Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised (5.6, 8.1) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Withhold future doses of zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur (5.7) 5.1 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient Zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient found in Zometa, used for oncology indications, and a patient being treated with Zometa should not be treated with zoledronic acid injection. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Pre-existing hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g., hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery; malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine) must be effectively treated before initiating therapy with zoledronic acid injection. Clinical monitoring of calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) is highly recommended for these patients [see Contraindications (4) ]. Hypocalcemia following zoledronic acid injection administration is a significant risk in Paget's disease. All patients should be instructed about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in maintaining serum calcium levels [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Information for Patients (17) ]. 5.3 Renal Impairment A single dose of zoledronic acid injection should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. Zoledronic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min and in those with evidence of acute renal impairment. [See Contraindications (4.2) ]. If history or physical signs suggest dehydration, zoledronic acid injection therapy should be withheld until normovolemic status has been achieved. [See Post-marketing Experience (6.2) ]. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal impairment. Acute renal impairment, including renal failure, has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise, advanced age, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, concomitant diuretic therapy, or severe dehydration occurring before or after zoledronic acid injection administration. Acute renal failure (ARF) has been observed in patients after a single administration. Rare reports of hospitalization and/or dialysis or fatal outcome occurred in patients with underlying moderate to severe renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described in this section [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2) ]. Renal impairment may lead to increased exposure of concomitant medications and/or their metabolites that are primarily renally excreted [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using Cockcroft-Gault formula before each zoledronic acid injection dose. Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function; interim monitoring of creatinine clearance should be performed in at-risk patients. Elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy are at increased risk of acute renal failure. These patients should have their fluid status assessed and be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Consider monitoring creatinine clearance in patients at-risk for ARF who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture occurs. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Pregnancy ZOLEDRONIC ACID INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on zoledronic acid injection therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.7 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Consider withholding future zoledronic acid injection treatment if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.8 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. Use zoledronic acid injection with caution in aspirin-sensitive patients."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of Zoledronic Acid Injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 4). Table 4 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of Zoledronic Acid Injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 5 and 6.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis, or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors.

Less common adverse events reported more often with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 10). Table 10: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Pamidronate 90 mg *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zoledronic Acid Injection to 15 minutes. n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 27/246 (11%) 23/246 (9%) Abnormal 2/26 (8%) 2/22 (9%) Total 29/272 (11%) 25/268 (9%) Solid Tumors Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 17/154 (11%) 10/143 (7%) Abnormal 1/11 (9%) 1/20 (5%) Total 18/165 (11%) 11/163 (7%) Prostate Cancer Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg Placebo n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 12/82 (15%) 8/68 (12%) Abnormal 4/10 (40%) 2/10 (20%) Total 16/92 (17%) 10/78 (13%) The risk of deterioration in renal function appeared to be related to time on study, whether patients were receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection (4 mg over 15 minutes), placebo, or pamidronate. In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial Zoledronic Acid Injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision ; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R). (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zoledronic Acid Injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zoledronic Acid Injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic Acid Injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic Acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zoledronic Acid Injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zoledronic Acid Injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic Acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zoledronic Acid Injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 µmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 µmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Zoledronic Acid Injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Zoledronic Acid Injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of Zoledronic Acid Injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use Zoledronic Acid Injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as Zoledronic Acid Injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic Acid Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and post-implantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60%-77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with Zoledronic Acid Injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in Zoledronic Acid Injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1-14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15-28). Coadministration of thalidomide with Zoledronic Acid Injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-625-1618 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of Zoledronic Acid Injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33-84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse reactions were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 4). Table 4 provides adverse reactions that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse reactions are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse reactions are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of Zoledronic Acid Injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 5 and 6.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24-48 hours. Ocular Adverse Reactions Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis, or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors.

Less common adverse reactions reported more often with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 10). Table 10: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zoledronic Acid Injection to 15 minutes.

In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial Zoledronic Acid Injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Reactions Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R). (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zoledronic Acid Injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zoledronic Acid Injection if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zoledronic Acid Injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic Acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zoledronic Acid Injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zoledronic Acid Injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic Acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zoledronic Acid Injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Zoledronic Acid Injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Zoledronic Acid Injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of Zoledronic Acid Injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use Zoledronic Acid Injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as Zoledronic Acid Injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic Acid Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to 77%. In-vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In-vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. ( 7.1 ) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with Zoledronic Acid Injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia. ( 7.2 ) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in Zoledronic Acid Injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when Zoledronic Acid Injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1-14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15-28). Coadministration of thalidomide with Zoledronic Acid Injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pharmaceutics International, Incorporated (Pii) at 410-584-0001 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of Zoledronic Acid Injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33 to 84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia and dyspnea. (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of Zoledronic Acid Injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24 to 48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis, or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2,042 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors. Table 6 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the Pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg /dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9). Table 9: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zoledronic Acid Injection to 15 minutes.

In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial Zoledronic Acid Injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zoledronic Acid Injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema, and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany, and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R). ( 5.1 ) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment. ( 5.2 ) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. ( 5.3 ) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zoledronic Acid Injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures. ( 5.4 ) Severe incapacitating bone, joint and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zoledronic Acid Injection if severe symptoms occur. ( 5.5 ) Zoledronic Acid Injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. ( 5.9 , 8.1 ) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. ( 5.6 ) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic Acid Injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection should not be treated with Reclast(R) or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zoledronic Acid Injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zoledronic Acid Injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic Acid Injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zoledronic Acid Injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic Acid Injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zoledronic Acid Injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic Acid Injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Zoledronic Acid Injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Zoledronic Acid Injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Zoledronic Acid Injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of Zoledronic Acid Injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use Zoledronic Acid Injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as Zoledronic Acid Injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic Acid Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and postimplantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with Zoledronic Acid Injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when Zoledronic Acid Injection is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating Zoledronic Acid Injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60%-77%. In vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods. (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with Zometa may increase risk of hypocalcemia. (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution. (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Calcitonin Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides or calcitonin, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in Zometa clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when Zometa is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when Zometa is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for Zometa 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, Zometa 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1-14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15-28). Coadministration of thalidomide with Zometa did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of Zometa was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either Zometa 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33-84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of Zometa 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when Zometa 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zometa should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 4). Table 4 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with Zometa 4 mg or pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with Zometa. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zometa administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of Zometa in patients with HCM are shown in Table 5 and 6.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24-48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including Zometa. No cases of iritis, scleritis, or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with Zometa 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for Zometa 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors. Table 7 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with Zometa 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the Zometa 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the Zometa 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving Zometa 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 10). Table 10: Percentage of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Renal Function Deterioration by Baseline Serum Creatinine* *Table includes only patients who were randomized to the trial after a protocol amendment that lengthened the infusion duration of Zometa to 15 minutes.

In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure, and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial Zometa dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of Zometa. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw but also of other anatomical sites including hip, femur and external auditory canal) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including Zometa. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Caution is advised when Zometa is administered with anti-angiogenic drugs as an increased incidence of ONJ has been observed with concomitant use of these drugs. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after Zometa administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including Zometa [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have been reported. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS: taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses: blurred vision; uveitis; Gastrointestinal: dry mouth; Skin: Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal: muscle cramps; Cardiovascular: hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive rechallenge; Renal: hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site: weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia (cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events including seizures, tetany, and numbness have been reported due to severe hypocalcemia)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with Zometa should not be treated with Reclast(R). (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of Zometa and monitor electrolytes during treatment. (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting Zometa. Avoid invasive dental procedures. (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue Zometa if severe symptoms occur. (5.5) Zometa can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating Zometa. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium closely with concomitant administration of other drugs known to cause hypocalcemia to avoid severe or life-threatening hypocalcemia (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zometa contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R) (zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with Zometa should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of Zometa. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with Zometa in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zometa should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with Zometa. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zometa is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of Zometa and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with Zometa. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zometa treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 µmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zometa treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 µmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with Zometa 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including Zometa. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Zometa. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including Zometa. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of Zometa therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with Zometa, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of Zometa to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use Zometa in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as Zometa, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zometa may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and post-implantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with Zometa. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Caution is advised when Zometa is administered with drugs known to cause hypocalcemia, as severe hypocalcemia may develop, [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Serum calcium should be measured and hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating Zometa. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In-vitro studies indicate that the plasma protein binding of zoledronic acid is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% to 77%. In-vitro studies also indicate that zoledronic acid does not inhibit microsomal CYP450 enzymes. In-vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May have an additive effect to lower serum calcium for prolonged periods (7.1) Loop diuretics: Concomitant use with zoledronic acid injection may increase risk of hypocalcemia (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution (7.3) 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid injection clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. 7.4 Thalidomide No dose adjustment for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is needed when coadministered with thalidomide. In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 patients with multiple myeloma, zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 15-minute infusion was administered either alone or with thalidomide (100 mg once daily on days 1-14 and 200 mg once daily on days 15-28). Coadministration of thalidomide with zoledronic acid injection did not significantly change the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid or creatinine clearance."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (greater than 25%) were nausea, fatigue, anemia, bone pain, constipation, fever, vomiting, and dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Vigilance & Medical Affairs at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety of zoledronic acid injection was studied in 185 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) who received either zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion (n=86) or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (n=103). The population was aged 33-84 years, 60% male and 81% Caucasian, with breast, lung, head and neck, and renal cancer as the most common forms of malignancy. NOTE: pamidronate 90 mg was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion. The relative safety of pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion compared to the same dose given as a 24-hour intravenous infusion has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials. Renal Toxicity Administration of zoledronic acid injection 4 mg given as a 5-minute intravenous infusion has been shown to result in an increased risk of renal toxicity, as measured by increases in serum creatinine, which can progress to renal failure. The incidence of renal toxicity and renal failure has been shown to be reduced when zoledronic acid injection 4 mg is given as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. Zoledronic acid injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. The most frequently observed adverse events were fever, nausea, constipation, anemia, and dyspnea (see Table 3). Table 3 provides adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of the 189 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg or Pamidronate 90 mg from the two HCM trials. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug: asthenia, chest pain, leg edema, mucositis, dysphagia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, nonspecific infection, hypocalcemia, dehydration, arthralgias, headache and somnolence. Rare cases of rash, pruritus, and chest pain have been reported following treatment with zoledronic acid injection. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported in patients, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness. These symptoms usually resolve within a few days. Pyrexia has been the most commonly associated symptom, occurring in 44% of patients. Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, can occur with bisphosphonate use. Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities for serum creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum magnesium observed in two clinical trials of zoledronic acid injection in patients with HCM are shown in Table 4 and 5.

In most cases, no specific treatment is required and the symptoms subside after 24-48 hours. Ocular Adverse Events Ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis can occur with bisphosphonate use, including zoledronic acid injection. No cases of iritis, scleritis or uveitis were reported during these clinical trials. However, cases have been seen in postmarketing use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Multiple Myeloma and Bone Metastases of Solid Tumors The safety analysis includes patients treated in the core and extension phases of the trials. The analysis includes the 2042 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg, pamidronate 90 mg, or placebo in the three controlled multicenter bone metastases trials, including 969 patients completing the efficacy phase of the trial, and 619 patients that continued in the safety extension phase. Only 347 patients completed the extension phases and were followed for 2 years (or 21 months for the other solid tumor patients). The median duration of exposure for safety analysis for zoledronic acid injection 4 mg (core plus extension phases) was 12.8 months for breast cancer and multiple myeloma, 10.8 months for prostate cancer, and 4.0 months for other solid tumors. Table 6 describes adverse events that were reported by 10% or more of patients. Adverse events are listed regardless of presumed causality to study drug.

Less common adverse events reported more often with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg than pamidronate included decreased weight, which was reported in 16% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group compared with 9% in the pamidronate group. Decreased appetite was reported in slightly more patients in the zoledronic acid injection 4 mg group (13%) compared with the pamidronate (9%) and placebo (10%) groups, but the clinical significance of these small differences is not clear. Renal Toxicity In the bone metastases trials, renal deterioration was defined as an increase of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (less than 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (greater than or equal to 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients receiving zoledronic acid injection 4 mg over 15 minutes in these trials (see Table 9).

The risk of deterioration in renal function appeared to be related to time on study, whether patients were receiving zoledronic acid injection (4 mg over 15 minutes), placebo, or pamidronate. In the trials and in postmarketing experience, renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have occurred in patients with normal and abnormal baseline renal function, including patients treated with 4 mg infused over a 15-minute period. There have been instances of this occurring after the initial zoledronic acid injection dose. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of zoledronic acid injection. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaws) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ. Data suggests a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Acute Phase Reaction Within three days after zoledronic acid injection administration, an acute phase reaction has been reported, with symptoms including pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness and arthritis with subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution could take up to 7 to 14 days. However, some of these symptoms have been reported to persist for a longer duration. Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported with bisphosphonate use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )]. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, and orbital inflammation including orbital edema have been reported during postmarketing use. In some cases, symptoms resolved with topical steroids. Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been rare reports of allergic reaction with intravenous zoledronic acid including angioedema, and bronchoconstriction. Very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock have also been reported. Additional adverse reactions reported in postmarketing use include: CNS : taste disturbance, hyperesthesia, tremor; Special Senses :blurred vision; Gastrointestinal :dry mouth; Skin :Increased sweating; Musculoskeletal :muscle cramps; Cardiovascular :hypertension, bradycardia, hypotension (associated with syncope or circulatory collapse primarily in patients with underlying risk factors); Respiratory: bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease (ILD) with positive re-challenge; Renal :hematuria, proteinuria; General Disorders and Administration Site :weight increase, influenza-like illness (pyrexia, asthenia, fatigue or malaise) persisting for greater than 30 days; Laboratory Abnormalities :hyperkalemia, hypernatremia."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast(R) (5.1) Adequately rehydrate patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection and monitor electrolytes during treatment (5.2) Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Do not use doses greater than 4 mg. Treatment in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Monitor serum creatinine before each dose (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Preventive dental exams should be performed before starting zoledronic acid injection. Avoid invasive dental procedures (5.4) Severe incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain may occur. Discontinue zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur (5.5) Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant (5.9, 8.1) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. Consider drug discontinuation in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture. (5.6) Hypocalcemia: Correct before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D (5.10) 5.1 Drugs with Same Active Ingredient or in the Same Drug Class Zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient as found in Reclast(R)(zoledronic acid). Patients being treated with zoledronic acid injection should not be treated with Reclast or other bisphosphonates. 5.2 Hydration and Electrolyte Monitoring Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy must be adequately rehydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Loop diuretics should not be used until the patient is adequately rehydrated and should be used with caution in combination with zoledronic acid injection in order to avoid hypocalcemia. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. Standard hypercalcemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and magnesium, as well as serum creatinine, should be carefully monitored following initiation of therapy with zoledronic acid injection. If hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia occur, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 5.3 Renal Impairment Zoledronic acid injection is excreted intact primarily via the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, in particular renal adverse reactions, may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Safety and pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment and the risk of renal deterioration is increased [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Preexisting renal insufficiency and multiple cycles of zoledronic acid injection and other bisphosphonates are risk factors for subsequent renal deterioration with zoledronic acid injection. Factors predisposing to renal deterioration, such as dehydration or the use of other nephrotoxic drugs, should be identified and managed, if possible. Zoledronic acid injection treatment in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with severe renal impairment should be considered only after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 400 μmol/L or greater than 4.5 mg/dL were excluded. Zoledronic acid injection treatment is not recommended in patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum creatinine greater than 265 μmol/L or greater than 3.0 mg/dL were excluded and there were only 8 of 564 patients treated with zoledronic acid injection 4 mg by 15-minute infusion with a baseline creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL. Limited pharmacokinetic data exists in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ based on tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Many reports of ONJ involved patients with signs of local infection including osteomyelitis. Cancer patients should maintain good oral hygiene and should have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates. While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.5 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including zoledronic acid injection. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated. Discontinuation of zoledronic acid injection therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy. 5.7 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Only limited clinical data are available for use of zoledronic acid injection to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with hepatic insufficiency, and these data are not adequate to provide guidance on dosage selection or how to safely use zoledronic acid injection in these patients. 5.9 Use in Pregnancy Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid injection, are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of weeks to years. There may be a risk of fetal harm (e.g., skeletal and other abnormalities) if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in pregnant rats, subcutaneous doses equivalent to 2.4 or 4.8 times the human systemic exposure resulted in pre- and post-implantation losses, decreases in viable fetuses and fetal skeletal, visceral, and external malformations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.10 Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with zoledronic acid injection. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic adverse events (seizures, tetany, and numbness) have been reported secondary to cases of severe hypocalcemia. In some instances, hypocalcemia may be life-threatening. Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating zoledronic acid injection. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed for zoledronic acid injection. In vitro and ex vivo studies showed low affinity of zoledronic acid for the cellular components of human blood. In vitro mean zoledronic acid protein binding in human plasma ranged from 28% at 200 ng/mL to 53% at 50 ng/mL. In vivo studies showed that zoledronic acid is not metabolized, and is excreted into the urine as the intact drug. Aminoglycosides: May lower serum calcium for prolonged periods (7.1) Loop diuretics: May increase risk of hypocalcemia (7.2) Nephrotoxic drugs: Use with caution (7.3) Drugs primarily excreted by the kidney: Exposure may be increased with renal impairment. Monitor serum creatinine in patients at risk (7.4) 7.1 Aminoglycosides Caution is advised when bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, are administered with aminoglycosides, since these agents may have an additive effect to lower serum calcium level for prolonged periods. This effect has not been reported in zoledronic acid clinical trials. 7.2 Loop Diuretics Caution should also be exercised when zoledronic acid injection is used in combination with loop diuretics due to an increased risk of hypocalcemia. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Caution is indicated when zoledronic acid injection is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 7.4 Drugs Primarily Excreted by the Kidney Renal impairment has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or other risk factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. In patients with renal impairment, the exposure to concomitant medications that are primarily renally excreted (e.g., digoxin) may increase. Consider monitoring serum creatinine in patients at risk for renal impairment who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) were pyrexia, myalgia, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity (6.1) Other important adverse reactions were flu-like illness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (6.2), and eye inflammation (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. REDDY'S LABORATORIES Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Paget's Disease of Bone In the Paget's disease trials, two 6-month, double-blind, comparative, multinational studies of 349 men and women aged greater than 30 years with moderate to severe disease and with confirmed Paget's disease of bone, 177 patients were exposed to zoledronic acid injection and 172 patients exposed to risedronate. Zoledronic acid injection was administered once as a single 5 mg dose in 100 mL solution infused over at least 15 minutes. Risedronate was given as an oral daily dose of 30 mg for 2 months. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5.1% in the zoledronic acid injection group and 6.4% in the risedronate group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 1.7% and 1.2% for the zoledronic acid injection and risedronate groups, respectively. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of the Paget's patients receiving zoledronic acid injection (single 5 mg intravenous infusion) or risedronate (30 mg oral daily dose for 2 months) over a 6-month study period are listed by system organ class in Table 1. Table 1.

Approximately 21% of patients had serum calcium levels less than 8.4 mg/dL 9 to 11 days following zoledronic acid injection administration. Renal Impairment In clinical trials in Paget's disease there were no cases of renal deterioration following a single 5 mg 15-minute infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Acute Phase Reaction The signs and symptoms of acute phase reaction (influenza-like illness, pyrexia, myalgia, arthralgia, and bone pain) were reported in 25% of patients in the zoledronic acid injection-treated group compared to 8% in the risedronate-treated group. Symptoms usually occur within the first 3 days following zoledronic acid injection administration. The majority of these symptoms resolved within 4 days of onset. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported with zoledronic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of zoledronic acid injection: Acute Phase Reactions Fever, headache, flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgia, and myalgia. Symptoms may be significant and lead to dehydration. Acute Renal Failure Acute renal failure requiring hospitalization and/or dialysis or with a fatal outcome have been rarely reported.Increased serum creatinine was reported in patients with 1) underlying renal disease, 2) dehydration secondary to fever, sepsis, gastrointestinal losses, or diuretic therapy, or 3) other risk factors such as advanced age, or concomitant nephrotoxic drugs in the post-infusion period. Transient rise in serum creatinine can be correctable with intravenous fluids. Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions with intravenous zoledronic acid including anaphylactic reaction/shock, urticaria, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic edpidermal necrolysis, and bronchoconstriction have been reported. Asthma Exacerbations Asthma exacerbations have been reported. Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. Ocular Adverse Events Cases of the following events have been reported: conjunctivitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, uveitis, episcleritis, scleritis, and orbital inflammation/edema. Other Hypotension in patients with underlying risk factors have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Products Containing Same Active Ingredient: Patients receiving Zometa should not receive zoledronic acid injection (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Patients must be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (5.2) Renal Impairment: A single dose should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes. Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with underlying renal impairment or with other risk factors, including advanced age or dehydration. Monitor creatinine clearance before each dose (2.7, 5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported. All patients should have a routine oral exam by the prescriber prior to treatment (5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture (5.5). Pregnancy: Zoledronic acid injection can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should be advised (5.6, 8.1) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Withhold future doses of zoledronic acid injection if severe symptoms occur (5.7) 5.1 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient Zoledronic acid injection contains the same active ingredient found in Zometa, used for oncology indications, and a patient being treated with Zometa should not be treated with zoledronic acid injection. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Pre-existing hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g., hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery; malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine) must be effectively treated before initiating therapy with zoledronic acid injection. Clinical monitoring of calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) is highly recommended for these patients [see Contraindications (4) ]. Hypocalcemia following zoledronic acid injection administration is a significant risk in Paget's disease. All patients should be instructed about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in maintaining serum calcium levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Information for Patients (17) ]. 5.3 Renal Impairment A single dose of zoledronic acid injection should not exceed 5 mg and the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 minutes [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. Zoledronic acid injection is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min and in those with evidence of acute renal impairment. [See Contraindications (4) ]. If history or physical signs suggest dehydration, zoledronic acid injection therapy should be withheld until normovolemic status has been achieved. [See Post-marketing Experience (6.2) ]. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal impairment. Acute renal impairment, including renal failure, has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise, advanced age, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, concomitant diuretic therapy, or severe dehydration occurring before or after zoledronic acid injection administration. Acute renal failure (ARF) has been observed in patients after a single administration. Rare reports of hospitalization and/or dialysis or fatal outcome occurred in patients with underlying moderate to severe renal impairment or with any of the risk factors described in this section [see Post-Marketing Experience (6.2) ]. Renal impairment may lead to increased exposure of concomitant medications and/or their metabolites that are primarily renally excreted [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using Cockcroft-Gault formula before each zoledronic acid injection dose. Transient increase in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function; interim monitoring of creatinine clearance should be performed in at-risk patients. Elderly patients and those receiving diuretic therapy are at increased risk of acute renal failure. These patients should have their fluid status assessed and be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection. Zoledronic acid injection should be used with caution with other nephrotoxic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Consider monitoring creatinine clearance in patients at-risk for ARF who are taking concomitant medications that are primarily excreted by the kidney [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ. While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture occurs. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Pregnancy ZOLEDRONIC ACID INJECTION SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING PREGNANCY. Zoledronic acid injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on zoledronic acid injection therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.7 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid injection. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Consider withholding future zoledronic acid injection treatment if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.8 Patients with Asthma While not observed in clinical trials with zoledronic acid injection, there have been reports of bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive patients receiving bisphosphonates. Use zoledronic acid injection with caution in aspirin-sensitive patients."
