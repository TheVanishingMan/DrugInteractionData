        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Inhibition of 11ß-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses (7.1) -Glucocorticoid Replacement: Should be carefully adjusted (7.2) -Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin (7.3) -Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women (7.4) -Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents: May require adjustment (7.5) 7.1 Inhibition of 11ß-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (11ßHSD-1) The microsomal enzyme 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. GH and somatropin inhibit 11βHSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GHD have relative increases in 11βHSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11ßHSD-1. 7.2 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement dosing should be carefully adjusted in children receiving concomitant somatropin and glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. 7.3 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CYP450)- mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.4 Oral Estrogen Because oral estrogens may reduce the serum IGF-1 response to somatropin treatment, girls and women receiving oral estrogen replacement may require greater somatropin dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 7.5 Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral/injectable agent may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Other common somatropin-related adverse reactions include injection site reactions/rashes and lipoatrophy (6.1) and headaches (6.3). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk at 1-888-NOVO-444 (1-888-668-6444) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Most Serious and/or Most Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions This list presents the most seriousb and/or most frequently observeda adverse reactions during treatment with somatropin: - bSudden death in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome with risk factors including severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea and unidentified respiratory infection [see Contraindications (4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] - bIntracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, in teenagers/young adults treated with radiation to the head as children for a first neoplasm and somatropin [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] - a,bGlucose intolerance including impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose as well as overt diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] - bIntracranial hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] - bSignificant diabetic retinopathy [see Contraindications (4.4) ] - bSlipped capital femoral epiphysis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] - bProgression of preexisting scoliosis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] - aFluid retention manifested by edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paraesthesias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] - aUnmasking of latent central hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] - aInjection site reactions/rashes and lipoatrophy (as well as rare generalized hypersensitivity reactions) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] -Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin formulation cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with a second somatropin formulation, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Children with Noonan Syndrome Norditropin was studied in a two-year prospective, randomized, parallel dose group trial in 21 children, 3-14 years old, with Noonan syndrome. Doses were 0.033 and 0.066 mg/kg/day. After the initial two-year randomized trial, children continued Norditropin treatment until final height was achieved; randomized dose groups were not maintained. Final height and adverse event data were later collected retrospectively from 18 children; total follow-up was 11 years. An additional 6 children were not randomized, but followed the protocol and are included in this assessment of adverse events. Based on the mean dose per treatment group, no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events was seen between the two groups. The most frequent adverse events were the common infections of childhood, including upper respiratory infection, gastroenteritis, ear infection, and influenza. Cardiac disorders was the system organ class with the second most adverse events reported. However, congenital heart disease is an inherent component of Noonan syndrome, and there was no evidence of somatropin-induced ventricular hypertrophy or exacerbation of preexisting ventricular hypertrophy (as judged by echocardiography) during this study. Children who had baseline cardiac disease judged to be significant enough to potentially affect growth were excluded from the study; therefore the safety of Norditropin in children with Noonan syndrome and significant cardiac disease is not known. Among children who received 0.033 mg/kg/day, there was one adverse event of scoliosis; among children who received 0.066 mg/kg/day, there were four adverse events of scoliosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Mean serum IGF-I standard deviation score (SDS) levels did not exceed +1 in response to somatropin treatment. The mean serum IGF-I level was low at baseline and normalized during treatment. Clinical Trials in Children with Turner Syndrome In two clinical studies wherein children with Turner syndrome were treated until final height with various doses of Norditropin as described in Clinical Studies (14.2) , the most frequently reported adverse events were common childhood diseases including influenza-like illness, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis externa, gastroenteritis and eczema. Otitis media adverse events in Study 1 were most frequent in the highest dose groups (86.4% in the 0.045-0.067-0.089 mg/kg/day group vs. 78.3% in the 0.045-0.067 mg/kg/day group vs. 69.6% in the 0.045 mg/kg/day group) suggesting a possible dose-response relationship. Of note, approximately 40-50% of these otitis media adverse events were designated as "serious" [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. No patients in either study developed clearcut overt diabetes mellitus; however, in Study 1, impaired fasting glucose at Month 48 was more frequent in patients in the 0.045-0.067 mg/kg/day group (n=4/18) compared with the 0.045 mg/kg/day group (n=1/20). Transient episodes of fasting blood sugars between 100 and 126 mg/dL, and, on occasion, exceeding 126 mg/dL also occurred more often with larger doses of Norditropin in both studies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Three patients withdrew from the 2 high dose groups in Study 1 because of concern about excessive growth of hands or feet. In addition, in Study 1, exacerbation of preexisting scoliosis was designated a serious adverse reaction in two patients in the 0.045 mg/kg/day group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Clinical Trials in Children Born Small for Gestational Age (SGA) with No Catch-up Growth by Age 2-4 Years Study 1 (Long-Term) In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind study, 53 non-GHD children with short stature born SGA with failure to catch-up were treated with 2 doses of Norditropin (0.033 or 0.067 mg/kg/day) to final height for up to 13 years (mean duration of treatment 7.9 and 9.5 years for girls and boys, respectively). The most frequently reported adverse events were common childhood diseases including influenza-like illness, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, otitis media, pharyngitis, arthralgia, and headache. Adverse events possibly/probably related to Norditropin were otitis media, arthralgia, headaches (no confirmed diagnoses of benign intracranial hypertension), gynecomastia, and increased sweating. One child treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day for 4 years was reported with disproportionate growth of the lower jaw, and another child treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day developed a melanocytic nevus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. There were no clear cut reports of exacerbation of preexisting scoliosis or slipped capital femoral epiphysis. No apparent differences between the treatment groups were observed. In addition, the timing of puberty was age-appropriate in boys and girls in both treatment groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that no novel adverse events potentially related to treatment with Norditropin were reported in long-term Study 1. Study 2 (Short-Term) In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, 98 Japanese non-GHD children with short stature born SGA with failure to catch-up were treated with 2 doses of Norditropin (0.033 or 0.067 mg/kg/day) for 2 years or were untreated for 1 year. The most frequently reported adverse events were common childhood diseases almost identical to those reported above for Study 1. Adverse events possibly/probably related to Norditropin were otitis media, arthralgia and impaired glucose tolerance. No apparent differences between the treatment groups were observed. However, arthralgia and transiently impaired glucose tolerance were only reported in the 0.067 mg/kg/day treatment group. Therefore, it can also be concluded that no novel adverse events potentially related to treatment with rhGH were reported in short-term Study 2. As with all protein drugs, some patients may develop antibodies to the protein. Eighteen of the 76 children (~24%) treated with Norditropin developed anti-rhGH antibodies. However, these antibodies did not appear to be neutralizing in that the change from baseline in height SDS at Year 2 was similar in antibody positive and antibody negative children by treatment group. In both Study 1 and Study 2, there were no clear cut cases of new onset diabetes mellitus, no children treated for hyperglycemia, and no adverse event withdrawals due to abnormalities in glucose tolerance. In Study 2, after treatment with either dose of Norditropin for 2 years, there were no children with consecutive fasting blood glucose levels between 100 and 126 mg/dL, or with fasting blood glucose levels > 126 mg/dL. Furthermore, mean hemoglobin A1c levels tended to decrease during long-term treatment in Study 1, and remained normal in Study 2. However, in Study 1, 4 children treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day of Norditropin and 2 children treated with 0.033 mg/kg/day of Norditropin shifted from normal fasting blood glucose levels at baseline to increased levels after 1 year of treatment (100 to 126 mg/dL or > 126 mg/dL). In addition, small increases in mean fasting blood glucose and insulin levels (within the normal reference range) after 1 and 2 years of Norditropin treatment appeared to be dose-dependent [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In both Study 1 and Study 2, there was no acceleration of bone maturation. A dose-dependent increase in mean serum IGF-I SDS levels within the reference range (but including a substantial number of children with serum IGF-1 SDS > +2) was observed after both long-term (Study 1) and short-term (Study 2) Norditropin treatment. Clinical Trials in Adult GHD Patients Adverse events with an incidence of >=5% occurring in patients with AO GHD during the 6 month placebo-controlled portion of the largest of the six adult GHD Norditropin trials are presented in Table 1. Peripheral edema, other types of edema, arthralgia, myalgia, and paraesthesia were common in the Norditropin-treated patients, and reported much more frequently than in the placebo group. These types of adverse events are thought to be related to the fluid accumulating effects of somatropin. In general, these adverse events were mild and transient in nature. During the placebo-controlled portion of this study, approximately 5% of patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus treated with Norditropin were diagnosed with overt type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with none in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Anti-GH antibodies were not detected. Of note, the doses of Norditropin employed during this study (completed in the mid 1990s) were substantially larger than those currently recommended by the Growth Hormone Research Society, and, more than likely, resulted in a greater than expected incidence of fluid retention- and glucose intolerance-related adverse events. A similar incidence and pattern of adverse events were observed during the other three placebo-controlled AO GHD trials and during the two placebo-controlled CO GHD trials. Table 1 - Adverse Reactions with >=5% Overall Incidence in Adult Onset Growth Hormone Deficient Patients Treated with Norditropin During a Six Month Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial Norditropin (N=53) Placebo (N=52) Adverse Reactions n % n % Peripheral Edema 22 42 4 8 Edema 13 25 0 0 Arthralgia 10 19 8 15 Leg Edema 8 15 2 4 Myalgia 8 15 4 8 Infection (non-viral) 7 13 4 8 Paraesthesia 6 11 3 6 Skeletal Pain 6 11 1 2 Headache 5 9 3 6 Bronchitis 5 9 0 0 Flu-like symptoms 4 8 2 4 Hypertension 4 8 1 2 Gastroenteritis 4 8 4 8 Other Non-Classifiable Disorders (excludes accidental injury) 4 8 3 6 Increased sweating 4 8 1 2 Glucose tolerance abnormal 3 6 1 2 Laryngitis 3 6 3 6 The adverse event pattern observed during the open label phase of the study was similar to the one presented above. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Norditropin with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In the case of growth hormone, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/mL have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/mL, interference with the growth response was observed. In clinical trials, GHD pediatric patients receiving Norditropin for up to 12 months were tested for induction of antibodies, and 0/358 patients developed antibodies with binding capacities above 2 mg/L. Amongst these patients, 165 had previously been treated with other somatropin formulations, and 193 were previously untreated naive patients. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The adverse events reported during post-marketing surveillance do not differ from those listed/discussed above in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 in children and adults. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GH deficient children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of leukemia are related to GH therapy, the pathology of GHD itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy per se was responsible for these cases of leukemia. The risk for children with GHD, if any, remains to be established [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The following additional adverse reactions have been observed during the appropriate use of somatropin: headaches (children and adults), gynecomastia (children), and pancreatitis (children and adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]). New-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Acute Critical Illness: Potential benefit of treatment continuation should be weighed against the potential risk (5.1) -Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment for GHD. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur (5.2) -Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin - in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm (5.3) -Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: May be unmasked. Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may require adjustment (5.4) -Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema. May develop and is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction (5.5) -Fluid Retention (i.e., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome - especially in adults): May occur frequently. Reduce dose as necessary (5.6) -Hypothyroidism: May first become evident or worsen (5.7) -Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: May develop. Evaluate children with the onset of a limp or hip/knee pain (5.8) -Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis: May develop (5.9) -Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain. (5.14) 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4.1) ]. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients experiencing acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Norditropin is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome. 5.3 Neoplasms In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent GHD and were treated with somatropin, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence [see Contraindications (4.3)]. Monitor all patients with a history of GHD secondary to an intracranial neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor. Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients. If treatment with somatropin is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked during somatropin treatment. New onset type 2 Diabetes Mellitus has been reported in patients. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (i.e., insulin or oral/injectable agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.7 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GHD, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. In patients with hypopituitarism (multiple hormone deficiencies), standard hormonal replacement therapy should be monitored closely when somatropin therapy is administered. 5.8 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GHD and Turner syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy should be carefully evaluated. 5.9 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated patients with Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy. 5.10 Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Turner Syndrome Patients with Turner syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders since these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with Turner syndrome. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders (e.g., stroke, aortic aneurysm/dissection, hypertension) as these patients are also at risk for these conditions. 5.11 Confirmation of Childhood Onset Adult GHD Patients with epiphyseal closure who were treated with somatropin replacement therapy in childhood should be reevaluated according to the criteria in Indications and Usage (1.2) before continuation of somatropin therapy at the reduced dose level recommended for GH deficient adults. 5.12 Local and Systemic Reactions When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. As with any protein, local or systemic allergic reactions may occur. Parents/Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 5.13 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IGF-I may increase after somatropin therapy. 5.14 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated patient, especially a child, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibition of 11 β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses (7.1, 7.2). Glucocorticoid replacement: Should be carefully adjusted (7.2). Cytochrome P450 - Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin (7.3). Oral estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women (7.4). Insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents: May require adjustment (7.5). 7.1 11 β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (11βHSD-1) The microsomal enzyme 11βHSD-1 is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. Growth hormone (GH) and somatropin inhibit 11βHSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11βHSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1. 7.2 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth-promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement therapy should be carefully adjusted in children with concomitant GH and glucocorticoid deficiency to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. The use of Nutropin AQ in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) requiring glucocorticoid therapy has not been evaluated. Concomitant glucocorticoid therapy may inhibit the growth promoting effect of Nutropin AQ. Therefore, if glucocorticoid replacement is required for CKD, the glucocorticoid dose should be carefully adjusted to avoid an inhibitory effect on growth. In the clinical trials there was no evidence of drug interactions with Nutropin and commonly used drugs used in the management of CKD. 7.3 Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-Metabolized Drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases CYP450-mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.4 Oral Estrogen Because oral estrogens may reduce insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) response to somatropin treatment, girls and women receiving oral estrogen replacement may require greater somatropin dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 7.5 Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral/injectable hypoglycemic agents may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]."

Additional common adverse reactions in adults include edema, arthralgias, and carpal tunnel syndrome (6.1, 6.2). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Most Serious and/or Most Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions This list presents the most seriousa and/or most frequently observedb adverse reactions during treatment with somatropin: a Sudden death in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) with risk factors including severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea and unidentified respiratory infection [see Contraindications (4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. a Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, in teenagers/young adults treated with radiation to the head as children for a first neoplasm and somatropin [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. aPancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)] a,b Glucose intolerance including impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose as well as overt diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. a Intracranial hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. a Significant diabetic retinopathy [see Contraindications (4.4)]. a Slipped capital femoral epiphysis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. a Progression of preexisting scoliosis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. b Fluid retention manifested by edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paraesthesias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. a Unmasking of latent central hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. a Injection site reactions/rashes and lipoatrophy (as well as rare generalized hypersensitivity reactions) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin formulation cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with a second somatropin formulation, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice. Pediatric Patients Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Injection site discomfort has been reported. This is more commonly observed in children switched from another somatropin product to Nutropin AQ. Turner Syndrome In a randomized, controlled trial, there was a statistically significant increase, as compared to untreated controls, in otitis media (43% vs. 26%) and ear disorders (18% vs. 5%) in patients receiving somatropin. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) In a post-marketing surveillance study, the National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS), the pattern of adverse events in over 8,000 patients with ISS was consistent with the known safety profile of growth hormone (GH), and no new safety signals attributable to GH were identified. The frequency of protocol-defined targeted adverse events is described in the table, below. Table 1 Protocol-Defined Targeted Adverse Events in the ISS NCGS Cohort Reported Events NCGS (N = 8018) AVN = avascular necrosis; SCFE = slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Data obtained with several rhGH products (Nutropin, Nutropin AQ, Nutropin Depot and Protropin). Any Adverse Event Overall 103 (1.3%) Targeted Adverse Event Overall 103 (1.3%) Injection-site reaction 28 (0.3%) New onset or progression of scoliosis 16 (0.2%) Gynecomastia 12 (0.1%) Any new onset or recurring tumor (benign) 12 (0.1%) Arthralgia or arthritis 10 (0.1%) Diabetes mellitus 5 (0.1%) Edema 5 (0.1%) Cancer, neoplasm (new onset or recurrence) 4 (0.0%) Fracture 4 (0.0%) Intracranial hypertension 4 (0.0%) Abnormal bone or other growth 3 (0.0%) Central nervous system tumor 2 (0.0%) New or recurrent SCFE or AVN 2 (0.0%) Carpal tunnel syndrome 1 (0.0%) In subjects treated in a long-term study of Nutropin for ISS, mean fasting and postprandial insulin levels increased, while mean fasting and postprandial glucose levels remained unchanged. Mean hemoglobin A1c (A1C) levels rose slightly from baseline as expected during adolescence; sporadic values outside normal limits occurred transiently. Adult Patients Growth Hormone Deficiency In clinical studies with Nutropin AQ in GHD adults, edema or peripheral edema was reported in 41% of GH-treated patients and 25% of placebo-treated patients. In GHD adults, arthralgias and other joint disorders were reported in 27% of GH-treated patients and 15% of placebo-treated patients. Nutropin therapy in adults with GHD of adult-onset was associated with an increase of median fasting insulin level in the Nutropin 0.0125 mg/kg/day group from 9.0 µU/mL at baseline to 13.0 µU/mL at Month 12 with a return to the baseline median level after a 3-week post-washout period of GH therapy. In the placebo group there was no change from 8.0 µU/mL at baseline to Month 12, and after the post-washout period, the median level was 9.0 µU/mL. The between-treatment group difference on the change from baseline to Month 12 in median fasting insulin level was significant, p < 0.0001. In childhood-onset subjects, there was an increase of median fasting insulin level in the Nutropin 0.025 mg/kg/day group from 11.0 µU/mL at baseline to 20.0 µU/mL at Month 12, in the Nutropin 0.0125 mg/kg/day group from 8.5 µU/mL to 11.0 µU/mL, and in the placebo group from 7.0 µU/mL to 8.0 µU/mL. The between-treatment group differences for these changes were significant, p = 0.0007. In subjects with adult-onset GHD, there were no between-treatment group differences on change from baseline to Month 12 in mean A1C level, p = 0.08. In childhood-onset GHD, the mean A1C level increased in the Nutropin 0.025 mg/kg/day group from 5.2% at baseline to 5.5% at Month 12, and did not change in the Nutropin 0.0125 mg/kg/day group from 5.1% at baseline or in the placebo group from 5.3% at baseline. The between-treatment group differences were significant, p = 0.009. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The adverse events reported during post-marketing surveillance do not differ from those listed/discussed above in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 in children and adults. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GHD children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of leukemia are related to GH therapy, the pathology of GHD itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy per se was responsible for these cases of leukemia. The risk for children with GHD, CKD, or TS, if any, remains to be established [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in GH-treated patients: gynecomastia (children), and pancreatitis [(Children and adults, see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. 6.4 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Nutropin with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In the case of GH, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/L have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/L, interference with the growth response was observed. In clinical studies of pediatric patients that were treated with Nutropin for the first time, 0/107 GHD patients, 0/125 CKD patients, 0/112 TS, and 0/117 ISS patients screened for antibody production developed antibodies with binding capacities >= 2 mg/L at six months. In a clinical study of patients that were treated with Nutropin AQ for the first time, 0/38 GHD patients screened for antibody production for up to 15 months developed antibodies with binding capacities >= 2 mg/L. Additional short-term immunologic and renal function studies were carried out in a group of pediatric patients with CKD after approximately one year of treatment to detect other potential adverse effects of antibodies to GH. Testing included measurements of C1q, C3, C4, rheumatoid factor, creatinine, creatinine clearance, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). No adverse effects of GH antibodies were noted."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute critical illness: Evaluate potential benefit of treatment continuation against potential risk (5.1). PWS: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiating therapy. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur. (5.2). Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or reoccurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin - in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm. (5.3). Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients, as IGT and DM may be unmasked during somatropin therapy. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in patients with DM may require adjustment. (5.4). Intracranial hypertension (IH): Exclude preexisting papilledema. IH may develop, but is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction (5.5). Fluid retention (e.g., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome- especially in adults): Reduce dose as necessary if such signs develop (5.6). Hypopituitarism: Closely monitor other hormone replacement therapies (5.7). Hypothyroidism: Monitor thyroid function periodically as it may first become evident or worsen after initiation of somatropin (5.8). Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE): Evaluate any child with onset of a limp or hip/knee pain for possible SCFE (5.9). Progression of preexisting scoliosis: Monitor any child with scoliosis for progression of the curve (5.10). Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain (5.15) 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illnesses due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4.1)]. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients having acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with PWS syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with PWS treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Nutropin AQ is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed PWS. 5.3 Neoplasms In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent GHD and were treated with somatropin, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence [see Contraindications (4.3)]. Monitor all patients with a history of GHD secondary to an intracranial neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor. Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients. If treatment with somatropin is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked during somatropin treatment, and new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity, Turner syndrome (TS), or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or IGT should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (i.e. insulin or oral/injectable agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial Hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with TS, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and PWS may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.7 Hypopituitarism Patients with hypopituitarism (multiple hormone deficiencies) should have their other hormonal replacement treatments closely monitored during somatropin treatment. 5.8 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with TS have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GHD, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.9 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) in Pediatric Patients SCFE may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GHD and TS) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy should be carefully evaluated. 5.10 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated TS patients. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with PWS. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy. 5.11 Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Patients with Turner Syndrome Patients with TS should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders, as these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with TS. In addition, patients with TS should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders (e.g., hypertension, aortic aneurysm or dissection, stroke) as these patients are also at increased risk for these conditions. 5.12 Chronic Kidney Disease in Pediatric Patients Children with growth failure secondary to CKD should be examined periodically for evidence of progression of renal osteodystrophy. SCFE or avascular necrosis of the femoral head may be seen in children with advanced renal osteodystrophy, and it is uncertain whether these problems are affected by somatropin therapy. X-rays of the hip should be obtained prior to initiating somatropin therapy in CKD patients and physicians and parents should be alert to the development of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain in these patients treated with Nutropin AQ. No studies have been completed evaluating Nutropin AQ therapy in patients who have received renal transplants. Currently, treatment of patients with functioning renal allografts is not indicated. 5.13 Local and Systemic Reactions When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. As with any protein, local or systemic allergic reactions may occur. Parents/patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 5.14 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone (PTH), and IGF-1 may increase during somatropin therapy. 5.15 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have TS may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated patient, especially a child, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses (7.1, 7.2). -Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment: Should be carefully adjusted (7.2) -Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin (7.3) -Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women (7.4) -Insulin and/or Oral Hypoglycemic Agents: May require adjustment (7.5) 7.1 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (11βHSD-1) The microsomal enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. GH and somatropin inhibit 11βHSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11βHSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1. 7.2 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement dosing should be carefully adjusted in children receiving concomitant somatropin and glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. 7.3 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.4 Oral Estrogen In adult women on oral estrogen replacement, a larger dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the defined treatment goal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 7.5 Insulin and/or Oral Hypoglycemic Agents In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral agent may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]."

Clinical Trials in Children with SGA In clinical studies of 273 pediatric patients born small for gestational age treated with another somatropin product, the following clinically significant events were reported: mild transient hyperglycemia, one patient with benign intracranial hypertension, two patients with central precocious puberty, two patients with jaw prominence, and several patients with aggravation of preexisting scoliosis, injection site reactions, and self-limited progression of pigmented nevi. Clinical Trials in Children with Idiopathic Short Stature In two open-label clinical studies conducted with another somatropin product in pediatric patients with ISS, the most commonly encountered adverse events were upper respiratory tract infections, influenza, tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, headaches, increased appetite, pyrexia, fracture, altered mood, and arthralgia. In one of the two studies during treatment with this other somatropin product, the mean IGF-1 standard deviation (SD) scores were maintained in the normal range. IGF-1 SD scores above +2 SD were observed as follows: 1 subject (3%), 10 subjects (30%) and 16 subjects (38%) in the untreated control, 0.23 and the 0.47 mg/kg/week groups respectively, had at least one measurement; while 0 subjects (0%), 2 subjects (7%) and 6 subjects (14%) had two or more consecutive IGF-1 measurements above +2 SD. Clinical Trials in Children with Turner Syndrome In two clinical studies with another somatropin product in pediatric patients with Turner syndrome, the most frequently reported adverse events were respiratory illnesses (influenza, tonsillitis, otitis, sinusitis), joint pain, and urinary tract infection. The only treatment-related adverse event that occurred in more than 1 patient was joint pain. Clinical Trials in Adults with GHD In clinical trials with another somatropin product in 1,145 GHD adults, the majority of the adverse events consisted of mild to moderate symptoms of fluid retention, including peripheral swelling, arthralgia, pain and stiffness of the extremities, peripheral edema, myalgia, paresthesia, and hypoesthesia. These events were reported early during therapy, and tended to be transient and/or responsive to dosage reduction. Table 3 displays the adverse events reported by 5% or more of adult GHD patients in clinical trials after various durations of treatment with another somatropin product.

All 12 patients had predisposing factors, e.g., elevated glycated hemoglobin levels and/or marked obesity, prior to receiving this other somatropin product. Of the 3,031 patients receiving this other somatropin product, 61 (2%) developed symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, which lessened after dosage reduction or treatment interruption (52) or surgery (9). Other adverse events that have been reported include generalized edema and hypoesthesia. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to OMNITROPE with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In the case of growth hormone, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/mL have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/mL, interference with the growth response was observed. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The adverse events reported during post-marketing surveillance do not differ from those listed/discussed above in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 in children and adults. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GH deficient children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of leukemia are related to GH therapy, the pathology of GHD itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy per se was responsible for these cases of leukemia. The risk for children with GHD, if any, remains to be established [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The following additional adverse reactions have been observed during the use of somatropin: headaches (children and adults), gynecomastia (children), and pancreatitis (children and adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. New-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported."

Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may require adjustment (5.4). -Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema.

Reduce dose as necessary (5.6). -Hypopituitarism: Closely monitor other hormone replacement therapies (5.7) -Hypothyroidism: May first become evident or worsen (5.8) -Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: May develop. Evaluate children with the onset of a limp or hip/knee pain (5.9) -Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis: May develop (5.10) -Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain (5.15) 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4.1)]. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients experiencing acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4.2)]. 5.3 Neoplasms In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent GHD and were treated with somatropin , an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas , were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence [see Contraindications ( 4.3 )] . Monitor all patients with a history of GHD secondary to an intracranial neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor. Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients. If treatment with somatropin is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked, and new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner Syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (i.e., insulin or oral agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients. [See Drug Interactions (7.5)] 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension (IH) Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi Syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.7 Hypopituitarism Patients with hypopituitarism (multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies) should have their other hormonal replacement treatments closely monitored during somatropin treatment. 5.8 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism and should have their thyroid function checked prior to initiation of somatropin therapy. In patients with GHD, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.9 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GHD and Turner syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy should be carefully evaluated. 5.10 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated Turner syndrome patients. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy. 5.11 Confirmation of Childhood Onset Adult GHD Patients with epiphyseal closure who were treated with somatropin replacement therapy in childhood should be reevaluated according to the criteria in Indications and Usage (1.2) before continuation of somatropin therapy at the reduced dose level recommended for GH deficient adults. 5.12 Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Turner Syndrome Patients with Turner syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders since these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with Turner syndrome. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders (e.g., stroke, aortic aneurysm/dissection, hypertension) as these patients are also at risk for these conditions. 5.13 Local and Systemic Reactions When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. As with any protein, local or systemic allergic reactions may occur. Parents/Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 5.14 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IGF-I may increase after somatropin therapy. 5.15 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin treated patient, especially a child, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain. 5.16 Benzyl Alcohol Benzyl alcohol, a component of Omnitrope(R) Cartridge 5 mg/1.5 mL and the diluent for Omnitrope(R) for injection 5.8 mg/vial, has been associated with serious adverse events and death, particularly in pediatric patients. The "gasping syndrome," (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. No data are available on drug interactions between Serostim(R) and HIV protease inhibitors or the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Inhibition of 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses (7.1) Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin (7.2) Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women (7.3) Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents: May require adjustment (7.4) 7.1 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 The microsomal enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. Somatropin inhibit 11βHSD-1. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1. 7.2 Cytochrome P450-metabolized drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Therefore, careful monitoring is advised when somatropin is administered in combination with drugs metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.3 Oral Estrogen Because oral estrogens may reduce the serum IGF-1 response to somatropin treatment, girls and women receiving oral estrogen replacement may require greater somatropin dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. 7.4 Insulin and/or Other Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents Patients with diabetes mellitus who receive concomitant treatment with somatropin may require adjustment of their doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions include (incidence >10%) tissue turgor (edema, myalgia, hypoesthesia) and musculoskeletal discomfort (arthralgia, pain in extremities) (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact EMD Serono at 1-800-283-8088 ext 5563 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical trials in HIV-associated wasting or cachexia: In the 12-week, placebo-controlled Clinical Trial 2, 510 patients were treated with Serostim(R). The most common adverse reactions judged to be associated with Serostim(R) were musculoskeletal discomfort and increased tissue turgor (swelling, particularly of the hands or feet), and were more frequently observed when Serostim(R) 0.1 mg/kg was administered on a daily basis [Table 1 and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. These symptoms often subsided with continued treatment or dose reduction. Approximately 23% of patients receiving Serostim(R) 0.1 mg/kg daily and 11% of patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg every other day required dose reductions. Discontinuations as a result of adverse reactions occurred in 10.3% of patients receiving Serostim(R) 0.1 mg/kg daily and 6.6% of patients receiving 0.1 mg/kg every other day. The most common reasons for dose reduction and/or drug discontinuation were arthralgia, myalgia, edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, elevated glucose levels, and elevated triglyceride levels. Clinical adverse reactions which occurred during the first 12 weeks of study in at least 5% of the patients in either active treatment group and at an incidence greater than placebo are listed below, without regard to causality assessment. Table 1: Controlled Clinical Trial 2 Adverse Reactions Occurring in at least 5% of Patients in one of the Treatment Groups, and at an Incidence Greater than Placebo Placebo 0.1 mg/kg every other day Serostim(R) 0.1 mg/kg daily Serostim(R) Patients (n=247) Patients (n=257) Patients (n=253) Body System Preferred Term % % % Musculoskeletal System Disorders Arthralgia 11.3 24.5 36.4 Myalgia 11.7 17.9 30.4 Arthrosis 3.6 7.8 10.7 Gastrointestinal System Disorders Nausea 4.9 5.4 9.1 Body As A Whole - General Disorders Edema Peripheral 2.8 11.3 26.1 Fatigue 4.5 3.5 5.1 Endocrine Disorders Gynecomastia 0.4 3.5 5.5 Central and Peripheral Nervous System Disorders Paresthesia 4.5 7.4 7.9 Hypoesthesia 2.4 1.6 5.1 Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders Edema Generalized 1.2 1.2 5.9 Adverse reactions that occurred in 1% to less than 5% of trial participants receiving Serostim(R) during the first 12 weeks of Clinical Trial 2 thought to be related to Serostim(R) included dose dependent edema, periorbital edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. During the 12-week, placebo-controlled portion of Clinical Trial 2, the incidence of hyperglycemia reported as an adverse reaction was 3.6% for the placebo group, 1.9% for the 0.1 mg/kg every other day group and 3.2% for the 0.1 mg/kg daily group. One case of diabetes mellitus was noted in the 0.1 mg/kg daily group during the first 12-weeks of therapy. In addition, during the extension phase of Clinical Trial 2, two patients converted from placebo to full dose Serostim(R), and 1 patient converted from placebo to half-dose Serostim(R), were discontinued because of the development of diabetes mellitus. The types and incidences of adverse reactions reported during the Clinical Trial 2 extension phase were not different from, or greater in frequency than those observed during the 12-week, placebo-controlled portion of Clinical Trial 2. Adverse reactions from treatment with Serostim (R) in clinical trials in HIV lipodystrophy Serostim(R) was evaluated for the treatment of patients with HIV lipodystrophy in two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that excluded patients with a history of diabetes, impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose (approximately 20% of the patients screened were excluded from study enrollment as a result of a diagnosis of diabetes or glucose intolerance). The studies included a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group \"induction\" phase followed by maintenance phases of different durations (12 and 24 weeks, respectively). In the initial 12-week treatment periods of the two, placebo-controlled clinical trials, 406 patients were treated with Serostim(R). Clinical adverse reactions which occurred during the first 12 weeks of both studies combined in at least 5% of the patients in either of the two active treatment groups are listed by treatment group in Table 2, without regard to causality assessment. The most common adverse reactions judged to be associated with Serostim(R) were edema, arthralgia, pain in extremity, hypoesthesia, myalgia, and blood glucose increased, all of which were more frequently observed when Serostim(R) 4 mg was administered on a daily basis compared with alternate days. These symptoms often subsided with dose reduction. During the 12-week induction phase, 1) approximately 26% of patients receiving Serostim(R) 4 mg daily and 19% of patients receiving Serostim(R) 4 mg every other day required dose reductions; and 2) discontinuations as a result of adverse reactions occurred in 13% of patients receiving Serostim(R) 4 mg daily and 5% of patients receiving Serostim(R) 4 mg every other day. The most common reasons for dose reduction and/or drug discontinuation were peripheral edema, hyperglycemia (including blood glucose increased, blood glucose abnormal, and hyperglycemia), and arthralgia.

Twenty-three patients discontinued due to hyperglycemia while receiving Serostim(R) during any phase of these studies (3.2% in the 12-week induction phases and 2.1% in the extension phases). Breast-Related Terms: When grouped together, breast-related adverse reactions (e.g. nipple pain, gynecomastia, breast pain/mass/tenderness/swelling/edema/hypertrophy) had an incidence of 1% for the placebo group, 3% for the Serostim(R) 4 mg every other day group and 6% for the Serostim(R) 4 mg daily group. Adverse reactions that occurred in 1% to less than 5% of trial participants receiving Serostim(R) during the first 12 weeks of HIV Lipodystrophy Studies 1 and 2 thought to be related to Serostim(R) include carpal tunnel syndrome, Tinel's sign and facial edema. The adverse reactions reported for Serostim(R) 4 mg every other day during the maintenance phase of HIV Lipodystrophy Study 1 (Week 12 to Week 24) were similar in frequency and quality to those observed after treatment with Serostim(R) 4 mg every other day during the 12-week induction phase. IGF-1 serum concentrations increased statistically in Serostim(R)-treated patients when compared to placebo (Table 3). In the Serostim(R) treated patients at baseline, the proportion of subjects with serum IGF-1 SDS levels >= +2 was approximately 10 to 20%, while with treatment with either dose regimen of Serostim(R) the percentage increased to 80 to 90% by Week 12.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influences by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Serostim(R) with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. After 12 weeks of treatment, none of the 651 study participants with HIV-associated wasting treated with Serostim(R) for the first time developed detectable antibodies to growth hormone (> 4 pg binding). Patients were not rechallenged. Data beyond 3 months is not available. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Serostim(R). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Endocrine: new onset impaired glucose tolerance new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus diabetic ketoacidosis diabetic coma In some patients, these conditions improved when Serostim(R) was discontinued, while in others the glucose intolerance persisted. Some of these patients required initiation or adjustment of antidiabetic treatment while on Serostim(R). Gastrointestinal-Pancreatitis. Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Concomitant Antiretroviral Therapy: In vitro experimental systems have demonstrated the potential to potentiate HIV replication. No significant somatropin-associated increase in viral load was observed in clinical trials. HIV patients should be maintained on antiretroviral therapy for the duration of Serostim(R) treatment (5.1) Impaired Glucose Tolerance/Diabetes: May be unmasked. Periodically monitor glucose levels. Dose adjustment of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may be required (5.2) Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema. May develop and is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction (5.3) Fluid Retention (edema, arthralgia)/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: May occur frequently. Reduce dose as necessary (5.4) Neoplasms: Monitor all patients with a history of any neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression, recurrence, or development of a tumor (5.6) Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain (5.7) 5.1 Concomitant Antiretroviral Therapy In some experimental systems, somatropin has been shown to potentiate HIV replication in vitro at concentrations ranging from 50-250 ng/mL. There was no increase in virus production when the antiretroviral agents, zidovudine, didanosine or lamivudine were added to the culture medium. Additional in vitro studies have shown that somatropin does not interfere with the antiviral activity of zalcitabine or stavudine. In the controlled clinical trials, no significant somatropin-associated increase in viral burden was observed. However, the protocol required all participants to be on concomitant antiretroviral therapy for the duration of the study. In view of the potential for acceleration of virus replication, it is recommended that HIV patients be maintained on antiretroviral therapy for the duration of Serostim(R) treatment. 5.2 Impaired Glucose Tolerance/Diabetes Hyperglycemia may occur in HIV infected individuals due to a variety of reasons. In wasting patients, treatment with Serostim(R) 0.1 mg/kg daily and 0.1 mg/kg every other day for 12 weeks was associated with approximately 10 mg/dL and 6 mg/dL increases in mean fasting blood glucose concentrations, respectively. The increases occurred early in treatment. Patients with other risk factors for glucose intolerance should be monitored closely during Serostim(R) therapy. During safety surveillance of patients with HIV-associated wasting, cases of new onset impaired glucose tolerance, new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus and exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus have been reported in patients receiving Serostim(R). Some patients developed diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetic coma. In some patients, these conditions improved when Serostim(R) was discontinued, while in others, the glucose intolerance persisted. Some of these patients required initiation or adjustment of antidiabetic treatment while on Serostim(R). In clinical trials of Serostim(R) conducted in HIV patients with lipodystrophy (an unapproved indication), evidence of dose-dependent glucose intolerance and related adverse reaction was observed at doses of 4 mg Serostim(R) daily and 4 mg Serostim(R) every other day for 12 weeks [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. 5.4 Fluid Retention/Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Increased tissue turgor (swelling, particularly in the hands and feet) and musculoskeletal discomfort (pain, swelling and/or stiffness) may occur during treatment with Serostim(R), but may resolve spontaneously, with analgesic therapy, or after reducing the frequency of dosing [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Carpal tunnel syndrome may occur during treatment with Serostim(R). If the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome do not resolve by decreasing the weekly number of doses of Serostim(R), it is recommended that treatment be discontinued. 5.5 Local and Systemic Reactions When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. As with any protein, local or systemic allergic reactions may occur. Patients should be informed that allergic reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 5.6 Neoplasms Because malignancies are more common in HIV positive individuals, the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in HIV positive patients should be carefully considered before initiating Serostim(R) treatment and patients should be monitored carefully for the development of neoplasms if treatment with somatropin is initiated. Monitor all patients with a history of any neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes of preexisting nevi. 5.7 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated patient, especially a child who develops abdominal pain."

        "Drug Interactions The microsomal enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. Growth hormone and somatropin inhibit 11βHSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11βHSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1. Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement dosing should be carefully adjusted in children receiving concomitant somatropin and glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450) mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes."

With respect to growth hormone, antibody binding capacities below 2 mg/L have not been associated with growth attenuation. In some cases, when binding capacity exceeds 2 mg/L, growth attenuation has been observed. None of the patients with anti-GH antibodies in the clinical studies experienced decreased linear growth response to ZOMACTON or any other associated adverse event. Injection site reactions (e.g., pain, bruise) occurred in 8 of the 164 treated patients. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of patients treated with other growth hormone products. It is uncertain whether this risk is related to the pathology of growth hormone deficiency itself, growth hormone therapy, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy for intracranial tumors. New-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibition of 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses. (7.1, 7.2) Glucocorticoid Replacement: Should be carefully adjusted. (7.2) Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin. (7.3) Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women. (7.4) Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents: May require adjustment (7.5) 7.1 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 The microsomal enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. GH and somatropin inhibit 11βHSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11βHSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1. 7.2 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement dosing should be carefully adjusted in children receiving concomitant somatropin and glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. 7.3 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Therefore, careful monitoring is advised when somatropin is administered in combination with drugs metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.4 Oral Estrogen Because oral estrogens may reduce the serum IGF-I response to somatropin treatment, girls and women receiving oral estrogen replacement may require greater somatropin dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 7.5 Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents Patients with diabetes mellitus who receive concomitant treatment with somatropin may require adjustment of their doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Common adverse reactions reported in adult and pediatric patients receiving somatropin include injection site reactions, hypersensitivity to the diluent, and hypothyroidism (6.1). Additional common adverse reactions in adults include edema, arthralgia, myalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, paraesthesias, and hyperglycemia (6.1, 6.2). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Most Serious and/or Most Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions This list presents the most seriousa and/or most frequently observedb adverse reactions during treatment with somatropin (including events observed in patients who received brands of somatropin other than Humatrope): aSudden death in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had risk factors including severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea and unidentified respiratory infection [see Contraindications (4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] aIntracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, in teenagers/young adults treated with radiation to the head for a first neoplasm who subsequently receive somatropin [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] aPancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] a,bGlucose intolerance including impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose as well as overt diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] aIntracranial hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] aSignificant diabetic retinopathy [see Contraindications (4.4)] aSlipped capital femoral epiphysis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] aProgression of preexisting scoliosis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] bFluid retention manifested by edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paraesthesias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] aUnmasking of latent central hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] aInjection site reactions/rashes and lipoatrophy (as well as rare generalized hypersensitivity reactions) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin formulation cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with a second somatropin formulation, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice. Pediatric Patients GH Deficiency As with all protein pharmaceuticals, a small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to the protein. During the first 6 months of Humatrope therapy in 314 naive patients, only 1.6% developed specific antibodies to Humatrope (binding capacity >=0.02 mg/L). None had antibody concentrations which exceeded 2 mg/L. Throughout 8 years of this same study, two patients (0.6%) had binding capacity >2 mg/L. Neither patient demonstrated a decrease in growth velocity at or near the time of increased antibody production. It has been reported that growth attenuation from pituitary-derived GH may occur when antibody concentrations are >1.5 mg/L. In addition to an evaluation of compliance with the treatment program and of thyroid status, testing for antibodies to somatropin should be carried out in any patient who fails to respond to therapy. In studies with GH deficient pediatric patients, injection site pain was reported infrequently. A mild and transient edema, which appeared in 2.5% of patients, was observed early during the course of treatment. Turner Syndrome In a randomized, concurrent-controlled, open-label trial, there was a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of otitis media (43% vs. 26%), ear disorders (18% vs. 5%) and surgical procedures (45% vs. 27%) in patients receiving Humatrope compared with untreated control patients (Table 1). A similar increase in otitis media was observed in an 18-month placebo-controlled trial. Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions of Special Interest by Treatment Group in Turner Syndrome a Open-label study. b Dose=0.3 mg/kg/wk. Treatment Groupa Adverse Reaction Untreated Humatropeb Significance Total Number of Patients 62 74 Surgical procedure 17 (27.4%) 33 (44.6%) p<=0.05 Otitis media 16 (25.8%) 32 (43.2%) p<=0.05 Ear disorders 3 (4.8%) 13 (17.6%) p<=0.05 Idiopathic Short Stature In a randomized, placebo-controlled study of Humatrope treatment (0.22 mg/kg/week) to adult height in patients with idiopathic short stature, the adverse events reported in Humatrope-treated patients (Table 2) were similar to those observed in other pediatric populations treated with Humatrope. Mean serum glucose concentration did not change during Humatrope treatment. Mean fasting serum insulin concentration increased 10% in the Humatrope treatment group at the end of treatment relative to baseline, but remained within the normal reference range. For the same duration of treatment, the mean fasting serum insulin concentration decreased by 2% in the placebo group. The occurrence rates of above-range values for glucose, insulin, and HbA1c were similar in the Humatrope (somatropin)- and placebo-treated groups. No patient developed diabetes mellitus. Consistent with the known mechanism of growth hormone action, Humatrope-treated patients had greater mean increases, relative to baseline, in serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) than placebo-treated patients at each study observation. However, there was no significant difference between the Humatrope and placebo treatment groups in the proportion of patients who had at least one serum IGF-I concentration more than 2.0 SD above the age- and gender-appropriate mean (Humatrope: 9 of 35 patients [26%]; placebo: 7 of 28 patients [25%]). Table 2: Non-serious Clinically Significant Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions by Treatment Group in Idiopathic Short Stature Treatment Group Adverse Reaction Placebo Humatrope Total Number of Patients 31 37 Scoliosis 4 (12.9%) 7 (18.9%) Otitis media 2 (6.5%) 6 (16.2%) Hyperlipidemia 1 (3.2%) 3 (8.1%) Gynecomastia 1 (3.2%) 2 (5.4%) Hip pain 0 1 (2.7%) Arthralgia 1 (3.2%) 4 (10.8%) Arthrosis 2 (6.5%) 4 (10.8%) Myalgia 4 (12.9%) 9 (24.3%) Hypertension 0 1 (2.7%) The adverse events observed in the dose-response study (239 patients treated for 2 years) did not indicate a pattern suggestive of a somatropin dose effect. Among Humatrope dose groups, mean fasting blood glucose, mean glycosylated hemoglobin, and the incidence of elevated fasting blood glucose concentrations were similar. One patient developed abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism (glucose intolerance and high serum HbA1c) on treatment. SHOX Deficiency Clinically significant adverse events (adverse events previously observed in association with growth hormone treatment in general) were assessed prospectively during the 2-year randomized, open-label study; those observed are presented in Table 3. In both treatment groups, the mean fasting plasma glucose concentration at the end of the first year was similar to the baseline value and remained in the normal range. No patient developed diabetes mellitus or had an above normal value for fasting plasma glucose at the end of one-year of treatment. During the 2 year study period, the proportion of patients who had at least one IGF-I concentration greater than 2.0 SD above the age- and gender-appropriate mean was 10 of 27 [37.0%] for the Humatrope-treated group vs. 0 of 24 patients [0.0%] for the untreated group. The proportion of patients who had at least one IGFBP-3 concentration greater than 2.0 SD above the age and gender appropriate mean was 16 of 27 [59.3%] for the Humatrope treated group vs. 7 of 24 [29.2%] for the untreated group. Table 3: Clinically Significant Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactionsa,b by Treatment Group in Patients with SHOX Deficiency a All events were non-serious. b Events are included only if reported for a greater number of Humatrope-treated than Untreated patients. c Percentage calculated for males only (1/12). Adverse Reaction Treatment Group Untreated Humatrope Total Number of Patients 25 27 Patients with at least one event 2 5 Arthralgia 2 (8.0%) 3 (11.1%) Gynecomastiac 0 (0.0%) 1 (8.3%) Excessive number of cutaneous nevi 0 (0.0%) 2 (7.4%) Scoliosis 0 (0.0%) 1 (3.7%) Small for Gestational Age Study 1 — In a 2-year, multicenter, randomized study, 193 non-GH deficient children with short stature born SGA who failed to demonstrate catch-up growth were treated with 2 different Humatrope treatment regimens: a fixed dose of 0.067 mg/kg/day (FHD group) or an individually adjusted dose regimen (IAD group; starting dose 0.035 mg/kg/day which could be increased as early as Month 3 to 0.067 mg/kg/day based on a validated growth prediction model). The most frequently reported adverse events were common childhood infectious diseases. Adverse events possibly/probably related to Humatrope were otitis media and headaches (where there was a suggestion of a modest dose response), and slipped capital femoral epiphysis (1 child) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There were no clear cut cases of new-onset diabetes mellitus, no children treated for hyperglycemia, and no children whose fasting blood glucose exceeded 126 mg/dL at any time during the study. However, 6 children (4 in the FHD group and 2 in the IAD group whose dose was increased from 0.035 mg/kg/day to 0.067 mg/kg/day [one at Month 3 and one at Year 1]) manifested impaired fasting glucose at Year 2. Two of these six children displayed impaired fasting glucose during the study as well, and one of them was required to discontinue Humatrope at Month 15 as a consequence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. A modestly dose-dependent increase in mean serum IGF-I SDS concentrations within the reference range was observed; of note, at study completion, 20-25% of these children had serum IGF-I SDS values > +2. Study 2 — A 2-year, open-label, single-arm study of Humatrope at a dosage of 0.067 mg/kg/day in 35 non-GH deficient children with short stature born SGA who failed to demonstrate catch-up growth did not reveal further safety data of note. Study 3 — Additional safety information was obtained from 340 short children born SGA followed in an observational study who received an average Humatrope dosage of 0.041 mg/kg/day (maximum dose: 0.084 mg/kg/day) for an average of 3.0 years. Type 2 diabetes mellitus apparently precipitated by Humatrope therapy was reported in a single patient, but appeared to resolve after discontinuation of Humatrope treatment, as the child had a normal oral glucose tolerance test and was receiving no antihyperglycemic medications 9 months after the drug was discontinued. One patient manifested carpal tunnel syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] and another developed an exacerbation of preexisting scoliosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)] which may have been related to Humatrope treatment. In both Study 1 and Study 2, after treatment with Humatrope, bone maturation did not accelerate excessively, and the timing of puberty was age-appropriate in boys and girls. Therefore, it can be concluded that no novel adverse events potentially related to treatment with Humatrope were reported in either short-term study or were apparent after a review of the post-marketing, observational, safety database. Adult Patients In clinical studies in which high doses of Humatrope were administered to healthy adult volunteers, the following events occurred infrequently: headache, localized muscle pain, weakness, mild hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Adult-Onset GH Deficiency In the first 6 months of controlled blinded trials during which patients received either Humatrope or placebo, adult-onset GH deficient adults who received Humatrope experienced a statistically significant increase in edema (Humatrope 17.3% vs. placebo 4.4%, p=0.043) and peripheral edema (11.5% vs. 0%, respectively, p=0.017). In patients with adult-onset GH deficiency, edema, muscle pain, joint pain, and joint disorder were reported early in therapy and tended to be transient or responsive to dosage titration. Two of 113 adult-onset patients developed carpal tunnel syndrome after beginning maintenance therapy without a low dose (0.00625 mg/kg/day) lead-in phase. Symptoms abated in these patients after dosage reduction. All treatment-emergent adverse events with >=5% overall occurrence rate during 12 or 18 months of replacement therapy with Humatrope are shown in Table 4 (adult-onset patients) and in Table 5 (childhood-onset patients). Adult patients treated with Humatrope who had been diagnosed with GH deficiency in childhood reported side effects less frequently than those with adult-onset GH deficiency.

Patients were randomized to receive either placebo injections or Humatrope (0.00625 mg/kg/day [6.25 μg/kg/day] for the first 4 weeks, then 0.0125 mg/kg/day [12.5 μg/kg/day] thereafter) for the first 6 months, followed by open-label Humatrope for the next 12 months for all patients. The patients in these studies reported side effects less frequently than those with adult-onset GH deficiency. During the placebo-controlled phase (first 6 months) of the study, elevations of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transferase were reported significantly more often for Humatrope-treated (12.5%) than placebo-treated patients (0.0%, p=0.031). No other events were reported significantly more often for Humatrope-treated patients during the placebo-controlled phase. The following events were reported for at least 5% of patients in either of the 2 treatment groups over the 18-month duration of the study, listed in descending order of maximum frequency for either group: aspartate aminotransferase increased 13%, headache 11%, edema 9%, pain 9%, alanine aminotransferase increased 6%, asthenia 6%, myalgia 6%, respiratory disorder 6%.

The adverse events reported during post-marketing surveillance do not differ from those listed/discussed above in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 in children and adults. Other adverse events that have been reported in somatropin-treated patients include the following: Neurologic — Headaches (common in children and occasional in adults). Skin — Increase in size or number of cutaneous nevi, especially in patients with Turner syndrome and those with SHOX deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Endocrine — Gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal — Pancreatitis. Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated patient, especially a child, who develops abdominal pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. Metabolic — New-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients. Neoplasia — Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GH deficient children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH), and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of leukemia are related to GH therapy, the pathology of GH deficiency itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy per se was responsible for these cases of leukemia. The risk for children with GH deficiency, if any, remains to be established [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In an ongoing post-marketing observational study of somatropin treatment in 3,102 GH-deficient adults, hypertension, dyspnea, and sleep apnea were reported by 1% to less than 10% of patients after various durations of treatment."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Critical Illness: Evaluate potential benefit of treatment continuation against potential risk. (5.1) Prader-Willi Syndrome: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment for GH deficiency. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur. (5.2) Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin - in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm. (5.3) Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients, as IGT or DM may be unmasked. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in patients with DM may require adjustment. (5.4) Intracranial Hypertension (IH): Exclude preexisting papilledema. IH may develop, but is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction. (5.5) Fluid Retention (e.g., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome - especially in adults): Reduce dose as necessary if such signs develop. (5.6) Hypothyroidism: Monitor thyroid function periodically as hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen after initiation of somatropin. (5.8) Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE): Evaluate any child with onset of a limp or hip/knee pain for possible SCFE. (5.9) Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis: Monitor any child with scoliosis for progression of the curve. (5.10) Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with abdominal pain, especially children. (5.12) 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic doses of somatropin [see Contraindications (4.1)]. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients experiencing acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of, or increased, snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Humatrope is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome. 5.3 Neoplasms In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent GH deficiency and were treated with somatropin, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence [see Contraindications (4.3)]. Monitor all patients receiving somatropin therapy who have a history of GH deficiency secondary to an intracranial neoplasm for progression or recurrence of the tumor. Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients. If treatment with somatropin is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms. Monitor patients receiving somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked, and new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (e.g., insulin or oral agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.7 Hypopituitarism Patients with hypopituitarism (multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies) should have their other hormonal replacement treatments closely monitored during somatropin treatment. 5.8 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GH deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests performed, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.9 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including pediatric GH deficiency and Turner syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy should be carefully evaluated. 5.10 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated patients with Turner syndrome. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy. 5.11 Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Patients with Turner Syndrome Patients with Turner syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders, as these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with Turner syndrome. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders (e.g., hypertension, aortic aneurysm or dissection, stroke) as patients with Turner syndrome are also at increased risk for these conditions. 5.12 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated patient, especially a child, who develops abdominal pain. 5.13 Local and Systemic Reactions When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. As with any protein, local or systemic allergic reactions may occur. Parents/patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 5.14 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone and IGF-I may increase after somatropin therapy."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibition of 11ß-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses (7.1) Glucocorticoid Replacement: Should be carefully adjusted (7.2) Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin (7.3) Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women (7.4) Insulin and/or Oral Hypoglycemic Agents: May require adjustment (7.5) 7.1 Inhibition of 11ß-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (11ßHSD-1) The microsomal enzyme 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. GH and somatropin inhibit 11βHSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GHD have relative increases in 11βHSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11ßHSD-1. 7.2 Physiologic Glucocorticoid Replacement and Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement dosing should be carefully adjusted in children receiving concomitant somatropin and glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. 7.3 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CYP450)- mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.4 Oral Estrogen In adult women on oral estrogen replacement, a larger dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the defined treatment goal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 7.5 Insulin and/or Oral Hypoglycemic Agents In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral agent may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Other common somatropin-related adverse reactions include injection site reactions/rashes and lipoatrophy (6.1) and headaches (6.3). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk at 1-888-NOVO-444 (1-888-668-6444) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Most Serious and/or Most Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions This list presents the most seriousb and/or most frequently observeda adverse reactions during treatment with somatropin: bSudden death in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome with risk factors including severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea and unidentified respiratory infection [see Contraindications (4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] bIntracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, in teenagers/young adults treated with radiation to the head as children for a first neoplasm and somatropin [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] a,bGlucose intolerance including impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose as well as overt diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] bIntracranial hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] bSignificant diabetic retinopathy [see Contraindications (4.4) ] bSlipped capital femoral epiphysis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] bProgression of preexisting scoliosis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] aFluid retention manifested by edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paraesthesias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] aUnmasking of latent central hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] aInjection site reactions/rashes and lipoatrophy (as well as rare generalized hypersensitivity reactions) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin formulation cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with a second somatropin formulation, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Pediatric GHD Patients As with all protein drugs, a small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to the protein. GH antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/L have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/L, interference with the growth response was observed. In clinical trials, patients receiving Norditropin for up to 12 months were tested for induction of antibodies, and 0/358 patients developed antibodies with binding capacities above 2 mg/L. Amongst these patients, 165 had previously been treated with other somatropin formulations, and 193 were previously untreated naive patients. Clinical Trials in Children with Noonan Syndrome Norditropin was studied in a two-year prospective, randomized, parallel dose group trial in 21 children, 3-14 years old, with Noonan syndrome. Doses were 0.033 and 0.066 mg/kg/day. After the initial two-year randomized trial, children continued Norditropin treatment until final height was achieved; randomized dose groups were not maintained. Final height and adverse event data were later collected retrospectively from 18 children; total follow-up was 11 years. An additional 6 children were not randomized, but followed the protocol and are included in this assessment of adverse events. Based on the mean dose per treatment group, no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events was seen between the two groups. The most frequent adverse events were the common infections of childhood, including upper respiratory infection, gastroenteritis, ear infection, and influenza. Cardiac disorders was the system organ class with the second most adverse events reported. However, congenital heart disease is an inherent component of Noonan syndrome, and there was no evidence of somatropin-induced ventricular hypertrophy or exacerbation of preexisting ventricular hypertrophy (as judged by echocardiography) during this study. Children who had baseline cardiac disease judged to be significant enough to potentially affect growth were excluded from the study; therefore the safety of Norditropin in children with Noonan syndrome and significant cardiac disease is not known. Among children who received 0.033 mg/kg/day, there was one adverse event of scoliosis; among children who received 0.066 mg/kg/day, there were four adverse events of scoliosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Mean serum IGF-I standard deviation score (SDS) levels did not exceed +1 in response to somatropin treatment. The mean serum IGF-I level was low at baseline and normalized during treatment. Clinical Trials in Children with Turner Syndrome In two clinical studies wherein children with Turner syndrome were treated until final height with various doses of Norditropin as described in Clinical Studies (14.2) , the most frequently reported adverse events were common childhood diseases including influenza-like illness, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis externa, gastroenteritis and eczema. Otitis media adverse events in Study 1 were most frequent in the highest dose groups (86.4% in the 0.045-0.067-0.089 mg/kg/day group vs. 78.3% in the 0.045-0.067 mg/kg/day group vs. 69.6% in the 0.045 mg/kg/day group) suggesting a possible dose-response relationship. Of note, approximately 40-50% of these otitis media adverse events were designated as "serious" [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. No patients in either study developed clearcut overt diabetes mellitus; however, in Study 1, impaired fasting glucose at Month 48 was more frequent in patients in the 0.045-0.067 mg/kg/day group (n=4/18) compared with the 0.045 mg/kg/day group (n=1/20). Transient episodes of fasting blood sugars between 100 and 126 mg/dL, and, on occasion, exceeding 126 mg/dL also occurred more often with larger doses of Norditropin in both studies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Three patients withdrew from the 2 high dose groups in Study 1 because of concern about excessive growth of hands or feet. In addition, in Study 1, exacerbation of preexisting scoliosis was designated a serious adverse reaction in two patients in the 0.045 mg/kg/day group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Clinical Trials in Children Born Small for Gestational Age (SGA) with No Catch-up Growth by Age 2-4 Years Study 1 (Long-Term) In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind study, 53 non-GHD children with short stature born SGA with failure to catch-up were treated with 2 doses of Norditropin (0.033 or 0.067 mg/kg/day) to final height for up to 13 years (mean duration of treatment 7.9 and 9.5 years for girls and boys, respectively). The most frequently reported adverse events were common childhood diseases including influenza-like illness, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, otitis media, pharyngitis, arthralgia, and headache. Adverse events possibly/probably related to Norditropin were otitis media, arthralgia, headaches (no confirmed diagnoses of benign intracranial hypertension), gynecomastia, and increased sweating. One child treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day for 4 years was reported with disproportionate growth of the lower jaw, and another child treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day developed a melanocytic nevus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. There were no clear cut reports of exacerbation of preexisting scoliosis or slipped capital femoral epiphysis. No apparent differences between the treatment groups were observed. In addition, the timing of puberty was age-appropriate in boys and girls in both treatment groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that no novel adverse events potentially related to treatment with Norditropin were reported in long-term Study 1. Study 2 (Short-Term) In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, 98 Japanese non-GHD children with short stature born SGA with failure to catch-up were treated with 2 doses of Norditropin (0.033 or 0.067 mg/kg/day) for 2 years or were untreated for 1 year. The most frequently reported adverse events were common childhood diseases almost identical to those reported above for Study 1. Adverse events possibly/probably related to Norditropin were otitis media, arthralgia and impaired glucose tolerance. No apparent differences between the treatment groups were observed. However, arthralgia and transiently impaired glucose tolerance were only reported in the 0.067 mg/kg/day treatment group. Therefore, it can also be concluded that no novel adverse events potentially related to treatment with rhGH were reported in short-term Study 2. As with all protein drugs, some patients may develop antibodies to the protein. Eighteen of the 76 children (~24%) treated with Norditropin developed anti-rhGH antibodies. However, these antibodies did not appear to be neutralizing in that the change from baseline in height SDS at Year 2 was similar in antibody positive and antibody negative children by treatment group. In both Study 1 and Study 2, there were no clear cut cases of new onset diabetes mellitus, no children treated for hyperglycemia, and no adverse event withdrawals due to abnormalities in glucose tolerance. In Study 2, after treatment with either dose of Norditropin for 2 years, there were no children with consecutive fasting blood glucose levels between 100 and 126 mg/dL, or with fasting blood glucose levels > 126 mg/dL. Furthermore, mean hemoglobin A1c levels tended to decrease during long-term treatment in Study 1, and remained normal in Study 2. However, in Study 1, 4 children treated with 0.067 mg/kg/day of Norditropin and 2 children treated with 0.033 mg/kg/day of Norditropin shifted from normal fasting blood glucose levels at baseline to increased levels after 1 year of treatment (100 to 126 mg/dL or > 126 mg/dL). In addition, small increases in mean fasting blood glucose and insulin levels (within the normal reference range) after 1 and 2 years of Norditropin treatment appeared to be dose-dependent [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In both Study 1 and Study 2, there was no acceleration of bone maturation. A dose-dependent increase in mean serum IGF-I SDS levels within the reference range (but including a substantial number of children with serum IGF-1 SDS > +2) was observed after both long-term (Study 1) and short-term (Study 2) Norditropin treatment. Clinical Trials in Adult GHD Patients Adverse events with an incidence of >=5% occurring in patients with AO GHD during the 6 month placebo-controlled portion of the largest of the six adult GHD Norditropin trials are presented in Table 1. Peripheral edema, other types of edema, arthralgia, myalgia, and paraesthesia were common in the Norditropin-treated patients, and reported much more frequently than in the placebo group. These types of adverse events are thought to be related to the fluid accumulating effects of somatropin. In general, these adverse events were mild and transient in nature. During the placebo-controlled portion of this study, approximately 5% of patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus treated with Norditropin were diagnosed with overt type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with none in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Anti-GH antibodies were not detected. Of note, the doses of Norditropin employed during this study (completed in the mid 1990s) were substantially larger than those currently recommended by the Growth Hormone Research Society, and, more than likely, resulted in a greater than expected incidence of fluid retention- and glucose intolerance-related adverse events. A similar incidence and pattern of adverse events were observed during the other three placebo-controlled AO GHD trials and during the two placebo-controlled CO GHD trials. Table 1 - Adverse Reactions with >=5% Overall Incidence in Adult Onset Growth Hormone Deficient Patients Treated with Norditropin During a Six Month Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial Norditropin(N=53) Placebo(N=52) Adverse Reactions n % n % Peripheral Edema 22 42 4 8 Edema 13 25 0 0 Arthralgia 10 19 8 15 Leg Edema 8 15 2 4 Myalgia 8 15 4 8 Infection (non-viral) 7 13 4 8 Paraesthesia 6 11 3 6 Skeletal Pain 6 11 1 2 Headache 5 9 3 6 Bronchitis 5 9 0 0 Flu-like symptoms 4 8 2 4 Hypertension 4 8 1 2 Gastroenteritis 4 8 4 8 Other Non-Classifiable Disorders (excludes accidental injury) 4 8 3 6 Increased sweating 4 8 1 2 Glucose tolerance abnormal 3 6 1 2 Laryngitis 3 6 3 6 The adverse event pattern observed during the open label phase of the study was similar to the one presented above. 6.3 Post-Marketing Surveillance Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The adverse events reported during post-marketing surveillance do not differ from those listed/discussed above in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 in children and adults. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GH deficient children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of leukemia are related to GH therapy, the pathology of GHD itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy per se was responsible for these cases of leukemia. The risk for children with GHD, if any, remains to be established [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The following additional adverse reactions have been observed during the appropriate use of somatropin: headaches (children and adults), gynecomastia (children), and pancreatitis (children)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Critical Illness: Potential benefit of treatment continuation should be weighed against the potential risk (5.1) Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment for GHD. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur (5.2) Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin - in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm (5.3) Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: May be unmasked. Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may require adjustment (5.4) Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema. May develop and is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction (5.5) Fluid Retention (i.e., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome - especially in adults): May occur frequently. Reduce dose as necessary (5.6) Hypothyroidism: May first become evident or worsen (5.7) Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: May develop. Evaluate children with the onset of a limp or hip/knee pain (5.8) Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis: May develop (5.9) 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4.1) ]. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients experiencing acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4.2) ]. Norditropin is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome. 5.3 Neoplasms Patients with preexisting tumors or GHD secondary to an intracranial lesion should be monitored routinely for progression or recurrence of the underlying disease process. In pediatric patients, clinical literature has revealed no relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and central nervous system (CNS) tumor recurrence or new extracranial tumors. However, in childhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported in patients treated with somatropin after their first neoplasm. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence. Patients should be monitored carefully for potential malignant transformation of skin lesions, i.e. increased growth of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Glucose Intolerance Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked during somatropin treatment. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (i.e., insulin or oral agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may frequently occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.7 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GHD, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. In patients with hypopituitarism (multiple hormone deficiencies), standard hormonal replacement therapy should be monitored closely when somatropin therapy is administered. 5.8 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GHD and Turner syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy should be carefully evaluated. 5.9 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated patients with Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy. 5.10 Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Turner Syndrome Patients with Turner syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders since these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with Turner syndrome. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders (e.g., stroke, aortic aneurysm/dissection, hypertension) as these patients are also at risk for these conditions. 5.11 Confirmation of Childhood Onset Adult GHD Patients with epiphyseal closure who were treated with somatropin replacement therapy in childhood should be reevaluated according to the criteria in Indications and Usage (1.2) before continuation of somatropin therapy at the reduced dose level recommended for GH deficient adults. 5.12 Local and Systemic Reactions When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. As with any protein, local or systemic allergic reactions may occur. Parents/Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 5.13 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IGF-I may increase after somatropin therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are injection site reactions (such as pain, numbness, redness, and swelling), fluid retention, peripheral edema, arthralgia, myalgia, paresthesia, and headache. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact EMD Serono at 1-800-283-8088 ext 5563 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin formulation cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with a second somatropin formulation, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice. Growth Hormone Deficient Pediatric Patients In clinical studies in which Saizen(R) was administered to growth hormone deficient children, the following reactions were infrequently seen: local reactions at the injection site (such as pain, numbness, redness and swelling), hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, seizures, exacerbation of preexisting psoriasis and disturbances in fluid balance. Growth Hormone Deficient Adult Patients For a description of the clinical trials refer to section 14. During the 6-month placebo-controlled study, adverse reactions were reported in 56 patients (93.3%) in the somatropin-treated group and 42 patients (76.4%) in the placebo-treated group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of >=5% in Saizen(R)-treated patients which were more frequent in Saizen(R)-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients are listed in Table 1. Arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral edema, other types of edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia were common in the somatropin-treated patients and reported more frequently than in the placebo group. These types of adverse reactions are thought to be related to the fluid accumulating effects of somatropin. During the placebo-controlled portion of the study, approximately 10% of patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance treated with somatropin manifested mild, but persistent, abnormalities of glucose tolerance, compared with none in the placebo group. During the open label phase of the study, approximately 10% of patients treated with somatropin required a small upward adjustment of thyroid hormone replacement therapy for preexisting central hypothyroidism and 1 patient was newly diagnosed with central hypothyroidism. In addition, during the open label phase of the study, when all patients were being treated with somatropin, two patients with preexisting central hypoadrenalism required upward titration of hydrocortisone maintenance therapy which was considered to be suboptimal (unrelated to intercurrent stress, surgery or disease), and 1 patient was diagnosed de novo with central adrenal insufficiency after six months of somatropin treatment. Anti-GH antibodies were not detected. Table 1 Adverse Reactions with >=5% Overall Incidence in Saizen(R)-Treated Patients Which Were More Frequent in Saizen(R)-Treated Patients Compared with Placebo-Treated Patients During a 6 Month Study Adverse Reaction Saizen(R)-Treated (N=60) Placebo (N=55) N = number of patients Arthralgia 14(23.3%) 7(12.7%) Headache 11(18.3%) 8(14.5%) Edema peripheral 9(15.0%) 2(3.7%) Myalgia 5(8.3%) 2(3.6%) Paraesthesia 4(6.7%) 1(1.8%) Hypoaesthesia 4(6.7%) 0 Edema dependent 3(5.0%) 2(3.6%) Skeletal Pain 3(5.0%) 1(1.8%) Carpal tunnel syndrome 3(5.0%) 1(1.8%) Edema generalized 3(5.0%) 0 Chest pain 3(5.0%) 0 Depression 3(5.0%) 0 Hypothyroidism 3(5.0%) 0 Insomnia 3(5.0%) 0 The adverse reaction pattern observed during the open label phase of the study was similar to the one presented above. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Saizen(R). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficient patients treated with growth hormone. It is uncertain whether this increased risk is related to the pathology of growth hormone deficiency itself, growth hormone therapy, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy for intracranial tumors. So far, epidemiological data fail to confirm the hypothesis of a relationship between growth hormone therapy and leukemia. The following additional adverse reactions have been observed during the appropriate use of somatropin: headaches (children and adults), gynecomastia (children), and pancreatitis (children and adults) (see Warnings and Precautions [5.14]). 6.3 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Saizen(R) with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In the case of growth hormone, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/mL have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/mL, interference with the growth response was observed."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Critical Illness: Potential benefit of treatment continuation should be weighed against the potential risk (5.1) Prader-Willi syndrome in Children: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur (5.2) Neoplasms: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin—in particular meningiomas as in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm (5.3) Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: May be unmasked. Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may require adjustment (5.4) Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema. May develop and is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction (5.5) Fluid Retention (i.e., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome - especially in adults): May occur frequently. Reduce dose as necessary (5.6) Hypothyroidism: May first become evident or worsen (5.7) Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: May develop. Evaluate children with the onset of a limp or hip/knee pain (5.8) Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis: May develop (5.9) Reevaluation of Childhood Onset Adult GHD (5.10) Hypopituitarism: Closely monitor other hormone replacement therapies (5.12) Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain (5.14) Benzyl Alcohol (5.15) 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4.1)]. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients having acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If, during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4.2)]. Saizen(R) is not indicated for the long term treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome. 5.3 Neoplasms In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent GHD and were treated with somatropin, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence [see Contraindications (4.3)]. Monitor all patients with a history of GHD secondary to an intracranial neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor. Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients. If treatment with somatropin is initiated, these patients should be monitored carefully for development of neoplasms. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Glucose Intolerance/Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked during somatropin treatment and new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (i.e., insulin or oral agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency, and Prader-Willi syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.7 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with growth hormone deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.8 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including pediatric growth hormone deficiency and Turner syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy should be carefully evaluated. 5.9 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated Turner syndrome patients. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy. 5.10 Reevaluation of Childhood Onset Adult GHD Patients with epiphyseal closure who were treated with somatropin replacement therapy in childhood should be reevaluated according to the criteria in INDICATIONS AND USAGE before continuation of somatropin therapy at the reduced dose level recommended for growth hormone deficient adults. Experience with prolonged treatment in adults is limited. 5.11 Local and Systemic Reaction When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site. As for any protein, local or systemic allergic reactions may occur. Parents/Patient should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 5.12 Hypopituitarism Patients with hypopituitarism (multiple hormone deficiencies) should have their other hormonal replacement therapy closely monitored during somatropin treatment. 5.13 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and IGF-1 may increase with somatropin therapy. 5.14 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated patient, especially a child, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain. 5.15 Benzyl Alcohol Benzyl alcohol, a component of this product, has been associated with serious adverse events and death, particularly in pediatric patients. The \"gasping syndrome,\" (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources."

The list of adverse events has been compiled regardless of casual relationship to Zorbtive(R). Body as a Whole, General: edema, periorbital edema Gastrointestinal System: melena, rectal hemorrhage, mouth disorder, steatorrhea Musculoskeletal System: arthritis, arthropathy, bursitis, cramps Resistance Mechanism Disorders: fungal infection Application Site Disorders: reaction pain, inflammation at injection sites Central and Peripheral Nervous System: parasthesia, phantom pain, visual field defect Respiratory System: bronchospasm, dyspnea, pharyngitis, respiratory disorder, respiratory infection Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: purpura, prothrombin decrease Skin and Appendages: skin disorder, increased sweating, alopecia, bullous eruption Psychiatric: insomnia Metabolic and Nutritional: hypomagnesemia, Urinary System Disorders: dysuria, urinary tract infection, abnormal urine Reproduction Disorders, Female: breast enlargement, vaginal fungal infection Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders: tachycardia Vascular Extracardiac Disorders: vasodilatation The safety profile of patients receiving Zorbtive(R) with glutamine was similar to the safety profile of patients receiving Zorbtive(R) without glutamine. During the baseline period, 88% of patients receiving Zorbtive(R) with glutamine, 88% of patients receiving Zorbtive(R) without glutamine, and 78% of patients receiving Zorbtive(R) placebo with glutamine reported baseline signs and symptoms (BSS). During the treatment period, 100% of patients receiving Zorbtive(R) with and without glutamine reported at least one adverse event (AE), whereas 89% of patients receiving Zorbtive(R) placebo with glutamine reported at least one AE. During the follow-up period, 81% of patients receiving Zorbtive(R) with glutamine, 80% of patients receiving Zorbtive(R) without glutamine and 78% of patients receiving Zorbtive(R) placebo with glutamine experienced at least one AE. Comparison of the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) before and during treatment demonstrates that this subject population experiences numerous BSSs and AEs due to their underlying conditions and parenteral nutrition complications. Four subjects (25%) receiving Zorbtive(R) without glutamine and one subject (11%) receiving Zorbtive(R) placebo with glutamine experienced at least one SAE during the treatment period (Zorbtive(R) without glutamine: chest pain, purpura, fungal infection, pharyngitis; Zorbtive(R) placebo with glutamine: hemorrhoids). None of the subjects receiving Zorbtive(R) with glutamine experienced SAEs during the treatment period. During the follow-up period, 3 subjects (19%) receiving Zorbtive(R) with glutamine, 5 subjects (33%) receiving Zorbtive(R) without glutamine and 3 subjects (33%) receiving Zorbtive(R) placebo with glutamine experienced at least one SAE. There were no deaths in this study."

        "Drug Interactions Somatropin inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) in adipose/hepatic tissue and may significantly impact the metabolism of cortisol and cortisone. As a consequence, in patients treated with somatropin, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked requiring glucocorticoid replacement therapy. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement therapy for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of the 11βHSD-1 enzyme. Excessive glucocorticoid therapy may attenuate the growth-promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement therapy should be carefully adjusted in children with concomitant GH and glucocorticoid deficiency to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. The use of Nutropin in patients with CRI requiring glucocorticoid therapy has not been evaluated. Concomitant glucocorticoid therapy may inhibit the growth promoting effect of Nutropin. Therefore, if glucocorticoid replacement is required for CRI, the glucocorticoid dose should be carefully adjusted to avoid an inhibitory effect on growth. There was no evidence in the controlled studies of Nutropin's interaction with drugs commonly used in chronic renal insufficiency patients. Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450) mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporin). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. In adult women on oral estrogen replacement, a larger dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the defined treatment goal (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral agent may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated (see PRECAUTIONS, General)."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS As with all protein pharmaceuticals, a small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to the protein. GH antibody binding capacities below 2 mg/L have not been associated with growth attenuation. In some cases when binding capacity exceeds 2 mg/L, growth attenuation has been observed. In clinical studies of pediatric patients that were treated with Nutropin for the first time, 0/107 growth hormone-deficient (GHD) patients, 0/125 CRI patients, 0/112 Turner syndrome, and 0/117 ISS patients screened for antibody production developed antibodies with binding capacities >= 2 mg/L at six months. Additional short-term immunologic and renal function studies were carried out in a group of patients with CRI after approximately one year of treatment to detect other potential adverse effects of antibodies to GH. Testing included measurements of C1q, C3, C4, rheumatoid factor, creatinine, creatinine clearance, and BUN. No adverse effects of GH antibodies were noted. In addition to an evaluation of compliance with the prescribed treatment program and thyroid status, testing for antibodies to GH should be carried out in any patient who fails to respond to therapy. In a post-marketing surveillance study, the National Cooperative Growth Study, the pattern of adverse events in over 8000 patients with idiopathic short stature was consistent with the known safety profile of GH, and no new safety signals attributable to GH were identified. The frequency of protocol-defined targeted adverse events is described in the table, below. Protocol-Defined Targeted Adverse Events in the ISS NCGS Cohort Reported Events NCGS (N=8018) AVN=avascular necrosis; SCFE=slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Data obtained with several rhGH products (Nutropin, Nutropin AQ, Nutropin Depot and Protropin). Any adverse event Overall 103 (1.3%) Targeted adverse event Overall 103 (1.3%) Injection-site reaction 28 (0.3%) New onset or progression of scoliosis 16 (0.2%) Gynecomastia 12 (0.1%) Any new onset or recurring tumor (benign) 12 (0.1%) Arthralgia or arthritis 10 (0.1%) Diabetes mellitus 5 (0.1%) Edema 5 (0.1%) Cancer, neoplasm (new onset or recurrence) 4(0.0%) Fracture 4(0.0%) Intracranial hypertension 4(0.0%) Abnormal bone or other growth 3(0.0%) Central nervous system tumor 2(0.0%) New or recurrent SCFE or AVN 2(0.0%) Carpal tunnel syndrome 1(0.0%) In studies in patients treated with Nutropin, injection site pain was reported infrequently. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GHD patients treated with GH. It is uncertain whether this increased risk is related to the pathology of GH deficiency itself, GH therapy, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy for intracranial tumors. On the basis of current evidence, experts cannot conclude that GH therapy is responsible for these occurrences. The risk to GHD, CRI, or Turner syndrome patients, if any, remains to be established. Other adverse drug reactions that have been reported in GH-treated patients include the following: 1)Metabolic: mild, transient peripheral edema. In GHD adults, edema or peripheral edema was reported in 41% of GH-treated patients and 25% of placebo-treated patients; 2)Musculoskeletal: arthralgias; carpal tunnel syndrome. In GHD adults, arthralgias and other joint disorders were reported in 27% of GH-treated patients and 15% of placebo-treated patients; 3)Skin: rare increased growth of pre-existing nevi; patients should be monitored for malignant transformation; and 4)Endocrine: gynecomastia. Rare pancreatitis."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibition of 11ß-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses (7.1, 7.2). Glucocorticoid Replacement: Should be carefully adjusted (7.2) Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin (7.3) Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women (7.4) Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents: May require adjustment (7.5) 7.1 11 β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 The microsomal enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. GH and somatropin inhibit 11βHSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11βHSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1. 7.2 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocortioid Treatment Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement dosing should be carefully adjusted in children receiving concomitant somatropin and glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. 7.3 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.4 Oral Estrogen In patients on oral estrogen replacement, a larger dose of somatropin may be required to achieve the defined treatment goal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 7.5 Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral/injectable agent may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)])."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Other common somatropin-related adverse reactions include injection site reactions/rashes and lipoatrophy (6.1) and headaches (6.3). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Most Serious and/or Most Frequently Observed Adverse Reactions This list presents the most seriousb and/or most frequently observeda adverse reactions during treatment with somatropin: b Sudden death in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome with risk factors including severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea and unidentified respiratory infection [see Contraindications (4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] b Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, in teenagers/young adults treated with radiation to the head as children for a first neoplasm and somatropin [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] a, b Glucose intolerance including impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose as well as overt diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] b Intracranial hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] b Significant diabetic retinopathy [see Contraindications (4.4)] b Slipped capital femoral epiphysis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] b Progression of preexisting scoliosis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] aFluid retention manifested by edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paraesthesias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] aUnmasking of latent central hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] aInjection site reactions/rashes and lipoatrophy (as well as rare generalized hypersensitivity reactions) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] b Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin formulation cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with a second somatropin formulation, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in children with GHD In clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric GHD patients, the following events were reported infrequently: injection site reactions, including pain or burning associated with the injection, fibrosis, nodules, rash, inflammation, pigmentation, or bleeding; lipoatrophy; headache; hematuria; hypothyroidism; and mild hyperglycemia. Clinical Trials in PWS In two clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, the following drug-related events were reported: edema, aggressiveness, arthralgia, benign intracranial hypertension, hair loss, headache, and myalgia. Clinical Trials in children with SGA In clinical studies of 273 pediatric patients born small for gestational age treated with GENOTROPIN, the following clinically significant events were reported: mild transient hyperglycemia, one patient with benign intracranial hypertension, two patients with central precocious puberty, two patients with jaw prominence, and several patients with aggravation of preexisting scoliosis, injection site reactions, and self-limited progression of pigmented nevi. Anti-hGH antibodies were not detected in any of the patients treated with GENOTROPIN. Clinical Trials in children with Turner Syndrome In two clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with Turner syndrome, the most frequently reported adverse events were respiratory illnesses (influenza, tonsillitis, otitis, sinusitis), joint pain, and urinary tract infection. The only treatment-related adverse event that occurred in more than 1 patient was joint pain. Clinical Trials in children with Idiopathic Short Stature In two open-label clinical studies with GENOTROPIN in pediatric patients with ISS, the most commonly encountered adverse events include upper respiratory tract infections, influenza, tonsillitis, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, headaches, increased appetite, pyrexia, fracture, altered mood, and arthralgia. In one of the two studies, during Genotropin treatment, the mean IGF-1 standard deviation (SD) scores were maintained in the normal range. IGF-1 SD scores above +2 SD were observed as follows: 1 subject (3%), 10 subjects (30%) and 16 subjects (38%) in the untreated control, 0. 23 and the 0.47 mg/kg/week groups, respectively, had at least one measurement; while 0 subjects (0%), 2 subjects (7%) and 6 subjects (14%) had two or more consecutive IGF-1 measurements above +2 SD. Clinical Trials in adults with GHD In clinical trials with GENOTROPIN in 1,145 GHD adults, the majority of the adverse events consisted of mild to moderate symptoms of fluid retention, including peripheral swelling, arthralgia, pain and stiffness of the extremities, peripheral edema, myalgia, paresthesia, and hypoesthesia. These events were reported early during therapy, and tended to be transient and/or responsive to dosage reduction. Table 1 displays the adverse events reported by 5% or more of adult GHD patients in clinical trials after various durations of treatment with GENOTROPIN. Also presented are the corresponding incidence rates of these adverse events in placebo patients during the 6-month double-blind portion of the clinical trials.

All 12 patients had predisposing factors, e.g., elevated glycated hemoglobin levels and/or marked obesity, prior to receiving GENOTROPIN. Of the 3,031 patients receiving GENOTROPIN, 61 (2%) developed symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, which lessened after dosage reduction or treatment interruption (52) or surgery (9). Other adverse events that have been reported include generalized edema and hypoesthesia. Anti-hGH Antibodies As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to GENOTROPIN with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In the case of growth hormone, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/mL have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/mL, interference with the growth response was observed. In 419 pediatric patients evaluated in clinical studies with GENOTROPIN lyophilized powder, 244 had been treated previously with GENOTROPIN or other growth hormone preparations and 175 had received no previous growth hormone therapy. Antibodies to growth hormone (anti-hGH antibodies) were present in six previously treated patients at baseline. Three of the six became negative for anti-hGH antibodies during 6 to 12 months of treatment with GENOTROPIN. Of the remaining 413 patients, eight (1.9%) developed detectable anti-hGH antibodies during treatment with GENOTROPIN; none had an antibody binding capacity > 2 mg/L. There was no evidence that the growth response to GENOTROPIN was affected in these antibody-positive patients. Periplasmic Escherichia coli Peptides Preparations of GENOTROPIN contain a small amount of periplasmic Escherichia coli peptides (PECP). Anti-PECP antibodies are found in a small number of patients treated with GENOTROPIN, but these appear to be of no clinical significance. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The adverse events reported during post-marketing surveillance do not differ from those listed/discussed above in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 in children and adults. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GHD children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of leukemia are related to GH therapy, the pathology of GHD itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy per se was responsible for these cases of leukemia. The risk for children with GHD, if any, remains to be established [see Contraindications (4.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The following additional adverse reactions have been observed during the appropriate use of somatropin: headaches (children and adults), gynecomastia (children), and pancreatitis (children and adults, see Warnings and Precautions [5.14] ). New-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Critical Illness: Potential benefit of treatment continuation should be weighed against the potential risk (5.1). Prader-Willi syndrome in Children: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur (5.2). Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm (5.3). Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: May be unmasked. Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may require adjustment (5.4). Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema. May develop and is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction (5.5). Fluid Retention (i.e., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome - especially in adults): May occur frequently. Reduce dose as necessary (5.6). Hypopituitarism: Closely monitor other hormone replacement therapies (5.7). Hypothyroidism: May first become evident or worsen (5.8). Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: May develop. Evaluate children with the onset of a limp or hip/knee pain (5.9). Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis: May develop (5.10) Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain (5.14). 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4.1)]. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients having acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4.2)]. 5.3 Neoplasms In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent GHD and were treated with somatropin, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence [see Contraindications (4.3) ]. Monitor all patients with a history of GHD secondary to an intracranial neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor. Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients. If treatment with somatropin is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked during somatropin treatment. New-onset Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (i.e., insulin or oral/injectable agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with Turner syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.7 Hypopituitarism Patients with hypopituitarism (multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies) should have their other hormonal replacement treatments closely monitored during somatropin treatment. 5.8 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with Turner syndrome have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with growth hormone deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.9 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphyses in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphyses may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GHD and Turner syndrome) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy should be carefully evaluated. 5.10 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated Turner syndrome patients. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy. 5.11 Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Turner Syndrome Patients with Turner syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders since these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with Turner syndrome. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders (e.g., stroke, aortic aneurysm/dissection, hypertension) as these patients are also at risk for these conditions. 5.12 Local and Systemic Reactions When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration. (2.3) ]. As with any protein, local or systemic allergic reactions may occur. Parents/Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 5.13 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IGF-I may increase during somatropin therapy. 5.14 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have Turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin-treated patient, especially a child, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain."
