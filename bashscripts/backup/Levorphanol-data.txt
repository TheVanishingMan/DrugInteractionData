        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In approximately 1400 patients treated with levorphanol in controlled clinical trials, the type and incidence of side effects were those expected of an opioid analgesic, and no unforeseen or unusual toxicity was reported. Drugs of this type are expected to produce a cluster of typical opioid effects in addition to analgesia, consisting of nausea, vomiting, altered mood and mentation, pruritus, flushing, difficulties in urination, constipation, and biliary spasm. The frequency and intensity of these effects appears to be dose related. Although listed as adverse events these are expected pharmacologic actions of these drugs and should be interpreted as such by the clinician. The following adverse events have been reported with the use of levorphanol: Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, dry mouth, sweating Cardiovascular System: cardiac arrest, shock, hypotension, arrhythmias including bradycardia and tachycardia, palpitations, extra-systoles Digestive System: nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, biliary tract spasm Nervous System: coma, suicide attempt, convulsions, depression, dizziness, confusion, lethargy, abnormal dreams, abnormal thinking, nervousness, drug withdrawal, hypokinesia, dyskinesia, hyperkinesia, CNS stimulation, personality disorder, amnesia, insomnia Respiratory System: apnea, cyanosis, hypoventilation Skin & Appendages: pruritus, urticaria, rash, injection site reaction Special Senses: abnormal vision, pupillary disorder, diplopia Urogenital System: kidney failure, urinary retention, difficulty urinating"

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Interactions with Other CNS Agents Concurrent use of levorphanol with all central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, other opioids, general anesthetics, barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants and antihistamines) may result in additive central nervous system depressant effects. Respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may occur. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. Although no interaction between MAO inhibitors and levorphanol has been observed, it is not recommended for use with MAO inhibitors. Most cases of serious or fatal adverse events involving levorphanol reported to the manufacturer or the FDA have involved either the administration of large initial doses of the drug or too frequent doses of the drug to non-opioid tolerant patients, or the simultaneous administration of levorphanol with other drugs affecting respiration (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE and WARNINGS). The initial dose of levorphanol should be reduced by approximately 50% or more when it is given to patients along with another drug affecting respiration. Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as levorphanol. In opioid-dependent patients, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may precipitate withdrawal symptoms."
