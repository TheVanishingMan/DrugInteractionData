        "ADVERSE REACTIONS More than 6,000 patients world-wide have received nisoldipine in clinical trials for the treatment of hypertension, either as the immediate-release or the nisoldipine extended-release formulation. Of about 1,500 patients who received nisoldipine extended-release in hypertension studies, about 55% were exposed for at least 2 months and about one-third were exposed for over 6 months, the great majority at doses equivalent to 17 mg and above. Nisoldipine extended-release is generally well tolerated. In the U.S. clinical trials of nisoldipine extended-release in hypertension, 10.9% of the 921 nisoldipine extended-release patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 2.9% of 280 placebo patients. The frequency of discontinuations due to adverse experiences was related to dose, with a 5.4% and 10.9% discontinuation rate at the lowest and highest daily dose, respectively. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences with nisoldipine extended-release are those related to its vasodilator properties; these are generally mild and only occasionally lead to patient withdrawal from treatment. The table below, from U.S. placebo-controlled parallel dose response trials of nisoldipine extended-release using doses across the clinical dosage range in patients with hypertension, lists all of the adverse events, regardless of the causal relationship to nisoldipine extended release, for which the overall incidence on nisoldipine extended-release was both > 1% and greater with nisoldipine extended-release than with placebo. Adverse Event Nisoldipine (%) (n = 663) Placebo (%) (n = 280) Peripheral Edema 22 10 Headache 22 15 Dizziness 5 4 Pharyngitis 5 4 Vasodilation 4 2 Sinusitis 3 2 Palpitation 3 1 Chest Pain 2 1 Nausea 2 1 Rash 2 1 Only peripheral edema and possibly dizziness appear to be dose related. Adverse Event Nisoldipine Extended-release, dose bioequivalent to: Placebo 8.5 mg 17 mg 25.5 mg 34 mg (Rates in %) n = 280 n = 30 n = 170 n = 105 n = 139 Peripheral Edema 10 7 15 20 27 Dizziness 4 7 3 3 4 The common adverse events occurred at about the same rate in men as in women, and at a similar rate in patients over age 65 as in those under that age, except that headache was much less common in older patients. Except for peripheral edema and vasodilation, which were more common in whites, adverse event rates were similar in blacks and whites. The following adverse events occurred in <= 1% of all patients treated for hypertension in U.S. and foreign clinical trials, or with unspecified incidence in other studies. Although a causal relationship of nisoldipine extended-release to these events cannot be established, they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship with nisoldipine extended-release treatment. Body as a Whole: cellulitis, chills, facial edema, fever, flu syndrome, malaise Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, first degree AV block, hypertension, hypotension, jugular venous distension, migraine, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, ventricular extrasystoles, supraventricular tachycardia, syncope, systolic ejection murmur, T wave abnormalities on ECG (flattening, inversion, nonspecific changes), venous insufficiency Digestive: abnormal liver function tests, anorexia, colitis, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, dysphagia, flatulence, gastritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gingival hyperplasia, glossitis, hepatomegaly, increased appetite, melena, mouth ulceration Endocrine: diabetes mellitus, thyroiditis Hemic and Lymphatic: anemia, ecchymoses, leukopenia, petechiae Metabolic and Nutritional: gout, hypokalemia, increased serum creatine kinase, increased nonprotein nitrogen, weight gain, weight loss Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis, leg cramps, myalgia, myasthenia, myositis, tenosynovitis Nervous: abnormal dreams, abnormal thinking and confusion, amnesia, anxiety, ataxia, cerebral ischemia, decreased libido, depression, hypesthesia, hypertonia, insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, tremor, vertigo Respiratory: asthma, dyspnea, end inspiratory wheeze and fine rales, epistaxis, increased cough, laryngitis, pharyngitis, pleural effusion, rhinitis, sinusitis Skin and Appendages: acne, alopecia, dry skin, exfoliative dermatitis, fungal dermatitis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, maculopapular rash, pruritus, pustular rash, skin discoloration, skin ulcer, sweating, urticaria Special Senses: abnormal vision, amblyopia, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, ear pain, glaucoma, itchy eyes, keratoconjunctivitis, otitis media, retinal detachment, tinnitus, watery eyes, taste disturbance, temporary unilateral loss of vision, vitreous floater Urogenital: dysuria, hematuria, nocturia, urinary frequency, increased BUN and serum creatinine, vaginal hemorrhage, vaginitis. The following post-marketing event has been reported very rarely in patients receiving nisoldipine extended-release: systemic hypersensitivity reaction, which may include one or more of the following; angioedema, shortness of breath, tachycardia, chest tightness, hypotension, and rash. A definite causal relationship with nisoldipine extended-release has not been established. An unusual event observed with immediate-release nisoldipine but not observed with nisoldipine extended-release was one case of photosensitivity. Gynecomastia has been associated with the use of calcium channel blockers."

        "Drug Interactions A 30 to 45% increase in AUC and Cmax of nisoldipine was observed with concomitant administration of cimetidine 400 mg twice daily. Ranitidine 150 mg twice daily did not interact significantly with nisoldipine (AUC was decreased by 15-20%). No pharmacodynamic effects of either histamine H2 receptor antagonist were observed. CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers: Nisoldipine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and coadministration should be avoided in general. Coadministration of phenytoin with a dose bioequivalent to 34 mg Nisoldipine tablets in epileptic patients lowered the nisoldipine plasma concentrations to undetectable levels. Coadministration of Nisoldipine with phenytoin should be avoided and alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered. Pharmacokinetic interactions between nisoldipine and beta-blockers (atenolol, propranolol) were variable and not significant. Propranolol attenuated the heart rate increase following administration of immediate release nisoldipine. The blood pressure effect of Nisoldipine tended to be greater in patients on atenolol than in patients on no other antihypertensive therapy. Quinidine at 648 mg bid decreased the bioavailability (AUC) of nisoldipine by 26%, but not the peak concentration. Immediate release nisoldipine increased plasma quinidine concentrations by about 20%. This interaction was not accompanied by ECG changes and its clinical significance is not known. No significant interactions were found between nisoldipine and warfarin or digoxin."

Body As A Whole: cellulitis, chills, facial edema, fever, flu syndrome, malaise Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, first degree AV block, hypertension, hypotension, jugular venous distension, migraine, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, ventricular extrasystoles, supraventricular tachycardia, syncope, systolic ejection murmur, T wave abnormalities on ECG (flattening, inversion, nonspecific changes), venous insufficiency Digestive: abnormal liver function tests, anorexia, colitis, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, dysphagia, flatulence, gastritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gingival hyperplasia, glossitis, hepatomegaly, increased appetite, melena, mouth ulceration Endocrine: diabetes mellitus, thyroiditis Hemic and Lymphatic: anemia, ecchymoses, leukopenia, petechiae Metabolic and Nutritional: gout, hypokalemia, increased serum creatine kinase, increased nonprotein nitrogen, weight gain, weight loss Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis, leg cramps, myalgia, myasthenia, myositis, tenosynovitis Nervous: abnormal dreams, abnormal thinking and confusion, amnesia, anxiety, ataxia, cerebral ischemia, decreased libido, depression, hypesthesia, hypertonia, insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, tremor, vertigo Respiratory: asthma, dyspnea, end inspiratory wheeze and fine rales, epistaxis, increased cough, laryngitis, pharyngitis, pleural effusion, rhinitis, sinusitis Skin and Appendages: acne, alopecia, dry skin, exfoliative dermatitis, fungal dermatitis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, maculopapular rash, pruritus, pustular rash, skin discoloration, skin ulcer, sweating, urticaria Special Senses: abnormal vision, amblyopia, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, ear pain, glaucoma, itchy eyes, keratoconjunctivitis, otitis media, retinal detachment, tinnitus, watery eyes, taste disturbance, temporary unilateral loss of vision, vitreous floater Urogenital: dysuria, hematuria, impotence, nocturia, urinary frequency, increased BUN and serum creatinine, vaginal hemorrhage, vaginitis. The following postmarketing event has been reported very rarely in patients receiving nisoldipine extended-release: systemic hypersensitivity reaction which may include one or more of the following; angioedema, shortness of breath, tachycardia, chest tightness, hypotension, and rash. A definite causal relationship with nisoldipine extended-release has not been established. An unusual event observed with immediate release nisoldipine but not observed with nisoldipine extended-release was one case of photosensitivity. Gynecomastia has been associated with the use of calcium channel blockers."

        "Drug Interactions A 30 to 45% increase in AUC and Cmax of nisoldipine was observed with concomitant administration of cimetidine 400 mg twice daily. Ranitidine 150 mg twice daily did not interact significantly with nisoldipine (AUC was decreased by 15 - 20%). No pharmacodynamic effects of either histamine H2 receptor antagonist were observed. CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers SULAR is substrate of CYP3A4 and coadministration of SULAR with any known inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4 should be avoided in general. Coadministration of phenytoin with a dose bioequivalent to 34 mg SULAR tablets in epileptic patients lowered the nisoldipine plasma concentrations to undetectable levels. Coadministration of SULAR with phenytoin should be avoided and alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered. Pharmacokinetic interactions between nisoldipine and beta-blockers (atenolol, propranolol) were variable and not significant. Propranolol attenuated the heart rate increase following administration of immediate release nisoldipine. The blood pressure effect of SULAR tended to be greater in patients on atenolol than in patients on no other antihypertensive therapy. Quinidine at 648 mg bid decreased the bioavailability (AUC) of nisoldipine by 26%, but not the peak concentration. Immediate release nisoldipine increased plasma quinidine concentrations by about 20%. This interaction was not accompanied by ECG changes and its clinical significance is not known. No significant interactions were found between nisoldipine and warfarin of digoxin."

        "ADVERSE EXPERIENCES More than 6000 patients world-wide have received nisoldipine in clinical trials for the treatment of hypertension, either as the immediate release or the SULAR extended release formulation. Of about 1,500 patients who received SULAR in hypertension studies, about 55% were exposed for at least 2 months and about one third were exposed for over 6 months, the great majority at doses equivalent to 17 mg and above. SULAR is generally well-tolerated. In the U.S. clinical trials of SULAR in hypertension, 10.9% of the 921 SULAR patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 2.9% of 280 placebo patients. The frequency of discontinuations due to adverse experiences was related to dose, with a 5.4% and 10.9% discontinuation rate at the lowest and highest daily dose, respectively. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences with SULAR are those related to its vasodilator properties; these are generally mild and only occasionally lead to patient withdrawal from treatment. The table below, from U.S. placebo-controlled parallel dose response trials of SULAR using doses across the clinical dosage range in patients with hypertension, lists all of the adverse events, regardless of the causal relationship to SULAR, for which the overall incidence on SULAR was both >1% and greater with SULAR than with placebo. Adverse Event Nisoldipine (%) (n=663) Placebo (%) (n=280) Only peripheral edema and possibly dizziness appear to be dose related. Peripheral Edema 22 10 Headache 22 15 Dizziness 5 4 Pharyngitis 5 4 Vasodilation 4 2 Sinusitis 3 2 Palpitation 3 1 Chest Pain 2 1 Nausea 2 1 Rash 2 1 Adverse Event SULAR, dose bioequivalent to: Placebo 8.5mg 17mg 25.5mg 34mg (Rates in %) N=280 N=30 N=170 N=105 N=139 Peripheral Edema 10 7 15 20 27 Dizziness 4 7 3 3 4 The common adverse events occurred at about the same rate in men as in women, and at a similar rate in patients over age 65 as in those under that age, except that headache was much less common in older patients. Except for peripheral edema and vasodilation, which were more common in whites, adverse event rates were similar in blacks and whites.
