Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When VFEND is discontinued, cyclosporine concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. MethadoneResults based on in vivo clinical study following repeat oral dosing with 400 mg q12h for 1 day, then 200 mg q12h for 4 days voriconazole to subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30-100 mg q24h) (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed Fentanyl (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Reduction in the dose of fentanyl and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with VFEND. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)] Alfentanil (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of alfentanil and other opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with VFEND. A longer period for monitoring respiratory and other opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Oxycodone (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with VFEND. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)]. NSAIDsNon-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug including. ibuprofen and diclofenac (CYP2C9 Inhibition) Increased Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to NSAIDs. Dose reduction of NSAIDs may be needed [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Tacrolimus (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased When initiating therapy with VFEND in patients already receiving tacrolimus, reduce the tacrolimus dose to one-third of the starting dose and follow with frequent monitoring of tacrolimus blood levels. Increased tacrolimus levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When VFEND is discontinued, tacrolimus concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. Phenytoin (CYP2C9 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Frequent monitoring of phenytoin plasma concentrations and frequent monitoring of adverse effects related to phenytoin. Oral Contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Monitoring for adverse events related to oral contraceptives is recommended during coadministration. Warfarin (CYP2C9 Inhibition) Prothrombin Time Significantly Increased Monitor PT or other suitable anti-coagulation tests. Adjustment of warfarin dosage may be needed. Omeprazole (CYP2C19/3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased When initiating therapy with VFEND in patients already receiving omeprazole doses of 40 mg or greater, reduce the omeprazole dose by one-half. The metabolism of other proton pump inhibitors that are CYP2C19 substrates may also be inhibited by voriconazole and may result in increased plasma concentrations of other proton pump inhibitors.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3.0%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see Warning and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 3 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11-90, including 51 patients aged 12-18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 3 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with VFEND. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, VFEND should be discontinued. In addition, VFEND has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during VFEND therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, VFEND should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in <2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1655).

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of VFEND therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during VFEND therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of VFEND must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to VFEND [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 4 to 6 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]."

Also, see Table 8 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with VFEND (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of VFEND therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, VFEND should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.6), and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of VFEND on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Use in Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present Sinus bradycardia Existing symptomatic arrhythmias Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.7 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during VFEND therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.8 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving VFEND [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. VFEND has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). VFEND has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.9 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.10 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.11 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during VFEND treatment. 5.12 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with VFEND. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, VFEND should be discontinued. VFEND has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during VFEND treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and VFEND discontinuation should be considered. If VFEND is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term VFEND therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, VFEND should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.13 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash and visual disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3) ]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1,655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and nonneutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years) and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over 6 months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >= 2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of < 2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below. Table 2.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in < 2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (n = 1,655).

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 3 to 5 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole. Table 3.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) - Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) - Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) - Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) - Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Do not use (5.5) - Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) - Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) - Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. Monitoring of Hepatic Function Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.7) and Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with these potentially proarrhythmic conditions. Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients with Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients should avoid intense or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4) ]."

Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, cyclosporine concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. Methadone*** (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed Fentanyl (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Reduction in the dose of fentanyl and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) ] Alfentanil (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of alfentanil and other opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1-888-721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 orwww.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1,655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in <2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1,655).

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole tablets must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 3 to 5 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) - Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) - Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) - Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) - Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Do not use (5.5) - Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) - Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis): Stop the infusion (5.7) - Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) - Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole tablets therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole tablets should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.7), and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Use in Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as. -Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation -Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present -Sinus bradycardia -Existing symptomatic arrhythmias -Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8)]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. Voriconazole tablets has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole tablets treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole tablets discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole tablets is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicityrelated lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole tablets therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole tablets should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]."

Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, cyclosporine concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. Methadone*** (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed Fentanyl (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Reduction in the dose of fentanyl and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) ] Alfentanil (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of alfentanil and other opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3) ]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 3 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 3 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy.

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 4 to 6 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Do not use (5.5) Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis): Stop the infusion (5.7) Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 8 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.7) , and Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Use in Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present Sinus bradycardia Existing symptomatic arrhythmias Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3) ]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 3 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1,655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years) and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over 6 months. Table 3 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >= 2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of < 2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below. Table 3.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been postmarketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in < 2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N = 1,655).

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 4 to 6 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole. Table 4.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) - Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) - Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) - Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) - Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Do not use (5.5) - Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) - Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) - Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 8 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.7), and Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been postmarketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Use in Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and postmarketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: - Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation - Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present - Sinus bradycardia - Existing symptomatic arrhythmias - Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients with Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 5.11 Monitoring Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4) ]."

Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, cyclosporine concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. MethadoneResults based on in vivo clinical study following repeat oral dosing with 400 mg q12h for 1 day, then 200 mg q12h for 4 days voriconazole to subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30 mg to 100 mg q24h) (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed. Fentanyl (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Reduction in the dose of fentanyl and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Alfentanil (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of alfentanil and other opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. A longer period for monitoring respiratory and other opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Oxycodone (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash and visual disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1,655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over 6 months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >= 2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of < 2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients).

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 3 to 5 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole. Table 3.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) - Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) - Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) - Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) - Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) - Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) - Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.7), and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as Torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: -Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation -Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present -Sinus bradycardia -Existing symptomatic arrhythmias -Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients with Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8)]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]."

The metabolism of other proton pump inhibitors that are CYP2C19 substrates may also be inhibited by voriconazole and may result in increased plasma concentrations of other proton pump inhibitors. Other HIV Protease Inhibitors (CYP3A4 Inhibition) In Vivo Studies Showed No Significant Effects on Indinavir Exposure No dosage adjustment for indinavir when coadministered with VFEND In Vitro Studies Demonstrated Potential for Voriconazole to Inhibit Metabolism (Increased Plasma Exposure) Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to other HIV protease inhibitors Other NNRTIsNon-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (CYP3A4 Inhibition) A Voriconazole-Efavirenz Drug Interaction Study Demonstrated the Potential for Voriconazole to Inhibit Metabolism of Other NNRTIs (Increased Plasma Exposure) Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to NNRTI Benzodiazepines (CYP3A4 Inhibition) In Vitro Studies Demonstrated Potential for Voriconazole to Inhibit Metabolism (Increased Plasma Exposure) Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity (i.e., prolonged sedation) related to benzodiazepines metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam). Adjustment of benzodiazepine dosage may be needed. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins) (CYP3A4 Inhibition) In Vitro Studies Demonstrated Potential for Voriconazole to Inhibit Metabolism (Increased Plasma Exposure) Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to statins. Increased statin concentrations in plasma have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. Adjustment of the statin dosage may be needed. Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (CYP3A4 Inhibition) In Vitro Studies Demonstrated Potential for Voriconazole to Inhibit Metabolism (Increased Plasma Exposure) Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers. Adjustment of calcium channel blocker dosage may be needed. Sulfonylurea Oral Hypoglycemics (CYP2C9 Inhibition) Not Studied In Vivo or In Vitro, but Drug Plasma Exposure Likely to be Increased Frequent monitoring of blood glucose and for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. Adjustment of oral hypoglycemic drug dosage may be needed. Vinca Alkaloids (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Not Studied In Vivo or In Vitro, but Drug Plasma Exposure Likely to be Increased Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity (i.e., neurotoxicity) related to vinca alkaloids. Adjustment of vinca alkaloid dosage may be needed. Everolimus (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Not Studied In Vivo or In Vitro, but Drug Plasma Exposure Likely to be Increased Concomitant administration of voriconazole and everolimus is not recommended. CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 inhibitors and inducers: Adjust VFEND dosage and monitor for adverse reactions or lack of efficacy (4, 7) VFEND may increase the concentrations and activity of drugs that are CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates. Reduce dosage of these other drugs and monitor for adverse reactions (4, 7) Phenytoin or Efavirenz: with co-administration, increase maintenance oral and intravenous dosage of VFEND (2.3, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3.0%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see Warning and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 3 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11-90, including 51 patients aged 12-18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 3 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with VFEND. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, VFEND should be discontinued. In addition, VFEND has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during VFEND therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, VFEND should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in <2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1655).

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of VFEND therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during VFEND therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of VFEND must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to VFEND [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 4 to 6 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.5) Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis): Stop the infusion (5.6) Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.12) Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.13) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 8 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with VFEND (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of VFEND therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, VFEND should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.6), and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of VFEND on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Use in Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present Sinus bradycardia Existing symptomatic arrhythmias Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.7 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during VFEND therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.8 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving VFEND [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. VFEND has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). VFEND has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.9 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.10 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.11 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during VFEND treatment. 5.12 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with VFEND. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, VFEND should be discontinued. VFEND has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during VFEND treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and VFEND discontinuation should be considered. If VFEND is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term VFEND therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, VFEND should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.13 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]."

No Significant Effect on Cmax When initiating therapy with VFEND in patients already receiving cyclosporine, reduce the cyclosporine dose to one-half of the starting dose and follow with frequent monitoring of cyclosporine blood levels. Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When VFEND is discontinued, cyclosporine concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. MethadoneResults based on in vivo clinical study following repeat oral dosing with 400 mg Q12h for 1 day, then 200 mg Q12h for 4 days voriconazole to subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30-100 mg QD) (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed Alfentanil (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of alfentanil and other opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with VFEND. A longer period for monitoring respiratory and other opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Drug Interactions). Tacrolimus (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased When initiating therapy with VFEND in patients already receiving tacrolimus, reduce the tacrolimus dose to one-third of the starting dose and follow with frequent monitoring of tacrolimus blood levels. Increased tacrolimus levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When VFEND is discontinued, tacrolimus concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances, fever, rash, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, headache, sepsis, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and respiratory disorder. The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances (see hepatic toxicity under WARNINGS and discussion of Clinical Laboratory Values and dermatological and visual adverse events below). Discussion of Adverse Reactions The data described in Table 13 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11-90, including 51 patients aged 12-18 years), and was 78% white and 10% black. In the initial regulatory filing, 561 patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 13 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. The visual disturbances were generally mild and rarely resulted in discontinuation. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. These events occurred primarily in severely ill patients who had underlying conditions and/or concomitant medications which may have caused or contributed to these events (see WARNINGS). The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS - Information For Patients). Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. In clinical trials, rashes considered related to therapy were reported by 7% (110/1655) of voriconazole-treated patients. The majority of rashes were of mild to moderate severity. Cases of photosensitivity reactions appear to be more likely to occur with long-term treatment. Patients have rarely developed serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme during treatment with VFEND. If patients develop a rash, they should be monitored closely and consideration given to discontinuation of VFEND. It is recommended that patients avoid strong, direct sunlight during VFEND therapy. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in < 2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1655). This listing includes events where a causal relationship to voriconazole cannot be ruled out or those which may help the physician in managing the risks to the patients. The list does not include events included in Table 13 above and does not include every event reported in the voriconazole clinical program.

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of VFEND therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during VFEND therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of VFEND must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to VFEND (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS - Laboratory Tests). Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 14 and 15 and 16 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most frequent common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 orwww.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1,655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13)]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in <2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1,655). This listing includes events where a causal relationship to voriconazole cannot be ruled out or those which may help the physician in managing the risks to the patients. The list does not include events included in Table 2 above and does not include every event reported in the voriconazole clinical program.

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole tablets must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole tablets [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole tablets. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 3 to 5 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) - Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) - Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) - Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) - Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Do not use (5.5) - Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) - Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis): Stop the infusion (5.7) - Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) - Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3)]. Monitoring of hepatic function Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4, 2.7), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (USE IN PREGNANCY) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with these potentially proarrhythmic conditions. Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting voriconazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.7 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.7)]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.8)]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients should avoid intense or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole tablets treatment. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.4)]."

Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, cyclosporine concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. MethadoneResults based on in vivo clinical study following repeat oral dosing with 400 mg q12h for 1 day, then 200 mg q12h for 4 days voriconazole to subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30-100 mg q24h) (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed Fentanyl (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Reduction in the dose of fentanyl and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)] Alfentanil (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of alfentanil and other opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. A longer period for monitoring respiratory and other opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Oxycodone (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)]. NSAIDsNon-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug including. ibuprofen and diclofenac (CYP2C9 Inhibition) Increased Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to NSAIDs. Dose reduction of NSAIDs may be needed [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Tacrolimus (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased When initiating therapy with voriconazole in patients already receiving tacrolimus, reduce the tacrolimus dose to one-third of the starting dose and follow with frequent monitoring of tacrolimus blood levels. Increased tacrolimus levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, tacrolimus concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. Phenytoin (CYP2C9 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Frequent monitoring of phenytoin plasma concentrations and frequent monitoring of adverse effects related to phenytoin. Oral Contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Monitoring for adverse events related to oral contraceptives is recommended during coadministration. Warfarin (CYP2C9 Inhibition) Prothrombin Time Significantly Increased Monitor PT or other suitable anti-coagulation tests. Adjustment of warfarin dosage may be needed. Omeprazole (CYP2C19/3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased When initiating therapy with voriconazole in patients already receiving omeprazole doses of 40 mg or greater, reduce the omeprazole dose by one-half. The metabolism of other proton pump inhibitors that are CYP2C19 substrates may also be inhibited by voriconazole and may result in increased plasma concentrations of other proton pump inhibitors.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Greenstone LLC Professional Information Services at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3.0%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see Warning and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11-90, including 51 patients aged 12-18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in <2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1655).

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 3 to 5 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Do not use (5.5) Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis): Stop the infusion (5.7) Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis reported with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.5), and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Use in Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present Sinus bradycardia Existing symptomatic arrhythmias Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]."

Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, cyclosporine concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. Methadone*** (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed Fentanyl (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Reduction in the dose of fentanyl and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)] Alfentanil (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of alfentanil and other opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. A longer period for monitoring respiratory and other opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. Oxycodone (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most frequent common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1,655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13)]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in <2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1,655). This listing includes events where a causal relationship to voriconazole cannot be ruled out or those which may help the physician in managing the risks to the patients.

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole tablets must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole tablets [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole tablets. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 3 to 5 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.14)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) -Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) -Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) -Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) -Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Do not use (5.5) -Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) -Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis): Stop the infusion (5.7) -Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) -Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3)]. Monitoring of hepatic function Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4, 2.7), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (USE IN PREGNANCY) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with these potentially proarrhythmic conditions. Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting voriconazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.7 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.7)]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.8)]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients should avoid intense or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole tablets treatment. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.4)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most frequent (all causalities, incidence >= 2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3.0%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash and visual disturbances [see Warning and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2 , 6.3) ]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1,655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years) and was 78% white and 10% black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over 6 months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >= 2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of < 2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below. Table 2.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings an Precautions (5) ]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in < 2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (n = 1,655). This listing includes events where a causal relationship to voriconazole cannot be ruled out or those which may help the physician in managing the risks to the patients.

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 3 to 5 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole. Table 3.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions (5.1): review patient's concomitant medications. Several drugs may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Voriconazole may alter PK or PD of several drugs (7) Hepatic Toxicity (5.2): serious hepatic reactions have been reported. Evaluate liver function tests at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Visual Disturbances (5.3): monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days Pregnancy Category D (5.4): do not administer to pregnant women Galactose Intolerance (5.5): do not administer to patients with galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation (5.6): administer with caution to patients with proarrhythmic conditions Dermatological Reactions (5.13): exfoliative cutaneous reactions and photosensitivity have been reported Skeletal Events (5.14): fluorosis and periostitis have been reported with long-term voriconazole therapy 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. Monitoring of Hepatic Function Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.7) and Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.4 Pregnancy Category D Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with these potentially proarrhythmic conditions. Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients with Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients should avoid intense or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4) ]."

Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When VFEND is discontinued, cyclosporine concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. MethadoneResults based on in vivo clinical study following repeat oral dosing with 400 mg q12h for 1 day, then 200 mg q12h for 4 days voriconazole to subjects receiving a methadone maintenance dose (30-100 mg q24h) (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed Fentanyl (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Reduction in the dose of fentanyl and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with VFEND. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)] Alfentanil (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of alfentanil and other opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with VFEND. A longer period for monitoring respiratory and other opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Oxycodone (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with VFEND. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see Drug Interactions (7)]. NSAIDsNon-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug including. ibuprofen and diclofenac (CYP2C9 Inhibition) Increased Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to NSAIDs. Dose reduction of NSAIDs may be needed [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Tacrolimus (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased When initiating therapy with VFEND in patients already receiving tacrolimus, reduce the tacrolimus dose to one-third of the starting dose and follow with frequent monitoring of tacrolimus blood levels. Increased tacrolimus levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When VFEND is discontinued, tacrolimus concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. Phenytoin (CYP2C9 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Frequent monitoring of phenytoin plasma concentrations and frequent monitoring of adverse effects related to phenytoin. Oral Contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Monitoring for adverse events related to oral contraceptives is recommended during coadministration.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3.0%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see Warning and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 3 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11-90, including 51 patients aged 12-18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 3 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients).

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with VFEND. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, VFEND should be discontinued. In addition, VFEND has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during VFEND therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, VFEND should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of VFEND therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during VFEND therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of VFEND must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to VFEND [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 4 to 6 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.5) Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis): Stop the infusion (5.6) Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.12) Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.13) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 8 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with VFEND (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of VFEND therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, VFEND should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.6), and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of VFEND on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Use in Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present Sinus bradycardia Existing symptomatic arrhythmias Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.6 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.7 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during VFEND therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.8 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving VFEND [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. VFEND has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). VFEND has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.9 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.10 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.11 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during VFEND treatment. 5.12 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with VFEND. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, VFEND should be discontinued. VFEND has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during VFEND treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and VFEND discontinuation should be considered. If VFEND is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term VFEND therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, VFEND should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.13 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]."

Increased cyclosporine levels have been associated with nephrotoxicity. When voriconazole is discontinued, cyclosporine concentrations must be frequently monitored and the dose increased as necessary. Methadone*** (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Increased plasma concentrations of methadone have been associated with toxicity including QT prolongation. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to methadone is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of methadone may be needed Fentanyl (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Increased Reduction in the dose of fentanyl and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)] Alfentanil (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of alfentanil and other opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil) should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. A longer period for monitoring respiratory and other opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. Oxycodone (CYP3A4 Inhibition) Significantly Increased Reduction in the dose of oxycodone and other long-acting opiates metabolized by CYP3A4 should be considered when coadministered with voriconazole. Extended and frequent monitoring for opiate-associated adverse events may be necessary [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1,655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13)]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in <2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1,655). This listing includes events where a causal relationship to voriconazole cannot be ruled out or those which may help the physician in managing the risks to the patients. The list does not include events included in Table 2 above and does not include every event reported in the voriconazole clinical program.

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole tablets must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole tablets [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 3 to 5 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.14)]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) - Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) - Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) - Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) - Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Do not use (5.5) - Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) - Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis): Stop the infusion (5.7) - Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) - Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3)]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4, 2.7), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (USE IN PREGNANCY) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as. -Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation -Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present -Sinus bradycardia -Existing symptomatic arrhythmias -Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7), and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.7 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.7)]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.8)]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.4)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2,6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 3 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 3 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below. Table 3.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13)]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in < 2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1655).

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 4 to 6 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole. Table 4.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.14 )]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) - Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) - Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) - Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) - Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) - Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis): Stop the infusion (5.7) - Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) - Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 8 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3)]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4, 2.7), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3 )]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Use in Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: -Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation -Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present -Sinus bradycardia -Existing symptomatic arrhythmias -Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7), and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.7 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.7)]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.8)]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.4)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1,655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13)]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in <2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1,655). This listing includes events where a causal relationship to voriconazole cannot be ruled out or those which may help the physician in managing the risks to the patients. The list does not include events included in Table 2 above and does not include every event reported in the voriconazole clinical program.

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole tablets must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole tablets [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 3 to 5 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3)]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9), DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4, 2.7), and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (USE IN PREGNANCY) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: - Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation - Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present - Sinus bradycardia - Existing symptomatic arrhythmias - Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7), and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.7 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.7)]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3), and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.8)]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.4)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >=2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash and visual disturbances [see Warning and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3) ]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >=2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in <2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1655).

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 3 to 5 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.7), and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Use in Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present Sinus bradycardia Existing symptomatic arrhythmias Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >= 2%): visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, headache, liver function test abnormal, tachycardia, hallucinations (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overview The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see Warning and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults The data described in Table 3 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 3 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of >= 2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of < 2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients).

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. There have been postmarketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28 day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown. Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse events occurred in < 2% of all voriconazole treated patients in all therapeutic studies (n = 1655).

Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. Tables 4 to 6 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with esophageal candidiasis were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable invasive aspergillosis were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skeletal: fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Clinically Significant Drug Interactions: Review patient's concomitant medications (5.1, 7) - Hepatic Toxicity: Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy (5.2) - Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days (5.3) - Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: do not administer to pregnant women unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Inform pregnant patient of hazard (5.4, 8.1) - Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Do not use (5.5) - Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation: Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions (5.6) - Infusion Related Reactions (including anaphylaxis): Stop the infusion (5.7) - Dermatological Reactions: Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions or phototoxicity. Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity (5.13) - Skeletal Events: Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these events occur (5.14) 5.1 Drug Interactions See Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 8 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.7), and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.3 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been postmarketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Use in Pregnancy) for additional details. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.6 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and postmarketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: - Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation - Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present - Sinus bradycardia - Existing symptomatic arrhythmias - Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Infusion Related Reactions During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur. 5.8 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.9 Patients With Hepatic Impairment It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity. 5.10 Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8)]. 5.11 Monitoring of Renal Function Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine. 5.12 Monitoring of Pancreatic Function Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 5.13 Dermatological Reactions Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued. Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.14 Skeletal Adverse Events Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]."
