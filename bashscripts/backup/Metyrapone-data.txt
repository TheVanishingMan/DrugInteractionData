      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Drugs affecting pituitary or adrenocortical function, including all corticosteroid therapy, must be discontinued prior to and during testing with Metopirone. The metabolism of Metopirone is accelerated by phenytoin; therefore, results of the test may be inaccurate in patients taking phenytoin within two weeks before. A subnormal response may occur in patients on estrogen therapy. Metopirone inhibits the glucuronidation of acetaminophen and could possibly potentiate acetaminophen toxicity."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Cardiovascular System: Hypotension. Gastrointestinal System: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort or pain. Central Nervous System: Headache, dizziness, sedation. Dermatologic System: Allergic rash. Hematologic System: Rarely, decreased white blood cell count or bone marrow depression."
