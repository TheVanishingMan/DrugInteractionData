        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious side effect is respiratory depression. Because of delay in maximum CNS effect with intravenously administered drug (30 min), rapid administration may result in overdosing. Bolus administration by the epidural or intrathecal route may result in early respiratory depression due to direct venous redistribution of morphine to the respiratory centers in the brain. Late (up to 24 hours) onset of acute respiratory depression has been reported with administration by the epidural or intrathecal route and is believed to be the result of rostral spread. Reports of respiratory depression following intrathecal administration have been more frequent, but the dosage used in most of these cases has been considerably higher than that recommended. This depression may be severe and could require intervention (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE). Even without clinical evidence of ventilatory inadequacy, a diminished CO2 ventilation response may be noted for up to 22 hours following epidural or intrathecal administration. While low doses of intravenously administered morphine have little effect on cardiovascular stability, high doses are excitatory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and an increase in circulating catecholamines. Excitation of the central nervous system resulting in convulsions may accompany high doses of morphine given intravenously. Dysphoric reactions may occur and toxic psychoses have been reported. Epidural or intrathecal administration is accompanied by a high incidence of pruritus which is dose related but not confined to site of administration. Nausea and vomiting are frequently seen in patients following morphine administration. Urinary retention which may persist for 10 to 20 hours following single epidural or intrathecal administration has been reported in approximately 90% of males. Incidence is somewhat lower in females. Patients may require catheterization (see PRECAUTIONS). Pruritus, nausea/vomiting and urinary retention frequently can be alleviated by the intravenous administration of low doses of naloxone (0.2 mg). Tolerance and dependence to chronically administered morphine, by whatever route, is known to occur (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE). Miscellaneous side effects include constipation, headache, anxiety, depression of cough reflex, interference with thermal regulation and oliguria. Evidence of histamine release such as urticaria, wheals and/or local tissue irritation may occur. In general, side effects are amenable to reversal by narcotic antagonists. NALOXONE HYDROCHLORIDE INJECTION AND RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR ADMINISTRATION IN CASE OF LIFE-THREATENING OR INTOLERABLE SIDE EFFECTS."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The major hazards of morphine, as with other narcotic analgesics, are respiratory depression, and to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest have occurred, particularly with overdosage, rapid intravenous administration, and pre-existing hypovolemic shock. Rarely, anaphylactoid reactions have been reported when morphine or other phenanthrene alkaloids of opium are administered intravenously. The most frequently observed adverse reactions include sedation, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not experiencing severe pain. Some adverse reactions in ambulatory patients may be alleviated if the patient lies down (see also PRECAUTIONS "Hypotensive Effect"). Other possible adverse reactions include: Central Nervous System - Euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, headache, agitation, tremor, uncoordinated muscle movements, visual disturbances, transient hallucinations and disorientation. Gastrointestinal - Constipation, biliary tract spasm. Cardiovascular - Tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, syncope, and orthostatic hypotension. Genitourinary - Oliguria and urinary retention; an antidiuretic effect has been reported. Allergic - Allergic reactions to opiates occur infrequently; pruritus, urticaria and other skin rashes are most common. Rarely, anaphylactoid reactions have been reported following intravenous administration. Other - Opiate-induced histamine release may be responsible for the flushing of the face, sweating, and pruritus often seen with these drugs. Wheals and urticaria at the site of injection are probably related to histamine release. Local tissue irritation, pain and induration have been reported following repeated subcutaneous injection. Morphine, like other opioids, may alter temperature regulation in susceptible individuals and will depress the cough reflex."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CNS depressants: May increase the risk of respiratory depression (7.1) Muscle relaxants: May enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce respiratory depression (7.2) Mixed agonist/antagonist opioid analgesics: May reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms (7.3) Cimetidine: May increase respiratory and CNS depression (7.4) Anticholinergics: May increase the risk of urinary retention, severe constipation, or paralytic ileus (7.6) 7.1 Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Morphine should be administered cautiously to avoid additive effects when other central nervous system depressants, including other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, antiemetics, and alcohol are given concomitantly. When given concomitantly the risks of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation and coma are increased. 7.2 Muscle Relaxants Morphine sulfate may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. 7.3 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics Do not administer mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) to patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as morphine sulfate injection. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 7.4 Cimetidine Concomitant administration of morphine sulfate injection and cimetidine has been reported to precipitate apnea, confusion, and muscle twitching in an isolated report. Monitor patients for increased respiratory and CNS depression when receiving cimetidine concomitantly with morphine sulfate injection. 7.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) MAOIs markedly potentiate the action of morphine sulfate injection. Allow at least 14 days after stopping treatment with MAOIs before initiating treatment with morphine sulfate injection. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention, severe constipation, or paralyltic ileus."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dosing errors: Take care when prescribing and administering to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between different concentrations and between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. (5.1) Cardiovascular instability: High doses are excitatory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and increase in circulatory catecholamine (5.2) Respiratory depression: Rapid intravenous administration may result in chest wall rigidity (5.3) CNS toxicity: High doses are excitatory, resulting in convulsions (5.4) CNS Depressants: May increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, sedation, coma, or death if used in conjunction with other CNS active drugs (5.6) Increased intracranial pressure or head injury: May increase respiratory depressant effects and elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (5.7) Hypotensive effect: May cause hypotension in ambulatory patients (5.8) Gastrointestinal effects: May diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract and prolong obstruction (5.10) Biliary surgery or disorders of biliary tract: May cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and diminish biliary and pancreatic secretions (5.11) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Morphine sulfate injection is available in three concentrations for direct injection. Take care when prescribing and administering morphine sulfate injection to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between different concentrations and between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Take care to ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume. 5.2 Cardiovascular Instability While low doses of intravenously administered morphine have little effect on cardiovascular stability, high doses are excitatory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and increase in circulatory catecholamines. Have naloxone injection and resuscitative equipment immediately available for use in case of life-threatening or intolerable side effects and whenever morphine therapy is being initiated. 5.3 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the primary risk of morphine sulfate injection. Respiratory depression occurs more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients and in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or upper airway obstruction, in whom even moderate therapeutic doses may significantly decrease pulmonary ventilation. Morphine administration should be limited to use by those familiar with the management of respiratory depression. Rapid intravenous administration may result in chest wall rigidity. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve (e.g., severe kyphoscoliosis), hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression have an increased risk of increased airway resistance and decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea with use of morphine sulfate injection. Therefore, consider alternative non-opioid analgesics, and use morphine sulfate injection only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.4 Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity Excitation of the central nervous system, resulting in convulsion, may accompany high doses of morphine given intravenously. Dysphoric reactions may occur after any size dose and toxic psychoses have been reported. 5.5 Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Morphine sulfate is an opioid agonist and Schedule II controlled substance. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders. Diversion of Schedule II products is an act subject to criminal penalty. [See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9).] Morphine sulfate can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing morphine sulfate injection in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State of Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.6 Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants The depressant effects of morphine are potentiated by the presence of other CNS depressants such as alcohol, sedatives, antihistamines, or psychotropic drugs. Use of morphine in conjunction with other CNS active drugs may increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma, or death. 5.7 Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Injury Use morphine sulfate injection with extreme caution in patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure. In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the possible respiratory depressant effects of morphine sulfate injection and its potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Pupillary changes (miosis) from morphine may obscure the existence, extent and course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reactions when evaluating altered mental status or movement abnormalities in patients receiving this modality of treatment. 5.8 Hypotensive Effect Morphine sulfate injection may cause severe hypotension in an individual whose ability to maintain their blood pressure has been compromised by depleted blood volume, shock, impaired myocardial function or concurrent administration of sympatholytic drugs, and drugs such as phenothiazines or general anesthetics. Orthostatic hypotension is a frequent complication in single-dose parenteral morphine analgesia in ambulatory patients. The vasodilation produced by morphine sulfate injection may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure in patients in circulatory shock. 5.9 Driving and Operating Machinery Morphine may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients accordingly. 5.10 Gastrointestinal Effects Do not administer morphine sulfate injection to patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus because morphine sulfate injection diminishes propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract and may prolong the obstruction. The administration of morphine sulfate injection may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal condition. 5.11 Use in Biliary Surgery or Disorders of the Biliary Tract Morphine sulfate injection may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and diminish biliary and pancreatic secretions. 5.12 Special Risk Groups Use morphine sulfate injection with caution and in reduced dosages in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment, Addison's disease, hypothyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture, and in elderly or debilitated patients. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.5).] Exercise caution in the administration of morphine sulfate injection to patients with CNS depression, toxic psychosis, acute alcoholism and delirium tremens."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with EMBEDA because they may reduce analgesic effect of EMBEDA or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.11, 7.3) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid EMBEDA in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.5) 7.1 Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with EMBEDA can result in an increase of morphine plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of morphine. Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on EMBEDA therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of EMBEDA with other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and EMBEDA for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 7.3 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of EMBEDA and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving EMBEDA. 7.4 Muscle Relaxants Opioids may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and EMBEDA for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) The effects of morphine may be potentiated by MAOIs. Monitor patients on concurrent therapy with an MAOI and EMBEDA for increased respiratory and central nervous system depression. MAOIs have been reported to potentiate the effects of morphine anxiety, confusion, and significant depression of respiration or coma. EMBEDA should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. 7.6 Cimetidine Cimetidine can potentiate morphine-induced respiratory depression. There is a report of confusion and severe respiratory depression when a patient undergoing hemodialysis was concurrently administered morphine and cimetidine. Monitor patients for respiratory depression when EMBEDA and cimetidine are used concurrently. 7.7 Diuretics Morphine can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Morphine may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.8 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other drugs with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when EMBEDA is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs. 7.9 P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) Inhibitors P-gp inhibitors (e.g., quinidine) may increase the absorption/exposure of morphine by about two-fold. Monitor patients for signs of respiratory and CNS depression when P-gp inhibitors are used concurrently with EMBEDA."

Short-Term Randomized Study This study utilized an enriched enrollment with a randomized withdrawal design in which subjects were titrated to effect on open-label EMBEDA for up to 45 days. Once their pain was controlled, 344 of 547 subjects were randomized to either an active treatment with EMBEDA or were tapered off EMBEDA using a double-dummy design and placed on placebo. The maintenance Period was 12 weeks. Adverse reactions, reported in >=2% of subjects in either the titration or maintenance phase of the 12-week study are presented in Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If coadministration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive pharmacological effects. (5.4, 7.2) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.7) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of EMBEDA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse EMBEDA contains morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, EMBEDA exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ]. As modified-release products such as EMBEDA deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of morphine present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed EMBEDA and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing EMBEDA, and monitor all patients receiving EMBEDA for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of EMBEDA for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as EMBEDA, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of EMBEDA along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of EMBEDA by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the morphine and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10) ]. Misuse or abuse of EMBEDA by these methods may also release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]. Opioid agonists such as EMBEDA are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing EMBEDA. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10) ]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of EMBEDA, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with EMBEDA and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of EMBEDA are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Overestimating the EMBEDA dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of EMBEDA, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of morphine. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of EMBEDA during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of drug elimination by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on EMBEDA therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with EMBEDA may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of morphine. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if EMBEDA is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of EMBEDA in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin EMBEDA is made, start with EMBEDA 20 mg/0.8 mg every 24 hours, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating EMBEDA and when EMBEDA is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with EMBEDA, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of EMBEDA may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Hypotensive Effect EMBEDA may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of EMBEDA. In patients with circulatory shock, EMBEDA may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of EMBEDA in patients with circulatory shock. 5.8 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking EMBEDA who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with EMBEDA. EMBEDA may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of EMBEDA in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.9 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions EMBEDA is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of EMBEDA in patients with other GI obstruction. The morphine in EMBEDA may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. 5.10 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The morphine in EMBEDA may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during EMBEDA therapy. 5.11 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including EMBEDA. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Consuming EMBEDA capsules that have been altered by crushing, chewing, or dissolving the pellets can release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals. Symptoms of withdrawal usually appear within five minutes of ingestion of naltrexone and can last for up to 48 hours. Mental status changes can include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea can require intravenous (IV) fluid administration. When discontinuing EMBEDA, gradually taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Do not abruptly discontinue EMBEDA. 5.12 Driving and Operating Machinery EMBEDA may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of EMBEDA and know how they will react to the medication. 5.13 Interference with Laboratory Tests Naltrexone does not interfere with thin-layer, gas-liquid, and high performance liquid chromatographic methods which may be used for the separation and detection of morphine, methadone, or quinine in the urine. Naltrexone may or may not interfere with enzymatic methods for the detection of opioids depending on the specificity of the test. Consult the test manufacturer for specific details."

        "Drug Interactions Morphine should be administered cautiously and in reduced dosage to avoid additive effects when other central nervous system depressants, including other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothlazines, tricyclic antidepressants, tranquilizers or alcohol, are given concomitantly. Virtually all drug interactions involving MAO inhibitors and narcotic analgesics have been reported with meperidine, which is contraindicated in such patients. In patients receiving MAO inhibitors, therefore, before initiating therapy with other narcotic analgesics, including morphine, an initial small test dose is advisable to allow observation of excessive narcotic effects or MAOI interaction."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The major hazards of morphine, as with other narcotic analgesics, are respiratory depression, and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression; respiratory arrest, shock and cardiac arrest have occurred, particularly with overdosage or rapid intravenous administration. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported when morphine or other phenanthrene alkaloids of opium are administered intravenously. The most frequently observed adverse reactions include sedation, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not experiencing severe pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable. Some adverse reactions in ambulatory patients may be alleviated if the patient lies down. Central Nervous System - Euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, headache, agitation, tremor, uncoordinated muscle movements, transient hallucinations and disorientation, visual disturbances. Gastrointestinal - Constipation, biliary tract spasm. Patients with chronic ulcerative colitis may experience increased colonic motility; in patients with acute ulcerative colitis, toxic dilation has been reported. Cardiovascular - Tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, syncope and orthostatic hypotension. Genitourinary - Narcotic analgesics may cause oliguria and urinary retention. Allergic - Allergic reactions to opiates occur infrequently; pruritus, urticaria and other skin rashes are common. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported following intravenous administration. Other - Opiate-induced histamine release may be responsible for the flushing of the face, sweating and pruritus often seen with these drugs. Wheals and urticaria at the site of injection are probably related to histamine release. Local tissue irritation, pain and induration have been reported following repeated subcutaneous injection."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dosing errors: Take care when prescribing and administering to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between different concentrations and between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death.(5.1) Cardiovascular instability: High doses are excitatory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and increase in circulatory catecholamine. (5.2) Respiratory depression: Rapid intravenous administration may result in chest wall rigidity (5.3) CNS toxicity: High doses are excitatory, resulting in convulsions (5.4) CNS Depressants: May increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, sedation, coma, or death if used in conjunction with other CNS active drugs (5.6) Increased intracranial pressure of head injury: May increase respiratory depressant effects and elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (5.7) Hypotensive effect: May cause hypotension in ambulatory patients (5.8) Gastrointestinal effects: May diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract and prolong obstruction (5.10) Biliary surgery or disorders of biliary tract: May cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and diminish biliary and pancreatic secretions (5.11) 5.1 Risk of Medication Errors Morphine Sulfate Injection is available in five concentrations for direct injection. Take care when prescribing and administering Morphine Sulfate Injection to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between different concentrations and between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Take care to ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume. 5.2 Cardiovascular Instability While low doses of intravenously administered morphine have little effect on cardiovascular stability, high doses are excitory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and increase in circulatory catecholamines. Have Naloxone Injection and resuscitative equipment immediately available for use in case of life-threatening or intolerable side effects and whenever morphine therapy is being initiated. 5.3 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the primary risk of Morphine Sulfate Injection USP. Respiratory depression occurs more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients and in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia or upper airway obstruction, in whom even moderate therapeutic doses may significantly decrease pulmonary ventilation. Morphine administration should be limited to use by those familiar with the management of respiratory depression. Rapid intravenous administration may result in chest wall rigidity. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve (e.g., severe kyphoscoliosis), hypoxia, hypercapnia or pre-existing respiratory depression have an increased risk of increased airway resistance and decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea with use of Morphine Sulfate Injection USP. Therefore, consider alternative non-opioid analgesics, and use Morphine Sulfate Injection USP only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.4 Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity Excitation of the central nervous system, resulting in convulsion, may accompany high doses of morphine given intravenously. Dysphoric reactions may occur after any size dose and toxic psychoses have been reported. 5.5 Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Morphine sulfate is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders. Diversion of Schedule II products is an act subject to criminal penalty. [See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] Morphine sulfate can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing Morphine Sulfate Injection USP in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or diversion. Concerns about abuse, addiction and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.6 Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants The depressant effects of morphine are potentiated by the presence of other CNS depressants such as alcohol, sedatives, antihistamines or psychotropic drugs. Use of morphine in conjunction with other CNS active drugs may increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma, or death. 5.7 Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Injury Use Morphine Sulfate Injection with extreme caution in patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure. In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the possible respiratory depressant effects of Morphine Sulfate Injection USP and its potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Pupillary changes (miosis) from morphine may obscure the existence, extent and course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reactions when evaluating altered mental status or movement abnormalities in patients receiving this modality of treatment. 5.8 Hypotensive Effect Morphine sulfate may cause severe hypotension in an individual whose ability to maintain their blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, shock, impaired myocardial function or concurrent administration of sympatholytic drugs, and drugs such as phenothiazines or general anesthetics. Orthostatic hypotension is a frequent complication in single-dose parenteral morphine analgesia in ambulatory patients. The vasodilation produced by Morphine Sulfate Injection USP may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure in patients in circulatory shock. 5.9 Driving and Operating Machinery Morphine may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients accordingly. 5.10 Gastrointestinal Effects Do not administer Morphine Sulfate Injection USP to patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus because Morphine Sulfate Injection USP diminishes propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract and may prolong the obstruction. The administration of Morphine Sulfate Injection USP may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal condition. 5.11 Use in Biliary Surgery or Disorders of the Biliary Tract Morphine sulfate should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, as morphine sulfate may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and diminish biliary and pancreatic secretions. 5.13 Exposure, Hypothermia, Immersion and Shock Caution must be used when injecting any opioid intramuscularly into chilled areas or in patients with hypotension or shock, since impaired perfusion may prevent complete absorption; if repeated injections are administered, an excessive amount may be suddenly absorbed if normal circulation is re-established. 5.14 Special Risk Groups Use Morphine Sulfate injection in reduced dosages in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment, Addison's disease, hypothyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture, and in elderly or debilitated patients. Monitor these patients closely for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression. [See Use in Specific Populations (8)]"

[ See Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) .] Morphine sulfate can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing Morphine Sulfate Injection USP in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State of Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.6 Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants The depressant effects of morphine are potentiated by the presence of other CNS depressants such as alcohol, sedatives, antihistamines, or psychotropic drugs. Use of Morphine in conjunction with other CNS active drugs may increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma, or death. 5.7 Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Injury Use Morphine Sulfate Injection with extreme caution in patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure. In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the possible respiratory depressant effects of Morphine Sulfate Injection USP and its potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Pupillary changes (miosis) from morphine may obscure the existence, extent and course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reactions when evaluating altered mental status or movement abnormalities in patients receiving this modality of treatment. 5.8 Hypotensive Effect Morphine Sulfate Injection may cause severe hypotension in an individual whose ability to maintain their blood pressure has been compromised by depleted blood volume, shock, impaired myocardial function or concurrent administration of sympatholytic drugs, and drugs such as phenothiazines or general anesthetics. Orthostatic hypotension is a frequent complication in single-dose parenteral morphine analgesia in ambulatory patients. The vasodilation produced by Morphine Sulfate Injection USP may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure in patients in circulatory shock. 5.9 Driving and Operating Machinery Morphine may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Caution patients accordingly. 5.10 Gastrointestinal Effects Do not administer Morphine Sulfate Injection USP to patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus because Morphine Sulfate Injection USP diminishes propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract and may prolong the obstruction. The administration of Morphine Sulfate Injection USP may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal condition. 5.11 Use in Biliary Surgery or Disorders of the Biliary Tract Morphine Sulfate Injection USP may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and diminish biliary and pancreatic secretions. 5.12 Special Risk Groups Use Morphine Sulfate Injection USP with caution and in reduced dosages in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment, Addison's disease, hypothyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture, and in elderly or debilitated patients. [ See Use in Specific Populations (8.5) .] Exercise caution in the administration of Morphine Sulfate Injection USP to patients with CNS depression, toxic psychosis, acute alcoholism and delirium tremens.",

Drug Abuse and Dependence Controlled Substance: Morphine sulfate is a Schedule II narcotic. Dependence: Morphine can produce drug dependence and, therefore, has the potential for being abused. Patients receiving therapeutic dosage regimens of 10 mg every 4 hours for 1 to 2 weeks have exhibited mild withdrawal symptoms. Dependence is recognizable by an increased tolerance to the analgesic effect and the appearance of purposive phenomena (complaints, pleas, demands, or manipulative actions) shortly before the time of the next scheduled dose. Withdrawal should be treated in a hospital. Usually, it is necessary only to provide supportive care with administration of a tranquilizer to suppress anxiety. Severe symptoms of withdrawal may require administration of a replacement narcotic."

Premedication or intra-anesthetic use of neuroleptics with morphine may increase the risk of respiratory depression."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious side effect is respiratory depression. Because of delay in maximum CNS effect with intravenously administered drug (30 min), rapid administration may result in overdosing. (See WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE. ) While low doses of intravenously administered morphine have little effect on cardiovascular stability, high doses are excitatory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and an increase in circulating catecholamines. Excitation of the central nervous system resulting in convulsions may accompany high doses of morphine given intravenously. Dysphoric reactions may occur and toxic psychoses have been reported. Nausea and vomiting are frequently seen in patients following morphine administration. Pruritus and nausea/vomiting frequently can be alleviated by the intravenous administration of low doses of naloxone (0.2 mg). Tolerance and dependence to chronically administered morphine, by whatever route, is known to occur (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ). Miscellaneous side effects include constipation, headache, anxiety, depression of cough reflex, interference with thermal regulation and oliguria. Evidence of histamine release such as urticaria, wheals and/or local tissue irritation may occur. In general, side effects are amenable to reversal by narcotic antagonists. NALOXONE HYDROCHLORIDE INJECTION AND RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR ADMINISTRATION IN CASE OF LIFE-THREATENING OR INTOLERABLE SIDE EFFECTS."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS IMPROPER OR ERRONEOUS SUBSTITUTION OF INFUMORPH 200 or 500 (10 or 25 mg/mL, respectively) FOR REGULAR DURAMORPH (0.5 or 1 mg/mL) IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN SERIOUS OVERDOSAGE, LEADING TO SEIZURES, RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND, POSSIBLY, FATAL OUTCOME. The most serious adverse experiences encountered during continuous intrathecal or epidural infusion of INFUMORPH are respiratory depression, myoclonus, and formation of inflammatory masses. Single-dose neuraxial administration may result in acute or delayed respiratory depression for periods at least as long as 24 hours. Severe respiratory depression, potentially life-threatening, can result from technical errors during refill, e.g., injection of INFUMORPH outside the filling port, unintentional injection into the direct bypass-dosing port featured on some devices or local infiltration. Tolerance and myoclonus: See WARNINGS for discussion of these and related hazards. Inflammatory masses: See WARNINGS . While low doses of intravenously administered morphine have little effect on cardiovascular stability, high doses are excitatory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and increase in circulating catecholamines. Excitation of the central nervous system, resulting in convulsions, may accompany high doses of morphine given intravenously. Dysphoric reactions may occur after any size dose and toxic psychoses have been reported. Pruritus: Single-dose epidural or intrathecal administration is accompanied by a high incidence of pruritus that is dose-related but not confined to the site of administration. Pruritus, following continuous infusion of epidural or intrathecal morphine, is occasionally reported in the literature; these reactions are poorly understood as to their cause. Urinary Retention: Urinary retention, which may persist 10 to 20 hours following single epidural or intrathecal administration, is a frequent side effect and must be anticipated primarily in male patients, with a somewhat lower incidence in females. Also frequently reported in the literature is the occurrence of urinary retention during the first several days of hospitalization for the initiation of continuous intrathecal or epidural morphine therapy. Patients who develop urinary retention have responded to cholinomimetic treatment and/or judicious use of catheters (see PRECAUTIONS ). Constipation: Constipation is frequently encountered during continuous infusion of morphine; this can usually be managed by conventional therapy. Headache: Lumbar puncture-type headache is encountered in a significant minority of cases for several days following intrathecal catheter implantation; this, generally, responds to bed rest and/or other conventional therapy. Peripheral Edema: There are several reports of peripheral edema, including unexplained genital swelling in male patients, following infusion-device implant surgery. Other: Other adverse experiences reported following morphine therapy include — Dizziness, euphoria, anxiety, depression of cough reflex, interference with thermal regulation and oliguria. Evidence of histamine release such as urticaria, wheals and/or local tissue irritation may occur. Pruritus, nausea/vomiting and urinary retention, if associated with continuous infusion therapy, may respond to intravenous administration of a low dose of naloxone (0.2 mg). The risks of using narcotic antagonists in patients chronically receiving narcotic therapy should be considered. NALOXONE INJECTION AND RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR USE IN CASE OF LIFE-THREATENING OR INTOLERABLE SIDE EFFECTS AND WHENEVER INFUMORPH THERAPY IS BEING INITIATED, THE RESERVOIR IS BEING REFILLED OR ANY MANIPULATION OF THE RESERVOIR SYSTEM IS TAKING PLACE."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONSSerious adverse reactions that may be associated with EMBEDA therapy in clinical use include: respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, apnea, circulatory depression, cardiac arrest, hypotension, and/or shock [see OVERDOSAGE (10), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5)]. The common adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with EMBEDA are dose dependent, and their frequency depends on the clinical setting, the patient's level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. They should be expected and managed as a part of opioid analgesia. The most frequent of these include drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and nausea. 6.1 Clinical Studies ExperienceBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There were 1251 subjects exposed to at least one dose of EMBEDA in the clinical program. During late phase clinical development, 618 subjects received EMBEDA in two randomized, controlled, double-blind studies in subjects with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. An additional 465 subjects received EMBEDA in an open-label, year-long safety study of subjects with chronic, non-cancer pain, 208 subjects for at least six months and 124 for 12 months. The remaining 168 subjects were exposed to a single dose of EMBEDA in early PK/PD studies. Short-Term (12-Week) Randomized Study Adverse reactions observed in at least 2% of subjects treated with EMBEDA This study utilized an enriched enrollment with a randomized withdrawal design in which subjects were titrated to effect on open-label EMBEDA for up to 45 days. Once their pain was controlled, subjects were randomized to either active treatment with EMBEDA or were tapered off EMBEDA using a double-dummy design and placed on placebo. The Maintenance Period was 12 weeks. The most common adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation were nausea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, pruritus, and somnolence. Adverse reactions, defined as treatment-related adverse events assessed by the investigators, reported by greater than or equal to 2.0% of subjects in either the titration or maintenance phase of the 12-week study are presented in Table 1. Long-Term Open-Label Safety Study In the long-term open-label safety study, 465 patients with chronic non-malignant pain were enrolled and 124 patients were treated for up to 1 year. The distributions of adverse events were similar to that of the randomized, controlled studies, and were consistent with the most common opioid related adverse events. Adverse reactions, defined as treatment-related adverse events assessed by the investigators, reported by greater than or equal to 2.0% of subjects are presented in Table 2. Adverse Reactions Observed in the Phase 2/3 Studies Most common (greater than 10%): constipation, nausea, somnolence Common (greater than or equal to 1% to less than 10%): vomiting, headache, dizziness, pruritus, dry mouth, diarrhea, fatigue, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, anxiety, chills, abdominal pain, lethargy, edema peripheral, dyspepsia, anorexia, muscle spasms, depression, flatulence, restlessness, decreased appetite, irritability, stomach discomfort, tremor, arthralgia, hot flush, sedation Adverse Reactions Observed in the Phase 2/3 Studies Most common (greater than or equal to 10%): Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, nausea; Nervous system disorders: somnolence. Common (greater than or equal to 1% to less than 10%): Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence, stomach discomfort, vomiting; General disorders and administration site conditions: chills, edema peripheral, fatigue, irritability; Metabolism and nutrition disorders: anorexia, decreased appetite; Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, muscle spasms; Nervous system disorders: dizziness, headache, lethargy, sedation, tremor; Psychiatric disorders: anxiety, depression, insomnia, restlessness; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: hyperhidrosis, pruritus; Vascular disorders: hot flush. Less Common (less than 1%): Eye disorders: vision blurred, orthostatic hypotension; Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, pancreatitis, abdominal discomfort, fecaloma, abdominal pain lower, abdominal tenderness; General disorders and administration site conditions: malaise, asthenia, feeling jittery, drug withdrawal syndrome; Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis; Investigations: alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased; Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia, muscular weakness; Nervous system disorders: depressed level of consciousness, mental impairment, memory impairment, disturbance in attention, stupor, paraesthesia, coordination abnormal; Psychiatric disorders: disorientation, thinking abnormal, mental status changes, confusional state, euphoric mood, hallucination, abnormal dreams, mood swings, nervousness; Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, dysuria; Reproductive system and breast disorders: erectile dysfunction; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea, rhinorrhoea; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, piloerection, cold sweat, night sweats; Vascular disorders: hypotension, flushing."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS EMBEDA is to be swallowed whole or the contents of the capsules sprinkled on apple sauce. The pellets in the capsules are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed. The resulting morphine dose may be fatal, particularly in opioid-naive individuals. In opioid-tolerant individuals, the absorption of naltrexone may increase the risk of precipitating withdrawal. EMBEDA 100 mg/4 mg is for use in opioid-tolerant patients only. Ingestion of these capsules or of the pellets within the capsules may cause fatal respiratory depression when administered to patients not already tolerant to high doses of opioids. 5.1 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of OpioidsEMBEDA contains morphine, an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule II controlled substance. Opioid agonists have the potential for being abused and are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Morphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing EMBEDA in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Abuse of EMBEDA by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9)]. Concerns about abuse and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse of this product. 5.2 Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of AbuseEMBEDA may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result. Patients should not consume alcoholic beverages, prescription or non-prescription medications containing alcohol while on EMBEDA therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with EMBEDA can result in an increase of morphine plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of morphine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 5.3 Impaired RespirationRespiratory depression is the chief hazard of all morphine preparations such as EMBEDA. Respiratory depression occurs more frequently and is more dangerous in elderly and debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or upper airway obstruction (when even moderate therapeutic doses may significantly decrease pulmonary ventilation). EMBEDA should be used with extreme caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve (e.g., severe kyphoscoliosis), hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of morphine may increase airway resistance and decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients, alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. 5.4 Head Injury and Increased Intracranial PressureThe respiratory depressant effects of morphine with carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. EMBEDA can produce effects on pupillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in pressure in patients with head injuries. EMBEDA should only be administered under such circumstances when considered essential and then with extreme care. 5.5 Hypotensive EffectEMBEDA may cause severe hypotension. There is an added risk to individuals whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or a concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines or general anesthetics [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)]. EMBEDA may produce orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. EMBEDA should be administered with caution to patients in circulatory shock, as vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Interactions with other CNS DepressantsEMBEDA should be used with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma may result [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) ]. 5.7 Gastrointestinal EffectsEMBEDA should not be given to patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, particularly paralytic ileus, as there is a risk of the product remaining in the stomach for an extended period and the subsequent release of a bolus of morphine when normal gut motility is restored. As with other solid morphine formulations diarrhea may reduce morphine absorption. The administration of morphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal condition. 5.8 CordotomyPatients taking EMBEDA who are scheduled for cordotomy or other interruption of pain transmission pathways should have EMBEDA ceased 24 hours prior to the procedure and the pain controlled by parenteral short-acting opioids. In addition, the post-procedure titration of analgesics for such patients should be individualized to avoid either oversedation or withdrawal syndromes. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract DiseaseEMBEDA may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase level. 5.10 Tolerance and Physical DependenceTolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Physical dependence is manifested by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation of a drug or upon administration of an antagonist. Physical dependence and tolerance are common during chronic opioid therapy. The opioid abstinence or withdrawal syndrome is characterized by some or all of the following: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other symptoms also may develop, including: irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. EMBEDA should not be abruptly discontinued [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5)]. 5.11 Special Risk GroupsEMBEDA should be administered with caution, and in reduced dosages in elderly or debilitated patients; patients with severe renal or hepatic insufficiency; patients with Addison's disease; myxedema; hypothyroidism; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture. Caution should also be exercised in the administration of EMBEDA to patients with CNS depression, toxic psychosis, acute alcoholism, and delirium tremens. All opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.12 Driving and Operating MachineryEMBEDA may impair the mental and/or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Patients must be cautioned accordingly. Patients should also be warned about the potential combined effects of EMBEDA with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, phenothiazines, sedative/hypnotics, and alcohol [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)]. 5.13 AnaphylaxisAlthough extremely rare, cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with the use of a similar extended release morphine formulation. 5.14 Accidentally Precipitated WithdrawalAgonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with EMBEDA. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of EMBEDA and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. Consuming EMBEDA that have been tampered by crushing, chewing, or dissolving the extended-release formulation can release sufficient naltrexone to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals. Symptoms of withdrawal usually appear within five minutes of ingestion of naltrexone and can last for up to 48 hours. Mental status changes can include confusion, somnolence, and visual hallucinations. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea can require intravenous fluid administration. Patients should be closely monitored and therapy with non-opioid medications tailored to meet individual requirements. 5.15 Laboratory TestsNaltrexone does not interfere with thin-layer, gas-liquid, and high pressure liquid chromatographic methods which may be used for the separation and detection of morphine, methadone, or quinine in the urine. Naltrexone may or may not interfere with enzymatic methods for the detection of opioids depending on the specificity of the test. Please consult the test manufacturer for specific details."

Respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma may result. The analgesic effect of morphine is potentiated by chlorpromazine and methocarbamol. Morphine may increase the anticoagulant activity of coumarin and other anticoagulants. Concurrent administration of cimetidine and morphine has been reported to precipitate apnea, confusion and muscle twitching in an isolated report. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors markedly potentiate the action of morphine. Neostigmine increases the intensity and duration of the analgesic action of morphine. When morphine is to be administered to patients receiving propiomazine (Largon), the dose of morphine should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Reserpine inhibits the analgesic action of morphine. Veratrum alkaloids may have additive effects, particularly on respiratory depression, when administered concurrently withmorphine.

Cardiovascular: Flushing of the face, peripheral circulatory collapse, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, hypotension, syncope, and phlebitis following I.V. injection. Genito-urinary: Ureteral spasm and spasm of vesical sphincters, urinary retention or hesitancy, oliguria, antidiuretic effect, reduced libido and/or potency. Allergic: Pruritus, urticaria, other skin rashes, edema, and (rarely) hemorrhagic urticaria. Wheal and flare over the vein with I.V. injection may occur. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported following I.V. administration. An isolated case of thrombocytopenia has been reported to be induced by morphine."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse experience encountered during administration of DURAMORPH is respiratory depression and/or respiratory arrest. This depression and/or respiratory arrest may be severe and could require intervention. (See WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE .) Because of delay in maximum CNS effect with intravenously administered drug (30 min), rapid administration may result in overdosing. Single-dose neuraxial administration may result in acute or delayed respiratory depression for periods at least as long as 24 hours. Tolerance and myoclonus: See WARNINGS for discussion of these and related hazards. While low doses of intravenously administered morphine have little effect on cardiovascular stability, high doses are excitatory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and increase in circulating catecholamines. Excitation of the central nervous system, resulting in convulsions, may accompany high doses of morphine given intravenously. Dysphoric reactions may occur after any size dose and toxic psychoses have been reported. Pruritus: Single-dose epidural or intrathecal administration is accompanied by a high incidence of pruritus that is dose-related but not confined to the site of administration. Pruritus, following continuous infusion of epidural or intrathecal morphine, is occasionally reported in the literature; these reactions are poorly understood as to their cause. Urinary retention: Urinary retention, which may persist 10 to 20 hours following single epidural or intrathecal administration, is a frequent side effect and must be anticipated primarily in male patients, with a somewhat lower incidence in females. Also frequently reported in the literature is the occurrence of urinary retention during the first several days of hospitalization for the initiation of continuous intrathecal or epidural morphine therapy. Patients who develop urinary retention have responded to cholinomimetic treatment and/or judicious use of catheters (see PRECAUTIONS ). Constipation: Constipation is frequently encountered during continuous infusion of morphine; this can usually be managed by conventional therapy. Headache: Lumbar puncture-type headache is encountered in a significant minority of cases for several days following intrathecal catheter implantation; this, generally, responds to bed rest and/or other conventional therapy. Other: Other adverse experiences reported following morphine therapy include—Dizziness, euphoria, anxiety, hypotension, confusion, reduced male potency, decreased libido in men and women, and menstrual irregularities including amenorrhea, depression of cough reflex, interference with thermal regulation and oliguria. Evidence of histamine release such as urticaria, wheals and/or local tissue irritation may occur. Nausea and vomiting are frequently seen in patients following morphine administration. Pruritus, nausea/vomiting and urinary retention, if associated with continuous infusion therapy, may respond to intravenous administration of a low dose of naloxone (0.2 mg). The risks of using narcotic antagonists in patients chronically receiving narcotic therapy should be considered. In general, side effects are amenable to reversal by narcotic antagonists. NALOXONE INJECTION AND RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR ADMINISTRATION IN CASE OF LIFE-THREATENING OR INTOLERABLE SIDE EFFECTS AND WHENEVER DURAMORPH THERAPY IS BEING INITIATED."
