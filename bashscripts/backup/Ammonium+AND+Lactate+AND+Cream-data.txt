Other adverse reactions which occur less frequently are irritation, eczema, petechiae, dryness and hyperpigmentation. Due to more severe initial skin conditions associated with ichthyosis, there was a higher incidence of transient stinging, burning and erythema (each occurring in 1 in 10 patients)."
