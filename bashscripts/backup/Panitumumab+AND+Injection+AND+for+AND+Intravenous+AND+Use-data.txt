        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Dermatologic and Soft Tissue Toxicity [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Increased Tumor Progression, Increased Mortality, or Lack of Benefit in RAS- and KRAS -Mutant mCRC [see Indications and Usage ( 1.1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Electrolyte Depletion/Monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Infusion Reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Acute Renal Failure in Combination with Chemotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Pulmonary Fibrosis/Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Ocular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Increased Mortality and Toxicity with Vectibix in combination with Bevacizumab and Chemotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (>= 20%) of Vectibix as monotherapy are skin rash with variable presentations, paronychia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. (6.1) Most common adverse reactions (>= 20%) in clinical trials of Vectibix in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy are diarrhea, stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, paronychia, anorexia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, rash, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, and dry skin. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Inc. at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical studies does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Safety data are presented from two clinical trials in which patients received Vectibix: Study 1, an open-label, multinational, randomized, controlled, monotherapy clinical trial (N = 463) evaluating Vectibix with best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone in patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC and Study 3, a randomized, controlled trial (N = 1183) in patients with mCRC that evaluated Vectibix in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy versus FOLFOX chemotherapy alone. Safety data for Study 3 are limited to 656 patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC. Vectibix Monotherapy In Study 1, the most common adverse reactions (>= 20%) with Vectibix were skin rash with variable presentations, paronychia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. The most common (> 5%) serious adverse reactions in the Vectibix arm were general physical health deterioration and intestinal obstruction. The most frequently reported adverse reactions for Vectibix leading to withdrawal were general physical health deterioration (n = 2) and intestinal obstruction (n = 2). For Study 1, the data described in Table 1 and in other sections below, except where noted, reflect exposure to Vectibix administered to patients with mCRC as a single agent at the recommended dose and schedule (6 mg/kg every 2 weeks).

In Study 1, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients receiving Vectibix. Skin toxicity was severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients. Ocular toxicities occurred in 16% of patients and included, but were not limited to, conjunctivitis (5%). One patient experienced an NCI-CTC grade 3 event of mucosal inflammation. The incidence of paronychia was 25% and was severe in 2% of patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. In Study 1 (N = 229), median time to the development of dermatologic, nail, or ocular toxicity was 12 days after the first dose of Vectibix; the median time to most severe skin/ocular toxicity was 15 days after the first dose of Vectibix; and the median time to resolution after the last dose of Vectibix was 98 days. Severe toxicity necessitated dose interruption in 11% of Vectibix-treated patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Subsequent to the development of severe dermatologic toxicities, infectious complications, including sepsis, septic death, necrotizing fasciitis, and abscesses requiring incisions and drainage were reported. Vectibix in Combi nation w ith FOLFOX Chemotherapy The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>= 20%) in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC receiving Vectibix (6 mg/kg every 2 weeks) and FOLFOX therapy (N = 322) in Study 3 were diarrhea, stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, paronychia, anorexia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, rash, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, and dry skin (Table 2). Serious adverse reactions (>= 2% difference between treatment arms) in Vectibix-treated patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC were diarrhea and dehydration. The commonly reported adverse reactions (>= 1%) leading to discontinuation in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC receiving Vectibix were rash, paresthesia, fatigue, diarrhea, acneiform dermatitis, and hypersensitivity. One grade 5 adverse reaction, hypokalemia, occurred in a patient who received Vectibix.

Infusion Reactions Infusional toxicity manifesting as fever, chills, dyspnea, bronchospasm or hypotension was assessed within 24 hours of an infusion during the clinical study. Vital signs and temperature were measured within 30 minutes prior to initiation and upon completion of the Vectibix infusion. The use of premedication was not standardized in the clinical trials. Thus, the utility of premedication in preventing the first or subsequent episodes of infusional toxicity is unknown. Across clinical trials of Vectibix monotherapy, 3% (24/725) experienced infusion reactions of which < 1% (3/725) were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3-4). In one patient, Vectibix was permanently discontinued for a serious infusion reaction [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) ]. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of Vectibix has been evaluated using two different screening immunoassays for the detection of binding anti-panitumumab antibodies: an acid dissociation bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detecting high-affinity antibodies and a Biacore(R) biosensor immunoassay detecting both high- and low-affinity antibodies. For patients whose sera tested positive in screening immunoassays, an in vitro biological assay was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies. Monotherapy: The incidence of binding anti-panitumumab antibodies (excluding preexisting and transient positive patients) was 0.4% (5/1123) as detected by the acid dissociation ELISA and 3.2% (36/1123) as detected by the Biacore(R) assay. The incidence of neutralizing anti-panitumumab antibodies (excluding preexisting and transient positive patients) was 0.8% (9/1123). There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic or safety profiles in patients who developed antibodies to Vectibix. In combination with chemotherapy: The incidence of binding anti-panitumumab antibodies (excluding preexisting positive patients) was 0.9% (12/1297) as detected by the acid dissociation ELISA and 0.7% (9/1296) as detected by the Biacore(R) assay. The incidence of neutralizing anti-panitumumab antibodies (excluding preexisting positive patients) was 0.2% (2/1297). No evidence of an altered safety profile was found in patients who developed antibodies to Vectibix. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to panitumumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Vectibix. Because these reactions are reported in a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Skin necrosis, angioedema, life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Immune system disorders: Infusion reaction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Eye disorders: Keratitis/ulcerative keratitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dermatologic and Soft Tissue Toxicity: Monitor for dermatologic and soft tissue toxicities and withhold or discontinue Vectibix for severe or life-threatening complications. Limit sun exposure. (5.1, 5.7) Increased tumor progression, increased mortality, or lack of benefit in patients with RA S-mutant mCRC. (2.1, 5.2) Electrolyte Depletion/Monitoring: Monitor electrolytes and institute appropriate treatment. (5.3) Infusion Reactions: Terminate the infusion for severe infusion reactions. (5.4) Pulmonary Fibrosis/Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): Permanently discontinue Vectibix in patients developing ILD. (5.6) Ocular Toxicities: Monitor for keratitis or ulcerative keratitis. Interrupt or discontinue Vectibix for acute or worsening keratitis. (5.8) 5.1 Dermatologic and Soft Tissue Toxicit y In Study 1, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients with mCRC receiving Vectibix. The clinical manifestations included, but were not limited to, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, erythema, rash, skin exfoliation, paronychia, dry skin, and skin fissures. Monitor patients who develop dermatologic or soft tissue toxicities while receiving Vectibix for the development of inflammatory or infectious sequelae. Life-threatening and fatal infectious complications including necrotizing fasciitis, abscesses, and sepsis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix. Life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing has also been observed in patients treated with Vectibix. It could not be determined whether these mucocutaneous adverse reactions were directly related to EGFR inhibition or to idiosyncratic immune-related effects (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis). Withhold or discontinue Vectibix for dermatologic or soft tissue toxicity associated with severe or life-threatening inflammatory or infectious complications [see Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Dose modifications for Vectibix concerning dermatologic toxicity are provided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. 5.2 Increased Tumor Progression, Increased Mortality , or Lack of Benefit in P atients with RAS - Mutant mCRC Vectibix is not indicated for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer that harbor somatic mutations in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) of either KRAS or NRAS and hereafter is referred to as "RAS" [see Indications and Usage ( 1.1 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Retrospective subset analyses across several randomized clinical trials were conducted to investigate the role of RAS mutations on the clinical effects of anti-EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies (panitumumab or cetuximab). Anti-EGFR antibodies in patients with tumors containing RAS mutations resulted in exposing those patients to anti-EGFR related adverse reactions without clinical benefit from these agents [see Indications and Usage ( 1.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Additionally, in Study 3, 272 patients with RAS-mutant mCRC tumors received Vectibix in combination with FOLFOX and 276 patients received FOLFOX alone. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, OS was shorter (HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.45) in patients with RAS-mutant mCRC who received Vectibix and FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone [see Indications and Usage ( 1.1 )]. 5. 3 Electrolyte Depletion/Monitoring Progressively decreasing serum magnesium levels leading to severe (grade 3-4) hypomagnesemia occurred in up to 7% (in Study 2) of patients across clinical trials. Monitor patients for hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating Vectibix treatment, periodically during Vectibix treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after the completion of treatment. Other electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, have also been observed. Replete magnesium and other electrolytes as appropriate. 5. 4 Infusion Reactions In Study 1, 4% of patients experienced infusion reactions and 1% of patients experienced severe infusion reactions (NCI-CTC grade 3-4). Infusion reactions, manifesting as fever, chills, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypotension, can occur following Vectibix administration [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.3 )]. Fatal infusion reactions occurred in postmarketing experience. Terminate the infusion for severe infusion reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. 5. 5 Acute Renal Failure in Combination with Chemotherapy Severe diarrhea and dehydration, leading to acute renal failure and other complications, have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix in combination with chemotherapy. 5 . 6 Pulmonary Fibrosis /Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Fatal and nonfatal cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (1%) and pulmonary fibrosis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix. Pulmonary fibrosis occurred in less than 1% (2/1467) of patients enrolled in clinical studies of Vectibix. In the event of acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms, interrupt Vectibix therapy. Discontinue Vectibix therapy if ILD is confirmed. In patients with a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, the benefits of therapy with Vectibix versus the risk of pulmonary complications must be carefully considered. 5. 7 Photosensitivity Exposure to sunlight can exacerbate dermatologic toxicity. Advise patients to wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun exposure while receiving Vectibix. 5. 8 Ocular Toxicities Keratitis and ulcerative keratitis, known risk factors for corneal perforation, have been reported with Vectibix use. Monitor for evidence of keratitis or ulcerative keratitis. Interrupt or discontinue Vectibix therapy for acute or worsening keratitis. 5. 9 Increased Mortality and Toxicity with Vectibix in Combination with Bevacizumab and Chemotherapy In an interim analysis of an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial in the first-line setting in patients with mCRC, the addition of Vectibix to the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy resulted in decreased OS and increased incidence of NCI-CTC grade 3-5 (87% vs 72%) adverse reactions. NCI-CTC grade 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher rate in Vectibix-treated patients included rash/acneiform dermatitis (26% vs 1%), diarrhea (23% vs 12%), dehydration (16% vs 5%), primarily occurring in patients with diarrhea, hypokalemia (10% vs 4%), stomatitis/mucositis (4% vs < 1%), and hypomagnesemia (4% vs 0). NCI-CTC grade 3-5 pulmonary embolism occurred at a higher rate in Vectibix-treated patients (7% vs 3%) and included fatal events in three (< 1%) Vectibix-treated patients. As a result of the toxicities experienced, patients randomized to Vectibix, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy received a lower mean relative dose intensity of each chemotherapeutic agent (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bolus 5-FU, and/or infusional 5-FU) over the first 24 weeks on study compared with those randomized to bevacizumab and chemotherapy."
