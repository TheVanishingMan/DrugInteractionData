        "Drug Interactions Insulin requirements in diabetes mellitus may be altered in association with the use of methamphetamine and the concomitant dietary regimen. Methamphetamine may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine. Methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets should not be used concurrently with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Concurrent administration of tricyclic antidepressants and indirect-acting sympathomimetic amines such as the amphetamines, should be closely supervised and dosage carefully adjusted.
