        "Drug Interactions Didanosine: At an oral dose of 1000 mg of ganciclovir every 8 hours and didanosine, 200 mg every 12 hours, the steady-state didanosine AUC0-12 increased 111 ± 114% (range: 10% to 493%) when didanosine was administered either 2 hours prior to or concurrent with administration of ganciclovir (n = 12 patients, 23 observations). A decrease in steady-state ganciclovir AUC of 21 ± 17% (range: -44% to 5%) was observed when didanosine was administered 2 hours prior to administration of ganciclovir, but ganciclovir AUC was not affected by the presence of didanosine when the two drugs were administered simultaneously (n = 12). There were no significant changes in renal clearance for either drug. Zidovudine: At an oral dose of 1000 mg of ganciclovir every 8 hours, mean steady-state ganciclovir AUC0-8 decreased 17 ± 25% (range: -52% to 23%) in the presence of zidovudine, 100 mg every 4 hours (n = 12). Steady-state zidovudine AUC0-4 increased 19 ± 27% (range: -11% to 74%) in the presence of ganciclovir. Since both zidovudine and ganciclovir have the potential to cause neutropenia and anemia, some patients may not tolerate concomitant therapy with these drugs at full dosage. Probenecid: At an oral dose of 1000 mg of ganciclovir every 8 hours (n = 10), ganciclovir AUC0-8 increased 53 ± 91% (range: -14% to 299%) in the presence of probenecid, 500 mg every 6 hours. Renal clearance of ganciclovir decreased 22 ± 20% (range: -54% to -4%), which is consistent with an interaction involving competition for renal tubular secretion. Imipenem-cilastatin: Generalized seizures have been reported in patients who received ganciclovir and imipenem-cilastatin. These drugs should not be used concomitantly unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Other Medications: It is possible that drugs that inhibit replication of rapidly dividing cell populations such as bone marrow, spermatogonia and germinal layers of skin and gastrointestinal mucosa may have additive toxicity when administered concomitantly with ganciclovir. Therefore, drugs such as dapsone, pentamidine, flucytosine, vincristine, vinblastine, adriamycin, amphotericin B, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combinations or other nucleoside analogues, should be considered for concomitant use with ganciclovir only if the potential benefits are judged to outweigh the risks. No formal drug interaction studies of ganciclovir and drugs commonly used in transplant recipients have been conducted."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse events that occurred during clinical trials of ganciclovir capsules are summarized below, according to the participating study subject population. Subjects With AIDS Three controlled, randomized, phase 3 trials comparing ganciclovir-IV and ganciclovir capsules for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis have been completed. During these trials, ganciclovir-IV or ganciclovir capsules were prematurely discontinued in 9% of subjects because of adverse events. In a placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 3 trial of ganciclovir capsules for prevention of CMV disease in AIDS, treatment was prematurely discontinued because of adverse events, new or worsening intercurrent illness, or laboratory abnormalities in 19.5% of subjects treated with ganciclovir capsules and 16% of subjects receiving placebo. Laboratory data and adverse events reported during the conduct of these controlled trials are summarized below. Laboratory Data: Selected Laboratory Abnormalities in Trials for Treatment of CMV Retinitis and Prevention of CMV Disease * Pooled data from Treatment Studies, ICM 1653, Study ICM 1774 and Study AVI 034. # Mean time on therapy = 91days, including allowed reinduction treatment periods ## Mean time on therapy = 103 days, including allowed reinduction treatment periods $ Data from Prevention Study, ICM 1654 || Mean time on ganciclovir = 269 days & Mean time on placebo = 240 days (See discussion of clinical trials under INDICATIONS AND USAGE.)

Selected Adverse Events Reported in >= 5% of Subjects in Three Randomized Phase 3 Studies Comparing Ganciclovir Capsules to Ganciclovir-IV Solution for Maintenance Treatment of CMV Retinitis and in One Phase 3 Randomized Study Comparing Ganciclovir Capsules to Placebo for Prevention of CMV Disease *Some of these events also appear under other body systems.

Retinal Detachment: Retinal detachment has been observed in subjects with CMV retinitis both before and after initiation of therapy with ganciclovir. Its relationship to therapy with ganciclovir is unknown. Retinal detachment occurred in 8% of patients treated with ganciclovir capsules. Patients with CMV retinitis should have frequent ophthalmologic evaluations to monitor the status of their retinitis and to detect any other retinal pathology. Transplant Recipients There has been one controlled clinical trial of ganciclovir capsules for the prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Laboratory data and adverse events reported during these trials are summarized below. Laboratory Data: The following table shows the frequency of granulocytopenia (neutropenia) and thrombocytopenia observed: ## Study GAN040. Mean duration of ganciclovir treatment = 82 days (See discussion of clinical trails under INDICATIONS AND USAGE.)

Most patients in these studies also received cyclosporine. The mechanism of impairment of renal function is not known. However, careful monitoring of renal function during therapy with ganciclovir capsules is essential, especially for those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity. General Other adverse events that were thought to be "probably" or "possibly" related to ganciclovir capsules in controlled clinical studies in either subjects with AIDS or transplant recipients are listed below. These events all occurred in at least 3 subjects. Body as a Whole: abdomen enlarged, asthenia, chest pain, edema, headache, injection site inflammation, malaise, pain Digestive System: abnormal liver function test, aphthous stomatitis, constipation, dyspepsia, eructation Hemic and Lymphatic System: pancytopenia Respiratory System: cough increased, dyspnea Nervous System: abnormal dreams, anxiety, confusion, depression, dizziness, dry mouth, insomnia, seizures, somnolence, thinking abnormal, tremor Skin and Appendages: alopecia, dry skin Special Senses: abnormal vision, taste perversion, tinnitus, vitreous disorder Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: creatinine increased, SGOT increased, SGPT increased, weight loss Cardiovascular System: hypertension, phlebitis, vasodilatation Urogenital System: creatinine clearance decreased, kidney failure, kidney function abnormal, urinary frequency Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia, leg cramps, myalgia, myasthenia The following adverse events reported in patients receiving ganciclovir may be potentially fatal: gastrointestinal perforation, multiple organ failure, pancreatitis and sepsis. Adverse Events Reported During Postmarketing Experience With Ganciclovir Capsules The following events have been identified during postapproval use of the drug. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either the seriousness, frequency of reporting, the apparent causal connection or a combination of these factors: acidosis, allergic reaction, anaphylactic reaction, arthritis, bronchospasm, cardiac arrest, cardiac conduction abnormality, cataracts, cholelithiasis, cholestasis, congenital anomaly, dry eyes, dysesthesia, dysphasia, elevated triglyceride levels, encephalopathy, exfoliative dermatitis, extrapyramidal reaction, facial palsy, hallucinations, hemolytic anemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, hepatic failure, hepatitis, hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, inappropriate serum ADH, infertility, intestinal ulceration, intracranial hypertension, irritability, loss of memory, loss of sense of smell, myelopathy, oculomotor nerve paralysis, peripheral ischemia, pulmonary fibrosis, renal tubular disorder, rhabdomyolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, stroke, testicular hypotrophy, Torsades de Pointes, vasculitis, ventricular tachycardia"
