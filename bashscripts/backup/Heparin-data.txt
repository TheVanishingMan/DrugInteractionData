        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding. (7.2) 7.1 Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained. 7.2 Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. 7.3 Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, or antihistamines, or intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Prothrombin time - Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with warfarin, allow a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose of heparin to elapse before blood is drawn to obtain a valid prothrombin time."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: -Fatal Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] -Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] -Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] -Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] -Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] -Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT (With or Without Thrombosis), injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of heparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. - Hemorrhage - Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: -Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. -Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. - Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) and Thrombocytopenia: [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 and 5.4)] - Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. - Elevations of serum aminotransferases - Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. - Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high-doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration. (5.1) -Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage. (5.2) -HIT (With or Without Thrombosis): Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT (With or Without Thrombosis). (5.3) -Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin. (5.5) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use this product as a "catheter lock flush" product. Heparin is supplied in various strengths. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred due to medication errors. Carefully examine all heparin products to confirm the correct container choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving HEPARIN SODIUM. Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: - Cardiovascular — Subacute bacterial endocarditis. Severe hypertension. - Surgical — During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord or eye. - Hematologic — Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. - Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). - Gastrointestinal — Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. - Other — Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) HIT is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as HIT with thrombosis. Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HIT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombus formation on a prosthetic cardiac valve, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.5 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, heparin sodium should be discontinued promptly [see Overdosage (10) ]. Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.6 Heparin Resistance Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer and in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Because heparin sodium is derived from animal tissue, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity when it is used in patients with a history of allergy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hemorrhage Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy (see WARNINGS ). An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug (see OVERDOSAGE ). It should be appreciated that gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: (a) Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, such treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of acute adrenal hemorrhage and insufficiency. Initiation of corrective therapy should not depend on laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, since any delay in an acute situation may result in the patient's death. (b) Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term anticoagulant therapy. This complication, if unrecognized, may be fatal. (c) Retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia, Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (HITT) and Delayed Onset of HIT and HITT See WARNINGS . Local Irritation Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. These complications are much more common after intramuscular use, and such use is not recommended. Hypersensitivity Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring more rarely. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Certain episodes of painful, ischemic and cyanosed limbs have in the past been attributed to allergic vasospastic reactions. Whether these are in fact identical to the thrombocytopenia-associated complications, remains to be determined. Miscellaneous Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding. (7.1) 7.1 Drugs Enhancing Heparin Effect -Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation - These drugs (e.g., systemic salicylates, NSAIDs including celecoxib and ibuprofen, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, dextran) may induce bleeding. Use heparin sodium with caution in patients receiving such agents. -Antithrombin III (human) - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human). 7.2 Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, nitrates, and antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Monitor patients' coagulation tests appropriately. 7.3 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions -Elevated aminotransferase levels - Significant elevations of AST and ALT levels without elevation in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase have occurred in patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin. Because aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnoses of certain conditions including myocardial infarction, liver disease, and pulmonary emboli, elevations in aminotransferase levels that may be related to heparin use should be interpreted with caution. -Prothrombin time - Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with warfarin, allow a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose of heparin to elapse before blood is drawn to obtain a valid prothrombin time."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. - Hemorrhage - Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: - HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. - Local irritation - Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma, or ulceration have occurred following deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because such reactions occur more frequently after intramuscular administration, the IM route is not recommended. -Histamine-like reactions - Such reactions have been observed at the site of injection. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. - Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations; asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occur less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar site of the feet, may occur. - Elevations of serum aminotransferases - Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. - Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration. (5.1) -Hemorrhage: Fatal cases have occurred. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage. (5.2) -HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS. (5.3) -Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants. (5.4) - Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Monitor platelet count and hematocrit in all patients receiving heparin. (5.5, 5.6) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION as a \"catheter lock flush\" product. HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION vials were confused with 1 mL \"catheter lock flush\" vials. Carefully examine all HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1]). A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or fall in blood pressure should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: - Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension - Surgical - During and immediately following: (a) spinal puncture or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye - Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, and some vascular purpuras - Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). - Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions, continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine, and clinical settings in which stress-induced gastrointestinal hemorrhage is possible. - Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis, severe renal disease, or in patients with indwelling catheters. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT and HITT. 5.4 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Use preservative-free HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION in neonates and infants. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin regimen, adjust the heparin dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin promptly [see Overdosage (10)]. Periodic platelet counts and hematocrits are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hemorrhage Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy (see WARNINGS ). An overly prolonged clotting time or minor bleeding during therapy can usually be controlled by withdrawing the drug (see OVERDOSAGE ). It should be appreciated that gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect: (a) Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred during anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, such treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of acute adrenal hemorrhage and insufficiency. Initiation of corrective therapy should not depend on laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, since any delay in an acute situation may result in the patient's death.
