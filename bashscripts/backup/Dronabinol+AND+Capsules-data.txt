        "Drug Interactions In studies involving patients with AIDS and/or cancer, Dronabinol Capsules has been co-administered with a variety of medications (e.g., cytotoxic agents, anti-infective agents, sedatives, or opioid analgesics) without resulting in any clinically significant drug/drug interactions. Although no drug/drug interactions were discovered during the clinical trials of Dronabinol Capsules, cannabinoids may interact with other medications through both metabolic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Dronabinol is highly protein bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, might displace other protein-bound drugs. Although this displacement has not been confirmed in vivo, practitioners should monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering dronabinol to patients receiving other highly protein-bound drugs. Published reports of drug/drug interactions involving cannabinoids are summarized in the following table. CONCOMITANT DRUG CLINICAL EFFECT(S) Amphetamines, cocaine, other sympathomimetic agents Additive hypertension, tachycardia, possibly cardiotoxicity Atropine, scopolamine, antihistamines, other anticholinergic agents Additive or super-additive tachycardia, drowsiness Amitriptyline, amoxapine, desipramine, other tricyclic antidepressants Additive tachycardia, hypertension, drowsiness Barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ethanol, lithium, opioids, buspirone, antihistamines, muscle relaxants, other CNS depressants Additive drowsiness and CNS depression Disulfiram A reversible hypomanic reaction was reported in a 28 y/o man who smoked marijuana; confirmed by dechallenge and rechallenge Fluoxetine A 21 y/o female with depression and bulimia receiving 20 mg/day fluoxetine Ã— 4 wks became hypomanic after smoking marijuana; symptoms resolved after 4 days Antipyrine, barbiturates Decreased clearance of these agents, presumably via competitive inhibition of metabolism Theophylline Increased theophylline metabolism reported with smoking of marijuana; effect similar to that following smoking tobacco"

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse experiences information summarized in the tables below was derived from well-controlled clinical trials conducted in the U.S. and U.S. territories involving 474 patients exposed to Dronabinol Capsules. Studies of AIDS-related weight loss included 157 patients receiving dronabinol at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and 67 receiving placebo. Studies of different durations were combined by considering the first occurrence of events during the first 28 days. Studies of nausea and vomiting related to cancer chemotherapy included 317 patients receiving dronabinol and 68 receiving placebo. A cannabinoid dose-related \"high\" (easy laughing, elation and heightened awareness) has been reported by patients receiving Dronabinol Capsules in the antiemetic (24%) and the lower dose appetite stimulant clinical trials (8%). (See Clinical Trials .) The most frequently reported adverse experiences in patients with AIDS during placebo-controlled clinical trials involved the CNS and were reported by 33% of patients receiving Dronabinol Capsules. About 25% of patients reported a minor CNS adverse event during the first 2 weeks and about 4% reported such an event each week for the next 6 weeks thereafter. PROBABLY CAUSALLY RELATED Incidence greater than 1% Rates derived from clinical trials in AIDS-related anorexia (N=157) and chemotherapy-related nausea (N=317).

Body as a whole: Chills, headache, malaise. Digestive: Anorexia, hepatic enzyme elevation. Respiratory: Cough, rhinitis, sinusitis. Skin and Appendages: Sweating. Postmarketing Experience Seizure and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving Dronabinol Capsules during marketed use of the drug and in clinical trials.

Rates were generally higher in the anti-emetic use (given in parentheses). *Incidence of events 3% to 10% Body as a whole: Asthenia. Cardiovascular: Palpitations, tachycardia, vasodilation/facial flush. Digestive: Abdominal pain*, nausea*, vomiting*. Nervous system: (Amnesia), anxiety/nervousness, (ataxia), confusion, depersonalization, dizziness*, euphoria*, (hallucination), paranoid reaction*, somnolence*, thinking abnormal*. PROBABLY CAUSALLY RELATED: Incidence less than 1%. Event rates derived from clinical trials in AIDS-related anorexia (N=157) and chemotherapy-related nausea (N=317). *Incidence of events 0.3% to 1% Cardiovascular: Conjunctivitis*, hypotension*. Digestive: Diarrhea*, fecal incontinence. Musculoskeletal: Myalgias. Nervous system: Depression, nightmares, speech difficulties, tinnitus. Skin and Appendages: Flushing*. Special senses: Vision difficulties. CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP UNKNOWN: Incidence less than 1%. The clinical significance of the association of these events with dronabinol capsules treatment is unknown, but they are reported as alerting information for the clinician. Body as a whole: Chills, headache, malaise. Digestive: Anorexia, hepatic enzyme elevation. Respiratory: Cough, rhinitis, sinusitis. Skin and Appendages: Sweating Postmarketing Experience Seizure and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving dronabinol capsules during marketed use of the drug and in clinical trials. (see PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE .) Reports of fatigue have also been received. A causal relationship between dronabinol capsules and these events has not been established."
