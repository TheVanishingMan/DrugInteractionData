        "Drug Interactions ACE-inhibitors Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors. Aspirin As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of tolmetin sodium and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects. Diuretics Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. Lithium NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate. Warfarin The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone. The in vitro binding of warfarin to human plasma proteins is unaffected by tolmetin, and tolmetin does not alter the prothrombin time of normal volunteers. However, increased prothrombin time and bleeding have been reported in patients on concomitant tolmetin sodium and warfarin therapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering tolmetin sodium capsules to patients on anticoagulants. Hypoglycemic Agents In adult diabetic patients under treatment with either sulfonylureas or insulin there is no change in the clinical effects of either tolmetin sodium capsules or the hypoglycemic agents."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse reactions which have been observed in clinical trials encompass observations in about 4370 patients treated with tolmetin sodium, over 800 of whom have undergone at least one year of therapy. These adverse reactions, reported below by body system, are among those typical of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and, as expected, gastrointestinal complaints were most frequent. In clinical trials with tolmetin sodium, about 10% of patients dropped out because of adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal in nature. Incidence Greater Than 1% The following adverse reactions which occurred more frequently than 1 in 100 were reported in controlled clinical trials. Gastrointestinal: Nausea (11%), dyspepsia,* gastrointestinal distress,* abdominal pain,* diarrhea,* flatulence,* vomiting,* constipation, gastritis, and peptic ulcer. Forty percent of the ulcer patients had a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or were receiving concomitant anti-inflammatory drugs including corticosteroids, which are known to produce peptic ulceration. Body as a Whole: Headache,* asthenia,* chest pain Cardiovascular: Elevated blood pressure,* edema* Central Nervous System: Dizziness,* drowsiness, depression Metabolic/Nutritional: Weight gain,* weight loss* Dermatologic: Skin irritation Special Senses: Tinnitus, visual disturbance Hematologic: Small and transient decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit not associated with gastrointestinal bleeding have occurred. These are similar to changes reported with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Urogenital: Elevated BUN, urinary tract infection * Reactions occurring in 3% to 9% of patients treated with tolmetin sodium. Reactions occurring in fewer than 3% of the patients are unmarked. Incidence Less Than 1% - (Causal Relationship Probable) The following adverse reactions were reported less frequently than 1 in 100 controlled clinical trials or were reported since marketing. The probability exists that there is a causal relationship between tolmetin sodium and these adverse reactions. Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal bleeding with or without evidence of peptic ulcer, perforation, glossitis, stomatitis, hepatitis, liver function abnormalities Body as a Whole: Anaphylactoid reactions, fever, lymphadenopathy, serum sickness Hematologic: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis Cardiovascular: Congestive heart failure in patients with marginal cardiac function Dermatologic: Urticaria, purpura, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis Urogenital: Hematuria, proteinuria, dysuria, renal failure Incidence Less Than 1% - (Causal Relationship Unknown) Other adverse reactions were reported less frequently than 1 in 100 in controlled clinical trials or were reported since marketing, but a causal relationship between tolmetin sodium and the reaction could not be determined. These rarely reported reactions are being listed as alerting information for the physician since the possibility of a causal relationship cannot be excluded.
