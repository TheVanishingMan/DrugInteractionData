The data described below reflect exposure to Vancomycin HCl Capsules in 260 adult subjects in two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of diarrhea associated with C. difficile. In both trials, subjects received Vancomycin HCl Capsules 125 mg orally four times daily. The mean duration of treatment was 9.4 days. The median age of patients was 67, ranging between 19 and 96 years of age. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (93%) and 52% were male. Adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of Vancomycin HCl Capsules-treated subjects are shown in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions associated with Vancomycin HCl Capsules (>= 10%) were nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia. Table 1: Common (>= 5%) Adverse Reactionsa for Vancomycin HCl Capsules Reported in Clinical Trials for Treatment of Diarrhea Associated with C. difficile a Adverse reaction rates were derived from the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events.

Nephrotoxicity following Vancomycin HCl Capsules typically first occurred within one week after completion of treatment (median day of onset was Day 16). Nephrotoxicity following Vancomycin HCl Capsules occurred in 6% of subjects >65 years of age and 3% of subjects <=65 years of age (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Nephrotoxicity [5.3]). The incidences of hypokalemia, urinary tract infection, peripheral edema, insomnia, constipation, anemia, depression, vomiting, and hypotension were higher among subjects >65 years of age than in subjects <=65 years of age (see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS, Geriatric Use[8.5]). Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects treated with Vancomycin HCl Capsules. The most common adverse events leading, to discontinuation of Vancomycin HCl Capsules were C. difficile colitis (<1%), nausea (<1%), and vomiting (<1%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Vancomycin HCl Capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ototoxicity: Cases of hearing loss associated with intravenously administered vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a preexisting hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Ototoxicity [5.4]). Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported. Hematopoietic: Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of intravenous therapy with vancomycin or after a total dose of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has been reported. Miscellaneous: Patients have been reported to have had anaphylaxis, drug fever, chills, nausea, eosinophilia, rashes (including exfoliative dermatitis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and rare cases of vasculitis in association with the administration of vancomycin. A condition has been reported that is similar to the IV-induced syndrome with symptoms consistent with anaphylactoid reactions, including hypotension, wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the upper body (\"Red Man Syndrome\"), pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile -associated diarrhea. Orally administered Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules are not effective for other types of infections. (5.1) Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules for active C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Monitoring of serum concentrations may be appropriate in some instances. (5.2) Nephrotoxicity has occurred following oral Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules therapy and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk is increased in geriatric patients (5.3) Monitor renal function. Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules. (5.4) Assessment of auditory function may be appropriate in some instances. Prescribing Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. (5.6) 5.1 Oral Use Only This preparation for the treatment of colitis is for oral use only and is not systemically absorbed. Vancomycin HCl Capsules must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea. Orally administered Vancomycin HCl Capsules are not effective for other types of infections. Parenteral administration of vancomycin is not effective for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile -associated diarrhea. If parenteral vancomycin therapy is desired, use an intravenous preparation of vancomycin and consult the package insert accompanying that preparation. 5.2 Potential for Systemic Absorption Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of Vancomycin HCl Capsules for active C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Some patients with inflammatory disorders of the intestinal mucosa also may have significant systemic absorption of vancomycin. These patients may be at risk for the development of adverse reactions associated with higher doses of Vancomycin HCl Capsules; therefore, monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be appropriate in some instances, e.g., in patients with renal insufficiency and/or colitis or in those receiving concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside antibiotic. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) has occurred following oral Vancomycin HCl Capsules therapy in randomized controlled clinical studies, and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk of nephrotoxicity is increased in patients >65 years of age (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Clinical Trial Experience [6.1] and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS, Geriatric Use [8.5]). In patients >65 years of age, including those with normal renal function prior to treatment, renal function should be monitored during and following treatment with Vancomycin HCl Capsules to detect potential vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity. 5.4 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin. It may be transient or permanent. It has been reported mostly in patients who have been given excessive intravenous doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside. Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience [6.2]). 5.5 Superinfection Use of Vancomycin HCl Capsules may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Vancomycin HCl Capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria."

The risk of nephrotoxicity is increased in patients >65 years of age [see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Clinical Trial Experience (6.1) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS, Geriatric Use (8.5)]. In patients >65 years of age, including those with normal renal function prior to treatment, renal function should be monitored during and following treatment with Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules USP to detect potential vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity. 5.4 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin. It may be transient or permanent. It has been reported mostly in patients who have been given excessive intravenous doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside. Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity [see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience (6.2)]. 5.5 Superinfection Use of Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Infusion-Related Events During or soon after rapid infusion of vancomycin, patients may develop anaphylactoid reactions, including hypotension (see ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY ), wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, or pruritus. Rapid infusion may also cause flushing of the upper body (\"red neck\") or pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours. Such events are infrequent if vancomycin is given by a slow infusion over 60 minutes. In studies of normal volunteers, infusion-related events did not occur when vancomycin was administered at a rate of 10 mg/min or less. Nephrotoxicity Renal failure, principally manifested by increased serum creatinine or BUN concentrations, especially in patients administered large doses of vancomycin, has been reported rarely. Cases of interstitial nephritis have also been reported rarely. Most of these have occurred in patients who were given aminoglycosides concomitantly or who had preexisting kidney dysfunction. When vancomycin was discontinued, azotemia resolved in most patients. Ototoxicity A few dozen cases of hearing loss associated with vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a preexisting hearing loss, or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug. Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported rarely. Hematopoietic Reversible neutropenia, usually starting one week or more after onset of therapy with vancomycin or after a total dosage of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has rarely been reported. Although a causal relationship has not been established, reversible agranulocytosis (granulocytes <500/mm3) has been reported rarely. Phlebitis Inflammation at the injection site has been reported.

The data described below reflect exposure to vancomycin hydrochloride in 260 adult subjects in two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of diarrhea associated with C. difficile. In both trials, subjects received vancomycin hydrochloride 125 mg orally four times daily. The mean duration of treatment was 9.4 days. The median age of patients was 67, ranging between 19 and 96 years of age. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (93%) and 52% were male.

Nephrotoxicity following vancomycin hydrochloride typically first occurred within one week after completion of treatment (median day of onset was Day 16). Nephrotoxicity following vancomycin hydrochloride occurred in 6% of subjects >65 years of age and 3% of subjects <=65 years of age (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Nephrotoxicity [5.3]). The incidences of hypokalemia, urinary tract infection, peripheral edema, insomnia, constipation, anemia, depression, vomiting, and hypotension were higher among subjects >65 years of age than in subjects <=65 years of age (see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS, Geriatric Use [8.5]). Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects treated with vancomycin hydrochloride.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vancomycin must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Orally administered Vancomycin capsules are not effective for other types of infections. (5.1) Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of vancomycin for active C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Monitoring of serum concentrations may be appropriate in some instances. (5.2) Nephrotoxicity has occurred following oral vancomycin therapy and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk is increased in geriatric patients (5.3) Monitor renal function. Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin (5.4) Assessment of auditory function may be appropriate in some instances. Prescribing vancomycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. (5.6) 5.1 Oral Use Only This preparation for the treatment of colitis is for oral use only and is not systemically absorbed. Vancomycin hydrochloride capsules must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Orally administered vancomycin hydrochloride capsules are not effective for other types of infections. Parenteral administration of vancomycin is not effective for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile-associated diarrhea. If parenteral vancomycin therapy is desired, use an intravenous preparation of vancomycin and consult the package insert accompanying that preparation. 5.2 Potential for Systemic Absorption Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of vancomycin for active C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Some patients with inflammatory disorders of the intestinal mucosa also may have significant systemic absorption of vancomycin. These patients may be at risk for the development of adverse reactions associated with higher doses of vancomycin hydrochloride; therefore, monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be appropriate in some instances, e.g., in patients with renal insufficiency and/or colitis or in those receiving concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside antibiotic. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) has occurred following oral vancomycin hydrochloride therapy in randomized controlled clinical studies, and can occur either during or after completion of therapy.

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Medical Affairs at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to vancomycin hydrochloride in 260 adult subjects in two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of diarrhea associated with C. difficile . In both trials, subjects received vancomycin hydrochloride 125 mg orally four times daily. The mean duration of treatment was 9.4 days. The median age of patients was 67, ranging between 19 and 96 years of age. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (93%) and 52% were male. Adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of vancomycin hydrochloride-treated subjects are shown in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions associated with vancomycin hydrochloride (>= 10%) were nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia. Table 1: Common ( >= 5%) Adverse Reactionsa for Vancomycin Hydrochloride Reported in Clinical Trials for Treatment of Diarrhea Associated with C. difficile System / Organ Class Adverse Reaction Vancomycin Hydrochloride % (N=260) Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea Abdominal pain Vomiting Diarrhea Flatulence 17 15 9 9 8 General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia Edema peripheral Fatigue 9 6 5 Infections and infestations Urinary tract infection 8 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Hypokalemia 13 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Back pain 6 Nervous system disorders Headache 7 a Adverse reaction rates were derived from the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) occurred in 5% of subjects treated with vancomycin hydrochloride. Nephrotoxicity following vancomycin hydrochloride typically first occurred within one week after completion of treatment (median day of onset was Day 16). Nephrotoxicity following vancomycin hydrochloride occurred in 6% of subjects >65 years of age and 3% of subjects <=65 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions, Nephrotoxicity (5.3)] . The incidences of hypokalemia, urinary tract infection, peripheral edema, insomnia, constipation, anemia, depression, vomiting, and hypotension were higher among subjects >65 years of age than in subjects <=65 years of age [see Use In Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5)] . Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects treated with vancomycin hydrochloride. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of vancomycin hydrochloride were C. difficile colitis (<1%), nausea (<1%), and vomiting (<1%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of vancomycin hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ototoxicity : Cases of hearing loss associated with intravenously administered vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a pre-existing hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug [see Warnings and Precautions, Ototoxicity (5.4) ] . Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported. Hematopoietic : Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of intravenous therapy with vancomycin or after a total dose of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has been reported. Miscellaneous: Patients have been reported to have had anaphylaxis, drug fever, chills, nausea, eosinophilia, rashes (including exfoliative dermatitis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and rare cases of vasculitis in association with the administration of vancomycin. A condition has been reported that is similar to the IV-induced syndrome with symptoms consistent with anaphylactoid reactions, including hypotension, wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the upper body ("Red Man Syndrome"), pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours.",
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vancomycin hydrochloride must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile -associated diarrhea. Orally administered vancomycin hydrochloride capsules are not effective for other types of infections. (5.1) Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of vancomycin hydrochloride for active C. difficile -associated diarrhea. Monitoring of serum concentrations may be appropriate in some instances. (5.2) Nephrotoxicity has occurred following oral vancomycin hydrochloride therapy and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk is increased in geriatric patients. (5.3) Monitor renal function. Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin hydrochloride. (5.4) Assessment of auditory function may be appropriate in some instances. Prescribing vancomycin hydrochloride in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. (5.6) 5.1 Oral Use Only This preparation for the treatment of colitis is for oral use only and is not systemically absorbed. Vancomycin hydrochloride capsules must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Orally administered vancomycin hydrochloride capsules are not effective for other types of infections. Parenteral administration of vancomycin is not effective for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile-associated diarrhea. If parenteral vancomycin therapy is desired, use an intravenous preparation of vancomycin and consult the package insert accompanying that preparation. 5.2 Potential for Systemic Absorption Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of vancomycin for active C. difficile -associated diarrhea. Some patients with inflammatory disorders of the intestinal mucosa also may have significant systemic absorption of vancomycin. These patients may be at risk for the development of adverse reactions associated with higher doses of vancomycin; therefore, monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be appropriate in some instances, e.g., in patients with renal insufficiency and/or colitis or in those receiving concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside antibiotic. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) has occurred following oral vancomycin hydrochloride therapy in randomized controlled clinical studies, and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk of nephrotoxicity is increased in patients >65 years of age [see Adverse Reactions, Clinical Trial Experience (6.1) and Use In Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5) ] . In patients >65 years of age, including those with normal renal function prior to treatment, renal function should be monitored during and following treatment with vancomycin hydrochloride to detect potential vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity. 5.4 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin. It may be transient or permanent. It has been reported mostly in patients who have been given excessive intravenous doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside. Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity [see Adverse Reactions, Postmarketing Experience (6.2) ]. 5.5 Superinfection Use of vancomycin may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing vancomycin hydrochloride in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.",

Hematopoietic Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of therapy with vancomycin or after a total dosage of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has rarely been reported. Although a casual relationship has not been established, reversible agranulocytosis (granulocytes <500/mm3) has been reported rarely. Phlebitis Inflammation at the injection site has been reported. Miscellaneous Infrequently, patients have been reported to have had anaphylaxis, drug fever, nausea, chills, eosinophilia, rashes including exfoliative dermatitis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and vasculitis in association with administration of vancomycin. Chemical peritonitis has been reported following intraperitoneal administration of vancomycin (see PRECAUTIONS ). Post Marketing Reports The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of vancomycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-308-6755 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to VANCOCIN in 260 adult subjects in two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of diarrhea associated with C. difficile. In both trials, subjects received VANCOCIN 125 mg orally four times daily. The mean duration of treatment was 9.4 days. The median age of patients was 67, ranging between 19 and 96 years of age. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (93%) and 52% were male. Adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of VANCOCIN-treated subjects are shown in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions associated with VANCOCIN (>= 10%) were nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia. Table 1: Common (>= 5%) Adverse Reactionsa for VANCOCIN Reported in Clinical Trials for Treatment of Diarrhea Associated with C. difficile a Adverse reaction rates were derived from the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. System/Organ Class Adverse Reaction VANCOCIN % (N=260) Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea Abdominal pain Vomiting Diarrhea Flatulence 17 15 9 9 8 General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia Edema peripheral Fatigue 9 6 5 Infections and infestations Urinary tract infection 8 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Hypokalemia 13 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Back pain 6 Nervous system disorders Headache 7 Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) occurred in 5% of subjects treated with VANCOCIN. Nephrotoxicity following VANCOCIN typically first occurred within one week after completion of treatment (median day of onset was Day 16). Nephrotoxicity following VANCOCIN occurred in 6% of subjects >65 years of age and 3% of subjects <=65 years of age (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Nephrotoxicity [5.3]). The incidences of hypokalemia, urinary tract infection, peripheral edema, insomnia, constipation, anemia, depression, vomiting, and hypotension were higher among subjects >65 years of age than in subjects <=65 years of age (see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS, Geriatric Use [8.5]). Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects treated with VANCOCIN. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of VANCOCIN were C. difficile colitis (<1%), nausea (<1%), and vomiting (<1%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VANCOCIN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ototoxicity: Cases of hearing loss associated with intravenously administered vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a preexisting hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Ototoxicity [5.4]). Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported. Hematopoietic: Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of intravenous therapy with vancomycin or after a total dose of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - VANCOCIN must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Orally administered VANCOCIN CAPSULES are not effective for other types of infections. (5.1) -Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of VANCOCIN for active C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Monitoring of serum concentrations may be appropriate in some instances. (5.2) -Nephrotoxicity has occurred following oral VANCOCIN therapy and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk is increased in geriatric patients. (5.3) Monitor renal function. -Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving VANCOCIN. (5.4) Assessment of auditory function may be appropriate in some instances. -Prescribing VANCOCIN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. (5.6) 5.1 Oral Use Only This preparation for the treatment of colitis is for oral use only and is not systemically absorbed. VANCOCIN CAPSULES must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Orally administered VANCOCIN CAPSULES are not effective for other types of infections. Parenteral administration of vancomycin is not effective for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile-associated diarrhea. If parenteral vancomycin therapy is desired, use an intravenous preparation of vancomycin and consult the package insert accompanying that preparation. 5.2 Potential for Systemic Absorption Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of VANCOCIN for active C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Some patients with inflammatory disorders of the intestinal mucosa also may have significant systemic absorption of vancomycin. These patients may be at risk for the development of adverse reactions associated with higher doses of VANCOCIN; therefore, monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be appropriate in some instances, e.g., in patients with renal insufficiency and/or colitis or in those receiving concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside antibiotic. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) has occurred following oral VANCOCIN therapy in randomized controlled clinical studies, and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk of nephrotoxicity is increased in patients >65 years of age (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Clinical Trial Experience [6.1] and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS, Geriatric Use [8.5]). In patients >65 years of age, including those with normal renal function prior to treatment, renal function should be monitored during and following treatment with VANCOCIN to detect potential vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity. 5.4 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin. It may be transient or permanent. It has been reported mostly in patients who have been given excessive intravenous doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside. Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience [6.2]). 5.5 Superinfection Use of VANCOCIN may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing VANCOCIN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria."

The data described below reflect exposure to vancomycin hydrochloride in 260 adult subjects in two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of diarrhea associated with C. difficile . In both trials, subjects received vancomycin hydrochloride 125 mg orally four times daily. The mean duration of treatment was 9.4 days. The median age of patients was 67, ranging between 19 and 96 years of age. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (93%) and 52% were male. Adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of vancomycin hydrochloride-treated subjects are shown in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions associated with vancomycin hydrochloride (>= 10%) were nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia.

Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) occurred in 5% of subjects treated with vancomycin hydrochloride. Nephrotoxicity following vancomycin hydrochloride typically first occurred within one week after completion of treatment (median day of onset was Day 16). Nephrotoxicity following vancomycin hydrochloride occurred in 6% of subjects >65 years of age and 3% of subjects <=65 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions, Nephrotoxicity (5.3)] . The incidences of hypokalemia, urinary tract infection, peripheral edema, insomnia, constipation, anemia, depression, vomiting, and hypotension were higher among subjects >65 years of age than in subjects <=65 years of age [see Use In Specific Populations, Geriatric Use (8.5)] . Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects treated with vancomycin hydrochloride. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of vancomycin hydrochloride were C. difficile colitis (<1%), nausea (<1%), and vomiting (<1%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of vancomycin hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ototoxicity : Cases of hearing loss associated with intravenously administered vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a pre-existing hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug [see Warnings and Precautions, Ototoxicity (5.4) ] . Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported. Hematopoietic : Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of intravenous therapy with vancomycin or after a total dose of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has been reported.

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-308-6755 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules in 260 adult subjects in two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of diarrhea associated with C. difficile. In both trials, subjects received Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules 125 mg orally four times daily. The mean duration of treatment was 9.4 days. The median age of patients was 67, ranging between 19 and 96 years of age. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (93%) and 52% were male. Adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsule-treated subjects are shown in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions associated with Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules (>= 10%) were nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia. Table 1: Common (>= 5%) Adverse Reactionsa for Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules Reported in Clinical Trials for Treatment of Diarrhea Associated with C. difficile a Adverse reaction rates were derived from the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. System/Organ Class Adverse Reaction Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules % (N=260) Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea Abdominal pain Vomiting Diarrhea Flatulence 17 15 9 9 8 General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia Edema peripheral Fatigue 9 6 5 Infections and infestations Urinary tract infection 8 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Hypokalemia 13 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Back pain 6 Nervous system disorders Headache 7 Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) occurred in 5% of subjects treated with Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules. Nephrotoxicity following Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules typically first occurred within one week after completion of treatment (median day of onset was Day 16). Nephrotoxicity following Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules occurred in 6% of subjects >65 years of age and 3% of subjects <=65 years of age (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Nephrotoxicity [5.3]). The incidences of hypokalemia, urinary tract infection, peripheral edema, insomnia, constipation, anemia, depression, vomiting, and hypotension were higher among subjects >65 years of age than in subjects <=65 years of age (see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS, Geriatric Use [8.5]). Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects treated with Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules were C. difficile colitis (<1%), nausea (<1%), and vomiting (<1%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ototoxicity: Cases of hearing loss associated with intravenously administered vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a preexisting hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Ototoxicity [5.4]). Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported. Hematopoietic: Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of intravenous therapy with vancomycin or after a total dose of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has been reported. Miscellaneous: Patients have been reported to have had anaphylaxis, drug fever, chills, nausea, eosinophilia, rashes (including exfoliative dermatitis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and rare cases of vasculitis in association with the administration of vancomycin. A condition has been reported that is similar to the IV-induced syndrome with symptoms consistent with anaphylactoid reactions, including hypotension, wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the upper body ("Red Man Syndrome"), pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Orally administered Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules are not effective for other types of infections. (5.1) Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules for active C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Monitoring of serum concentrations may be appropriate in some instances. (5.2) Nephrotoxicity has occurred following oral Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsule therapy and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk is increased in geriatric patients. (5.3) Monitor renal function. Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules. (5.4) Assessment of auditory function may be appropriate in some instances. Prescribing Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. (5.6) 5.1 Oral Use Only This preparation for the treatment of colitis is for oral use only and is not systemically absorbed. Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Orally administered Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules are not effective for other types of infections. Parenteral administration of vancomycin is not effective for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile-associated diarrhea. If parenteral vancomycin therapy is desired, use an intravenous preparation of vancomycin and consult the package insert accompanying that preparation. 5.2 Potential for Systemic Absorption Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules for active C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Some patients with inflammatory disorders of the intestinal mucosa also may have significant systemic absorption of vancomycin. These patients may be at risk for the development of adverse reactions associated with higher doses of Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules; therefore, monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be appropriate in some instances, e.g., in patients with renal insufficiency and/or colitis or in those receiving concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside antibiotic. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) has occurred following oral Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsule therapy in randomized controlled clinical studies, and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk of nephrotoxicity is increased in patients >65 years of age (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Clinical Trial Experience [6.1] and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS, Geriatric Use [8.5]). In patients >65 years of age, including those with normal renal function prior to treatment, renal function should be monitored during and following treatment with Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules to detect potential vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity. 5.4 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin. It may be transient or permanent. It has been reported mostly in patients who have been given excessive intravenous doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside. Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience [6.2]). 5.5 Superinfection Use of Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Vancomycin Hydrochloride Capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>= 10%) were nausea (17%), abdominal pain (15%), and hypokalemia (13%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Watson Laboratories, Inc. at (1-800-272-5525) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 (www.fda.gov/medwatch). 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to vancomycin in 260 adult subjects in two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of diarrhea associated with C. difficile. In both trials, subjects received vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily. The mean duration of treatment was 9.4 days. The median age of patients was 67, ranging between 19 and 96 years of age. Patients were predominantly Caucasian (93%) and 52% were male. Adverse reactions occurring in >= 5% of vancomycin-treated subjects are shown in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions associated with vancomycin (>= 10%) were nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia. Table 1: Common (>= 5%) Adverse Reactionsa for Vancomycin Reported in Clinical Trials for Treatment of Diarrhea Associated with C. difficile System/Organ Class Adverse Reaction V ancomycin % (N=260) Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea Abdominal pain Vomiting Diarrhea Flatulence 17 15 9 9 8 General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia Edema peripheral Fatigue 9 6 5 Infections and infestations Urinary tract infection 8 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Hypokalemia 13 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Back pain 6 Nervous system disorders Headache 7 a Adverse reaction rates were derived from the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) occurred in 5% of subjects treated with vancomycin. Nephrotoxicity following vancomycin typically first occurred within one week after completion of treatment (median day of onset was Day 16). Nephrotoxicity following vancomycin occurred in 6% of subjects >65 years of age and 3% of subjects <=65 years of age (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , Nephrotoxicity [ 5.3 ]). The incidences of hypokalemia, urinary tract infection, peripheral edema, insomnia, constipation, anemia, depression, vomiting, and hypotension were higher among subjects >65 years of age than in subjects <=65 years of age (see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS , Geriatric Use [ 8.5 ]). Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects treated with vancomycin. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of vancomycin were C. difficile colitis (<1%), nausea (<1%), and vomiting (<1%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of vancomycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ototoxicity: Cases of hearing loss associated with intravenously administered vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a preexisting hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , Ototoxicity [ 5.4 ]). Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported. Hematopoietic: Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of intravenous therapy with vancomycin or after a total dose of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has been reported. Miscellaneous: Patients have been reported to have had anaphylaxis, drug fever, chills, nausea, eosinophilia, rashes (including exfoliative dermatitis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and rare cases of vasculitis in association with the administration of vancomycin. A condition has been reported that is similar to the IV-induced syndrome with symptoms consistent with anaphylactoid reactions, including hypotension, wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the upper body ("Red Man Syndrome"), pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Vancomycin hydrochloride capsules, USP must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile -associated diarrhea. Orally administered vancomycin hydrochloride capsules, USP are not effective for other types of infections. ( 5.1 ) Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of vancomycin hydrochloride capsules, USP for active C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Monitoring of serum concentrations may be appropriate in some instances. (5.2) Nephrotoxicity has occurred following oral vancomycin hydrochloride capsules, USP therapy and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk is increased in geriatric patients (5.3) Monitor renal function. Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin hydrochloride capsules, USP. (5.4) Assessment of auditory function may be appropriate in some instances. Prescribing vancomycin hydrochloride capsules, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. (5.6) 5.1 Oral Use Only This preparation for the treatment of colitis is for oral use only and is not systemically absorbed. Vancomycin hydrochloride capsules, USP must be given orally for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea. Orally administered vancomycin hydrochloride capsules, USP are not effective for other types of infections. Parenteral administration of vancomycin is not effective for treatment of staphylococcal enterocolitis and C. difficile -associated diarrhea. If parenteral vancomycin therapy is desired, use an intravenous preparation of vancomycin and consult the package insert accompanying that preparation. 5.2 Potential for Systemic Absorption Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients who have taken multiple oral doses of vancomycin for active C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Some patients with inflammatory disorders of the intestinal mucosa also may have significant systemic absorption of vancomycin. These patients may be at risk for the development of adverse reactions associated with higher doses of vancomycin; therefore, monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be appropriate in some instances, e.g., in patients with renal insufficiency and/or colitis or in those receiving concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside antibiotic. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity (e.g., reports of renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) has occurred following oral vancomycin therapy in randomized controlled clinical studies, and can occur either during or after completion of therapy. The risk of nephrotoxicity is increased in patients >65 years of age (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Clinical Trial Experience [ 6.1 ] and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS , Geriatric Use [ 8.5 ]). In patients >65 years of age, including those with normal renal function prior to treatment, renal function should be monitored during and following treatment with vancomycin to detect potential vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity. 5.4 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin. It may be transient or permanent. It has been reported mostly in patients who have been given excessive intravenous doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside. Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Postmarketing Experience [ 6.2 ]). 5.5 Superinfection Use of vancomycin may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing vancomycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria."

      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Infusion-Related Events During or soon after rapid infusion of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection, patients may develop anaphylactoid reactions, including hypotension (see ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY ), wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, or pruritus. Rapid infusion may also cause flushing of the upper body (‘‘red neck'') or pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours. Such events are infrequent if vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is given by a slow infusion over 60 minutes. In studies of normal volunteers, infusion-related events did not occur when vancomycin hydrochloride for injection was administered at a rate of 10 mg/min or less. Nephrotoxicity Renal failure, principally manifested by increased serum creatinine or BUN concentrations, especially in patients administered large doses of vancomycin, has been reported rarely. Cases of interstitial nephritis have also been reported rarely. Most of these have occurred in patients who were given aminoglycosides concomitantly or who had preexisting kidney dysfunction. When vancomycin was discontinued, azotemia resolved in most patients. Gastrointestinal Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment (see WARNINGS ). Ototoxicity A few dozen cases of hearing loss associated with vancomycin have been reported. Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a preexisting hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug. Vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have been reported rarely. Hematopoietic Reversible neutropenia, usually starting 1 week or more after onset of therapy with vancomycin or after a total dosage of more than 25 g, has been reported for several dozen patients. Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued. Thrombocytopenia has rarely been reported. Although a causal relationship has not been established, reversible agranulocytosis (granulocytes <500/mm3) has been reported rarely. Phlebitis Inflammation at the injection site has been reported. Miscellaneous Infrequently, patients have been reported to have had anaphylaxis, drug fever, nausea, chills, eosinophilia, rashes including exfoliative dermatitis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and vasculitis in association with the administration of vancomycin. Chemical peritonitis has been reported following intraperitoneal administration of vancomycin (see PRECAUTIONS ). Post Marketing Reports The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of vancomycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
