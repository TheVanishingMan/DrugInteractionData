        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects of Orphenadrine Citrate, Aspirin, and Caffeine Tablets are those seen with aspirin and caffeine or those usually associated with mild anticholinergic agents. These may include tachycardia, palpitation, urinary hesitancy or retention, dry mouth, blurred vision, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular tension, weakness, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, constipation, drowsiness, and rarely, urticaria and other dermatoses. Infrequently, an elderly patient may experience some degree of confusion. Mild central excitation and occasional hallucinations may be observed. These mild side effects can usually be eliminated by reduction in dosage. One case of aplastic anemia associated with the use of Orphenadrine Citrate, Aspirin, and Caffeine Tablets has been reported. No causal relationship has been established. Rare G.I. hemorrhage due to aspirin content may be associated with the administration of Orphenadrine Citrate, Aspirin, and Caffeine Tablets. Some patients may experience transient episodes of lightheadedness, dizziness or syncope."
