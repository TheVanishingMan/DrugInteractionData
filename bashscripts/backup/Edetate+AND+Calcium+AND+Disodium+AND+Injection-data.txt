        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse effects have been associated with the use of edetate calcium disodium: Body as a Whole: pain at intramuscular injection site, fever, chills, malaise, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia. Cardiovascular: hypotension, cardiac rhythm irregularities. Renal: acute necrosis of proximal tubules (which may result in fatal nephrosis), infrequent changes in distal tubules and glomeruli. Urinary: glycosuria, proteinuria, microscopic hematuria and large epithelial cells in urinary sediment. Nervous System: tremors, headache, numbness, tingling. Gastrointestinal: cheilosis, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, excessive thirst. Hepatic: mild increases in SGOT and SGPT are common, and return to normal within 48 hours after cessation of therapy. Immunogenic: histamine-like reactions (sneezing, nasal congestion, lacrimation), rash. Hematopoietic: transient bone marrow depression, anemia. Metabolic: zinc deficiency, hypercalcemia."
