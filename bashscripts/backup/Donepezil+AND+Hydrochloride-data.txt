Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7 day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablets cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg or 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1) Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2) Donepezil hydrochloride tablets can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3) Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4) Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6) Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7) Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8) 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7 day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC and C ) by 36%.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30 week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6 week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2 Table 2.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in or , COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leadin g to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Weight Loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Genitourinary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Neurological Conditions: Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Pulmonary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Jubilant Cadista Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-313-4623 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride (n=350) % 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride (n=315) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue, and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15- and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo), and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo).

Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Common Adverse Reactions with Donepezil Hydrochloride 23 mg/day The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse reactions in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride with or without memantine. Table 6.

Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). -A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1. Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-Ranbaxy (726-2299) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% < 1% 3% Vomiting < 1% < 1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride‘s cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Donepezil hydrochloride tablets have been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets (n=350) % 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets (n=315) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablets' cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue, and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15-and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo), and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablets' cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg or 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo.

Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride tablets 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Common Adverse Reactions with Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets 23 mg/day The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride tablets and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse reactions in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride tablets with or without memantine. Table 6.

These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity.

Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions.

However, studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean K about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. in vivo in vitro i Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism . Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7 day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC and C ) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. in vitro 0-24 max Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in or , COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia ( ). 5.1 Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block ( ). 5.2 Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases ( ). 5.3 Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers ( ). 5.4 Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions ( ). 5.6 Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions ( ). 5.7 Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease ( ). 5.8 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Enter section text here Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1. Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. A small effect of CYP2D6 inhibitors was identified in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma donepezil concentrations measured in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil clearance was reduced by approximately 17% in patients taking 10 mg in combination with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor. This result is consistent with the conclusion that CYP2D6 is a minor metabolic pathway of donepezil. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Enter section text here The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ranbaxy Pharmaceuitcals Inc., at 1-888-Ranbaxy (726-2299) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% < 1% 3% Vomiting < 1% < 1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies.

Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications ( 7.2 ). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists ( 7.3 ). 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7 day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7 day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation From Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/% Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% < 1% 3% Vomiting < 1% < 1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30 week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6 week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia ( 5.1 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block ( 5.2 ). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases ( 5.3 ). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers ( 5.4 ). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions ( 5.6 ). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions ( 5.7 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease ( 5.8 ). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Donepezil hydrochloride tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Oral administration of donepezil to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not produce any teratogenic effects at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 23 mg/day on a mg/m 2basis) and 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2basis), respectively. Oral administration of donepezil (1, 3, 10 mg/kg/day) to rats during late gestation and throughout lactation to weaning produced an increase in stillbirths and reduced offspring survival through postpartum day 4 at the highest dose. The no-effect dose of 3 mg/kg/day is approximately equal to the MRHD on a mg/m 2basis."

These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: -Cardiovascular Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] -Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] -Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] -Weight Loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] -Genitourinary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] -Neurological Conditions: Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] -Pulmonary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( 6.1). 6.1. Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day Donepezil (n=350) 10 mg/day Donepezil (n=315) Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2 Comparison of Rates of Adverse Reactions in Mild to Moderate Patients Titrated to 10 mg/day over 1 and 6 Weeks No titration One week titration Six week titration Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=315) % 5 mg/day (n=311) % 10 mg/day (n=315) % 10 mg/day (n=269) % Nausea 6 5 19 6 Diarrhea 5 8 15 9 Insomnia 6 6 14 6 Fatigue 3 4 8 3 Vomiting 3 3 8 5 Muscle cramps 2 6 8 3 Anorexia 2 3 7 3 Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received either donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg or 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse reactions occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reaction The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg and 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Common Adverse Reactions with Donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse events in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride with or without memantine. Table 6.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Abdominal pain, agitation, aggression, cholecystitis, confusion, convulsions, hallucinations, heart block (all types), hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, hyponatremia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, pancreatitis,rash, rhabdomyolysis, QTc prolongation, and torsade de pointes."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -The use of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%) 5.5. Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1 Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride tablets on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride tablets have any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride tablets for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride tablets on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride tablets is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness. Cardiovascular System: Frequent: hypertension, vasodilation, atrial fibrillation, hot flashes, hypotension; Infrequent: angina pectoris, postural hypotension, myocardial infarction, AV block (first degree), congestive heart failure, arteritis, bradycardia, peripheral vascular disease, supraventricular tachycardia, deep vein thrombosis.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablet's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride tablets can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a predictable consequence of their pharmacological properties, have been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.5 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.6 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.7 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). -A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Jubilant Cadista Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-313-4623 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2. Comparison of Rates of Adverse Events in Mild to Moderate Patients Titrated to 10 mg/day over 1 and 6 Weeks No titration One week titration Six week titration Adverse Event Placebo (n=315) 5 mg/day (n=311) 10 mg/day (n=315) 10 mg/day (n=269) Nausea 6% 5% 19% 6% Diarrhea 5% 8% 15% 9% Insomnia 6% 6% 14% 6% Fatigue 3% 4% 8% 3% Vomiting 3% 3% 8% 5% Muscle cramps 2% 6% 8% 3% Anorexia 2% 3% 7% 3% Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets 23 mg/day Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease Donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day has been administered to over 1300 individuals globally in clinical trials. Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day due to adverse events was higher (18.6%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (7.9%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of 23 mg The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of a controlled clinical trial in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 6 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse events in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride with or without memantine. Table 6.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -The use of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse event in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride (n=350) % 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride (n=315) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue, and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15- and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo), and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg or 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Common Adverse Reactions with Donepezil Hydrochloride 23 mg/day The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse reactions in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride with or without memantine. Table 6.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Abdominal pain, agitation, aggression, cholecystitis, confusion, convulsions, hallucinations, heart block (all types), hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, hyponatremia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, pancreatitis, rash, rhabdomyolysis, QTc prolongation, and torsade de pointes."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1) Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2) Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3) Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4) The use of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5) Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6) Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7) Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8) 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "Drug Interactions Section Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro . Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects.

        "Warnings And Precautions Section Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1. Effect of Donepezil HCl on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil HCl on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 µM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil HCl on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil HCl Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. A small effect of CYP2D6 inhibitors was identified in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma donepezil concentrations measured in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil clearance was reduced by approximately 17% in patients taking 10 mg in combination with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor. This result is consistent with the conclusion that CYP2D6 is a minor metabolic pathway of donepezil. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil HCl are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Donepezil HCl 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil HCl due to adverse events for the donepezil 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil HCl 10 mg/day Donepezil HCl Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil HCl The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil HCl treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil HCl and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil HCl than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil HCl. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil HCl treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil HCl due to adverse events for the donepezil HCl-treated patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil HCl-treated patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil HCl The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil HCl and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil HCl treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil HCl and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil HCl than with placebo.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1 Effects of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effects of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg / day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg / day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized Event /% Discontinuing 355 350 315 Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2Comparison of Rates of Adverse Events in Mild to Moderate Patients Titrated to 10 mg/day over 1 and 6 Weeks No titration One week titration Six week titration Adverse Event Placebo ( n = 315 ) 5 mg / day ( n = 311 ) 10 mg / day ( n = 315 ) 10 mg / day ( n = 269 ) Nausea 6% 5% 19% 6% Diarrhea 5% 8% 15% 9% Insomnia 6% 6% 14% 6% Fatigue 3% 4% 8% 3% Vomiting 3% 3% 8% 5% Muscle cramps 2% 6% 8% 3% Anorexia 2% 3% 7% 3% Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Weight Loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Genitourinary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Neurological Conditions: Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Pulmonary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Citron Pharma LLC. at 1-855-5-CITRON (1-855-524-8766) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride (n=350) % 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride (n=315) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue, and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15- and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo), and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg or 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Common Adverse Reactions with Donepezil Hydrochloride 23 mg/day The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse reactions in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride with or without memantine. Table 6.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1) Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2) Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3) Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4) The use of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5) Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6) Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7) Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8) 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications ( 7.3 ). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists ( 7.4 ). 7.1. Effect of ARICEPT on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of ARICEPT on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether ARICEPT has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of ARICEPT for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of ARICEPT on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of ARICEPT Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. A small effect of CYP2D6 inhibitors was identified in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma donepezil concentrations measured in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil clearance was reduced by approximately 17% in patients taking 10 or 23 mg in combination with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor. This result is consistent with the conclusion that CYP2D6 is a minor metabolic pathway of donepezil. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of ARICEPT. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of ARICEPT is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

Clinical Studies Experience ARICEPT 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due to adverse events for the ARICEPT 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued ARICEPT treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received ARICEPT and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with ARICEPT than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving ARICEPT. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to ARICEPT treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due to adverse events for the ARICEPT patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of ARICEPT patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of ARICEPT The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving ARICEPT and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by ARICEPT's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued ARICEPT treatment without the need for dose modification.

ARICEPT 23 mg/day Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease ARICEPT 23 mg/day has been administered to over 1300 individuals globally in clinical trials. Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of ARICEPT 23 mg/day due to adverse events was higher (18.6%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (7.9%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of 23 mg The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of a controlled clinical trial in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia ( 5.1 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block ( 5.2 ). ARICEPT can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases ( 5.3 ). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers ( 5.4 ). The use of ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss ( 5.5 ). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions ( 5.6 ). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions ( 5.7 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease ( 5.8 ). 5.1. Anesthesia ARICEPT, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of ARICEPT. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting ARICEPT, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of ARICEPT, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of ARICEPT in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%) 5.5. Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse event in 4.7% of patients assigned to ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6. Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of ARICEPT, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7. Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8. Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Donepezil Hydrochloride 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15- and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications ( ). 7.3 A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists ( ). 7.4 7.1 Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride tablets on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean K about 50-130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. in vivo in vitro i Whether donepezil hydrochloride tablets have any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride tablets for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride tablets on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism . Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC and C ) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. in vitro 0-24 max Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride tablets is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( ). 6.1 To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-269-544-2299 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg / day Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets 10 mg / day Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event /% Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablet's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia ( ). 5.1 Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block ( ). 5.2 Donepezil hydrochloride tablets can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases ( ). 5.3 Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers ( ). 5.4 Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions ( ). 5.6 Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions ( ). 5.7 Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease ( ). 5.8 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a predictable consequence of their pharmacological properties, have been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.5 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.6 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.7 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2.

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Solco Healthcare US, LLC at 1-866-257-2597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1. Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

DRUG INTERACTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). -A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). 7.1. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Solco Healthcare U. S., LLC at 1-866-257-2597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2. Comparison of Rates of Adverse Events in Mild to Moderate Patients Titrated to 10 mg/day over 1 and 6 Weeks No titration One week titration Six week titration Adverse Event Placebo (n=315) 5 mg/day (n=311) 10 mg/day (n=315) 10 mg/day (n=269) Nausea 6% 5% 19% 6% Diarrhea 5% 8% 15% 9% Insomnia 6% 6% 14% 6% Fatigue 3% 4% 8% 3% Vomiting 3% 3% 8% 5% Muscle cramps 2% 6% 8% 3% Anorexia 2% 3% 7% 3% Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of donepezil hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

Donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease Donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day has been administered to over 1300 individuals globally in clinical trials. Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day due to adverse events was higher (18.6%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (7.9%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of 23 mg The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of a controlled clinical trial in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 6 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse events in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride with or without memantine. Table 6.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -The use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse event in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. 7.2 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-269-544-2299 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride tablets can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a predictable consequence of their pharmacological properties, have been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications ( 7.3 ). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists ( 7.4 ). 7.1. Effect of ARICEPT on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of ARICEPT on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether ARICEPT has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of ARICEPT for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of ARICEPT on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of ARICEPT Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. A small effect of CYP2D6 inhibitors was identified in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma donepezil concentrations measured in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil clearance was reduced by approximately 17% in patients taking 10 or 23 mg in combination with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor. This result is consistent with the conclusion that CYP2D6 is a minor metabolic pathway of donepezil. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of ARICEPT. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of ARICEPT is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of ARICEPT are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eisai Inc. at 1-888-274-2378 (fax 1-201-746-3207) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience ARICEPT 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due to adverse events for the ARICEPT 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day ARICEPT 10 mg/day ARICEPT Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of ARICEPT The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by ARICEPT's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued ARICEPT treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2. Comparison of Rates of Adverse Events in Mild to Moderate Patients Titrated to 10 mg/day over 1 and 6 Weeks No titration One week titration Six week titration Adverse Event Placebo (n=315) 5 mg/day (n=311) 10 mg/day (n=315) 10 mg/day (n=269) Nausea 6% 5% 19% 6% Diarrhea 5% 8% 15% 9% Insomnia 6% 6% 14% 6% Fatigue 3% 4% 8% 3% Vomiting 3% 3% 8% 5% Muscle cramps 2% 6% 8% 3% Anorexia 2% 3% 7% 3% Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received ARICEPT and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with ARICEPT than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving ARICEPT. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to ARICEPT treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due to adverse events for the ARICEPT patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of ARICEPT patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of ARICEPT The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving ARICEPT and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by ARICEPT's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued ARICEPT treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received ARICEPT and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with ARICEPT than with placebo.

ARICEPT 23 mg/day Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease ARICEPT 23 mg/day has been administered to over 1300 individuals globally in clinical trials. Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of ARICEPT 23 mg/day due to adverse events was higher (18.6%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (7.9%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of 23 mg The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of a controlled clinical trial in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 6 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of ARICEPT and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of ARICEPT in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse events in patients taking ARICEPT with or without memantine. Table 6.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia ( 5,1 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block ( 5.2 ). ARICEPT can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases ( 5.3 ). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers ( 5.4 ). The use of ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss ( 5.5 ). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions ( 5.6 ). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions ( 5.7 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease ( 5.8 ). 5.1. Anesthesia ARICEPT, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of ARICEPT. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting ARICEPT, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of ARICEPT, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of ARICEPT in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%) 5.5. Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse event in 4.7% of patients assigned to ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6. Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of ARICEPT, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7. Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8. Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "Adverse Reactions Section The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact CARACO Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "Warnings And Precautions Section Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). -A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed tohave some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). 7.1. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild To Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day, was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg/day donepezil hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2. Comparison of Rates of Adverse Events in Mild to Moderate Patients Titrated to 10 mg/day over 1 and 6 Weeks No titration One week titration Six week titration Adverse Event Placebo (n=315) 5 mg/day (n=311) 10 mg/day (n=315) 10 mg/day (n=269) Nausea 6% 5% 19% 6% Diarrhea 5% 8% 15% 9% Insomnia 6% 6% 14% 6% Fatigue 3% 4% 8% 3% Vomiting 3% 3% 8% 5% Muscle cramps 2% 6% 8% 3% Anorexia 2% 3% 7% 3% Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2) Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding (GI), especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloridein a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6. Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7. Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8. Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ScieGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-724-3436 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day donepezil hydrochloride (n=350) % 10 mg/day donepezil hydrochloride (n=315) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Common Adverse Reactions with Donepezil Hydrochloride 23 mg/day The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse reactions in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride with or without memantine. Table 6.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). The use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Genitourinary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Neurological Conditions: Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Pulmonary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7 day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo ( n = 355 ) % 5 mg / day Donepezil Hydrochloride ( n = 350 ) % 10 mg / day Donepezil Hydrochloride ( n = 315 ) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30 week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6 week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablets' cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo.

Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets 23 mg/day Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease Donepezil hydrochloride tablets 23 mg/day have been administered to over 1300 individuals globally in clinical trials. Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride tablets 23 mg/day due to adverse events was higher (18.6%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (7.9%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of 23 mg The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of a controlled clinical trial in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 6 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride tablets and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse events in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride tablets with or without memantine. Table 6.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride tablets can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). The use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, have been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse event in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1. Effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP2D6 (e.g., imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-ward Pharmaceuticals 1-877-233-2001 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil HydrochlorideTablets 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% < 1% 3% Vomiting < 1% < 1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies.

Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-269-544-2299 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Genitourinary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Neurological Conditions: Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Pulmonary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Donepezil hydrochloride tablets have been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1 .

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15- and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2 .

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablet's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg and 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1 Effects of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effects of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies.

Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.5 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.6 Neurological Conditions Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.7 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Weight Loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Genitourinary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Neurological Conditions: Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Pulmonary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 ClinicalTrials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Donepezil hydrochloride tablets have been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1,200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets (n=350) % 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets (n=315) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue, and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15- and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2. Comparison of Rates of Adverse Reactions in Mild to Moderate Patients Titrated to 10 mg/day over 1 and 6 Weeks No titration One week titration Six week titration Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=315) 5 mg/day (n=311) 10 mg/day (n=315) 10 mg/day (n=269) % % % % Nausea 6 5 19 6 Diarrhea 5 8 15 9 Insomnia 6 6 14 6 Fatigue 3 4 8 3 Vomiting 3 3 8 5 Muscle cramps 2 6 8 3 Anorexia 2 3 7 3 Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received either donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg or 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo. In general, adverse reactions occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo), and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg or 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo.

Approximately 1,050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride tablets 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Common Adverse Reactions with donepezil hydrochloride tablets 23 mg/day The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride tablets and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse reactions in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride with or without memantine. Table 6.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Abdominal pain, agitation, aggression, cholecystitis, confusion, convulsions, hallucinations, heart block (all types), hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, hyponatremia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, pancreatitis, rash, rhabdomyolysis, QTc prolongation, and torsade de pointes."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1) Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2) Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3) Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4) The use of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5) Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6) Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7) Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8) 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). 7.1. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets 23 mg/day Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease Donepezil hydrochloride tablets 23 mg/day has been administered to over 1300 individuals globally in clinical trials. Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day due to adverse events was higher (18.6%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (7.9%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of 23 mg The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of a controlled clinical trial in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 6 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse events in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride with or without memantine. Table 6.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). The use of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5) Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5. Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse event in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/% Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day donepezil hydrochloride (n=350) % 10 mg/day donepezil hydrochloride (n=315) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg or 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Common Adverse Reactions with Donepezil Hydrochloride 23 mg/day The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of donepezil hydrochloride in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse reactions in patients taking donepezil hydrochloride with or without memantine. Table 6.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). The use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications ( 7.3 ). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists ( 7.4 ). 7.1. Effect of ARICEPT on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of ARICEPT on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether ARICEPT has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of ARICEPT for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of ARICEPT on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of ARICEPT Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. A small effect of CYP2D6 inhibitors was identified in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma donepezil concentrations measured in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil clearance was reduced by approximately 17% in patients taking 10 or 23 mg in combination with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor. This result is consistent with the conclusion that CYP2D6 is a minor metabolic pathway of donepezil. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of ARICEPT. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of ARICEPT is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of ARICEPT are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eisai Inc. at 1-888-274-2378 (fax 1-201-746-3207) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience ARICEPT 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due to adverse events for the ARICEPT 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day ARICEPT 10 mg/day ARICEPT Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of ARICEPT The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by ARICEPT's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued ARICEPT treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received ARICEPT and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with ARICEPT than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving ARICEPT. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to ARICEPT treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due to adverse events for the ARICEPT patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of ARICEPT patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of ARICEPT The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving ARICEPT and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by ARICEPT's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued ARICEPT treatment without the need for dose modification.

ARICEPT 23 mg/day Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease ARICEPT 23 mg/day has been administered to over 1300 individuals globally in clinical trials. Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of ARICEPT 23 mg/day due to adverse events was higher (18.6%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (7.9%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of 23 mg The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of a controlled clinical trial in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 6 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of ARICEPT and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of ARICEPT in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse events in patients taking ARICEPT with or without memantine. Table 6.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia ( 5.1 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block ( 5.2 ). ARICEPT can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases ( 5.3 ). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers ( 5.4 ). The use of ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss ( 5.5 ). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions ( 5.6 ). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions ( 5.7 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease ( 5.8 ). 5.1. Anesthesia ARICEPT, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of ARICEPT. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting ARICEPT, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of ARICEPT, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of ARICEPT in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%) 5.5. Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse event in 4.7% of patients assigned to ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6. Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of ARICEPT, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7. Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8. Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Therefore, alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse reactions. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g., renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions. 7.2 Use of Memantine with Other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Antagonists The combined use of memantine hydrochloride with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution. 7.3 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) and CYP2D6 (e.g., quinidine), inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. Inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil. 7.4 Use of Donepezil with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil hydrochloride, have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.5 Use of Donepezil with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil hydrochloride, are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

Memantine Hydrochloride Memantine hydrochloride extended-release was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 676 patients with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type (341 patients treated with memantine 28 mg/day dose and 335 patients treated with placebo) for a treatment period up to 24 weeks. Of the patients randomized, 236 treated with memantine 28 mg/day and 227 treated with placebo were on a stable dose of donepezil for 3 months prior to screening. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation with Memantine Hydrochloride In the placebo-controlled clinical trial of memantine hydrochloride extended-release, the proportion of patients in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release 28 mg/day dose group and in the placebo group who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 10% and 6%, respectively. The most common adverse reaction in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release treated group that led to treatment discontinuation was dizziness, at a rate of 1.5%. Most Common Adverse Reactions with Memantine Hydrochloride The most common adverse reactions with memantine hydrochloride extended-release in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release group and at a higher frequency than placebo, were headache, diarrhea, and dizziness. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of >= 2% in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release treated group and occurred at a rate greater than placebo.

The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen with placebo, were anorexia (2%), nausea (2%), diarrhea (2%) and urinary tract infection (2%). Most Common Adverse Reactions with Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse reactions reported with donepezil hydrochloride in controlled clinical trials in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the donepezil hydrochloride group and at twice or more the placebo rate, were diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions reported with donepezil hydrochloride in controlled clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease were insomnia, muscle cramp, and fatigue.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7 day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation From Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/% Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% < 1% 3% Vomiting < 1% < 1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30 week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6 week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

ARICEPT has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days. Mild t o Moderate Alzheimer ' s D isease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due to adverse reactions for the ARICEPT 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzhe i mer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day ARICEPT (n=350) % 10 mg/day ARICEPT (n=315) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by ARICEPT's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue, and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued ARICEPT treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15- and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due to adverse reactions for the ARICEPT patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of ARICEPT patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo), and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving ARICEPT and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by ARICEPT's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued ARICEPT treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received ARICEPT 5 mg or 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with ARICEPT than with placebo.

Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of ARICEPT 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Common Adverse Reactions with ARICEPT 23 mg /day The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of ARICEPT and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of ARICEPT in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse reactions in patients taking ARICEPT with or without memantine. Table 6.

This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of ARICEPT. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting ARICEPT, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of ARICEPT, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of ARICEPT in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.7% of patients assigned to ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of ARICEPT, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Con d itions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Con d itions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1. Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). -A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). 7.1. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2. Comparison of Rates of Adverse Events in Mild to Moderate Patients Titrated to 10 mg/day over 1 and 6 Weeks No titration One week titration Six week titration Adverse Event Placebo (n=315) 5 mg/day (n=311) 10 mg/day (n=315) 10 mg/day (n=269) Nausea 6% 5% 19% 6% Diarrhea 5% 8% 15% 9% Insomnia 6% 6% 14% 6% Fatigue 3% 4% 8% 3% Vomiting 3% 3% 8% 5% Muscle cramps 2% 6% 8% 3% Anorexia 2% 3% 7% 3% Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride cholinomimetic effects.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Solco Healthcare US, LLC at 1-866-257-2597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification.

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1 Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 µM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC. at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild To Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day, was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1 . Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg / day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg / day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event / % Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2 .

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3 .

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification.

Approximately 1,200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting 1 to 3 weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1 Effects of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effects of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7 day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7 day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation From Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/% Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% < 1% 3% Vomiting < 1% < 1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30 week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6 week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1 Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 µM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). 7.1. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride cholinomimetic effects.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil HCl due to adverse reactions for the donepezil 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue, and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil HCl treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15- and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil HCl due to adverse reactions for the donepezil HCl patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil HCl patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1 % placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1 % placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo), and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1 % placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil HCl and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil HCl's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil HCl treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil HCl 5 mg or 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil HCl than with placebo.

Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use donepezil HCl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Abdominal pain, agitation, aggression, cholecystitis, confusion, convulsions, hallucinations, heart block (all types), hemolytic anemia, hepatitis, hyponatremia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, pancreatitis, rash, rhabdomyolysis, QTc prolongation, and torsade de pointes."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1) Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2) Cholinesterase inhibitors can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3) Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4) Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.5) Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.6) Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.7) 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil HCl. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil HCl, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil HCl in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.5. Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil HCl, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.6. Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.7. Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Effects of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1,200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15- and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6 week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo), and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia ( 5.1 ) Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block ( 5.2 ) Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases ( 5.3 ) Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers ( 5.4 ) Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions ( 5.6 ) Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions ( 5.7 ) Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1,200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year.

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1. Effect of Donepezil HCl on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil HCl on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 µM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil HCl on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil HCl Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. A small effect of CYP2D6 inhibitors was identified in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma donepezil concentrations measured in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil clearance was reduced by approximately 17% in patients taking 10 mg in combination with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor. This result is consistent with the conclusion that CYP2D6 is a minor metabolic pathway of donepezil. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil HCl treatment without the need for dose modification.

The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil HCl and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil HCl than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil HCl. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil HCl treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil HCl due to adverse events for the donepezil HCl-treated patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil HCl-treated patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil HCl The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil HCl and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil HCl treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil HCl and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil HCl than with placebo.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Cholinesterase inhibitors can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.5). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.6). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.7). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil HCl. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil HCl, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult GI bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil HCl in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or GI bleeding. 5.5 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil HCl, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.6 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.7 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications ( 7.2 ). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists ( 7.3 ). 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7 day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7 day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation From Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/% Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% < 1% 3% Vomiting < 1% < 1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30 week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6 week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia ( 5.1 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block ( 5.2 ). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases ( 5.3 ). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers ( 5.4 ). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions ( 5.6 ). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions ( 5.7 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease ( 5.8 ). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications ( 7.3 ). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists ( 7.4 ). 7.1. Effect of ARICEPT on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of ARICEPT on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether ARICEPT has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of ARICEPT for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of ARICEPT on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of ARICEPT Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. A small effect of CYP2D6 inhibitors was identified in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma donepezil concentrations measured in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil clearance was reduced by approximately 17% in patients taking 10 or 23 mg in combination with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor. This result is consistent with the conclusion that CYP2D6 is a minor metabolic pathway of donepezil. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of ARICEPT. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of ARICEPT is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of ARICEPT are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eisai Inc. at 1-888-274-2378 (fax 1-201-746-3207) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience ARICEPT 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due to adverse events for the ARICEPT 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day ARICEPT 10 mg/day ARICEPT Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of ARICEPT The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by ARICEPT's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued ARICEPT treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received ARICEPT and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with ARICEPT than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving ARICEPT. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to ARICEPT treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due to adverse events for the ARICEPT patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of ARICEPT patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of ARICEPT The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving ARICEPT and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by ARICEPT's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis.

ARICEPT 23 mg/day Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease ARICEPT 23 mg/day has been administered to over 1300 individuals globally in clinical trials. Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of ARICEPT 23 mg/day due to adverse events was higher (18.6%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (7.9%). The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of 23 mg The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5%, include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of a controlled clinical trial in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 6 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients who received 23 mg/day of ARICEPT and at a higher frequency than those receiving 10 mg/day of ARICEPT in a controlled clinical trial that compared the two doses. In this study, there were no important differences in the type of adverse events in patients taking ARICEPT with or without memantine. Table 6.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia ( 5.1 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block ( 5.2 ). ARICEPT can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases ( 5.3 ). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers ( 5.4 ). The use of ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss ( 5.5 ). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions ( 5.6 ). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions ( 5.7 ). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease ( 5.8 ). 5.1. Anesthesia ARICEPT, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of ARICEPT. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting ARICEPT, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of ARICEPT, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of ARICEPT in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%) 5.5. Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse event in 4.7% of patients assigned to ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6. Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of ARICEPT, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7. Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8. Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "Drug Interactions Section Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro . Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "Adverse Reactions Section The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact CARACO Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients.

No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. A small effect of CYP2D6 inhibitors was identified in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma donepezil concentrations measured in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil clearance was reduced by approximately 17% in patients taking 10 mg in combination with a known CYP2D6 inhibitor. This result is consistent with the conclusion that CYP2D6 is a minor metabolic pathway of donepezil. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% < 1% 3% Vomiting < 1% < 1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Clinical Trials in Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease in at Least 2% of Patients Receiving Donepezil Hydrochloride and at a Higher Frequency than Placebo Treated Patients Body System/Adverse Event Placebo (n = 355) Donepezil Hydrochloride (n = 747) Percent of Patients with any Adverse Event 72 74 Body as a Whole Headache 9 10 Pain, various locations 8 9 Accident 6 7 Fatigue 3 5 Cardiovascular System Syncope 1 2 Digestive System Nausea 6 11 Diarrhea 5 10 Vomiting 3 5 Anorexia 2 4 Hemic and Lymphatic System Ecchymosis 3 4 Metabolic and Nutritional Systems Weight Decrease 1 3 Musculoskeletal System Muscle Cramps 2 6 Arthritis 1 2 Nervous System Insomnia 6 9 Dizziness 6 8 Depression < 1 3 Abnormal Dreams 0 3 Somnolence < 1 2 Urogenital System Frequent Urination 1 2 Other Adverse Events Observed During Clinical Trials Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride‘s cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.",

Donepezil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride orally disintegrating tablets 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue, and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15-and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.2). -A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.3). 7.1. Effects of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. 7.2. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.3. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Effects of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean Donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC 0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. 7.2.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. less than 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylchloline- type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1) -Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). -Donepezil hydrochloride tablets can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). -Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). -Cholinomimetics may cause bladder overflow obstructions (5.6). -Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). -Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10mg/day dose than with the 5mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer disease and GI bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5mg/day to 10mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6. Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7. Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8. Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1 Effects of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effects of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis Inc. at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day 10 mg/day Donepezil Donepezil hydrochloride hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2. Comparison of Rates of Adverse Events in Mild to Moderate Patients Titrated to 10 mg/day over 1 and 6 Weeks No titration One week titration Six week titration Adverse Event Placebo 5 mg/day 10 mg/day 10 mg/day (n=315) (n=311) (n=315) (n=269) Nausea 6% 5% 19% 6% Diarrhea 5% 8% 15% 9% Insomnia 6% 6% 14% 6% Fatigue 3% 4% 8% 3% Vomiting 3% 3% 8% 5% Muscle cramps 2% 6% 8% 3% Anorexia 2% 3% 7% 3% Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification.

These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "Warnings And Precautions Section Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride tablets on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride tablets has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride tablets for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride tablets on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride tablets is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo-treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day, was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo-treated patients in the controlled studies.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients and at twice the incidence seen in placebo patients, were anorexia (2% vs 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Clinical Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablet's cholinomimetic effects.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride tablets can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1 Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride tablets on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride tablets have any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride tablets for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride tablets on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride tablets is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-269-544-2299 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg / day Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets 10 mg / day Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event /% Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablet's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States. Body as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent: fever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills, generalized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride Tablets The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablet's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification.

Donepezil hydrochloride tablets has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of Donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride (n=350) % 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride (n=315) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablets cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue, and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15-and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

Approximately 1050 of these patients have been treated for at least three months and more than 950 patients have been treated for at least six months. The range of patient exposure was from 1 to over 500 days. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rate of discontinuation from a controlled clinical trial of donepezil hydrochloride tablets 23 mg/day due to adverse reactions was higher (19%) than for the 10 mg/day treatment group (8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 1% of patients and greater than those occurring with 10 mg/day are shown in Table 5. Table 5.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1) - Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2) - Donepezil hydrochloride tablets can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3) - Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4) - The use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 23 mg once daily is associated with weight loss (5.5) - Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6) - Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7) - Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8) 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the 10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23 mg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10 mg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10 mg/day (11.8% vs. 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs. 2.5%, respectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to vomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group (2.9% vs. 0.4%, respectively). Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical study with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal bleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%). 5.5 Weight Loss Weight loss was reported as an adverse reaction in 4.7% of patients assigned to donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned to 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking 23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of >= 7% by the end of the study, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight loss of >= 7% at the end of the study. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1 Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean K i about 50-130µM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro . Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3 Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4 Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wockhardt USA LLC. at 1-800-346-6854 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Mi ld To Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day, was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/%Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leadin g to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification.

Most Frequent Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation from Controlled Clinical Trials by Dose Group Dose Group Placebo 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride Patients Randomized 355 350 315 Event/% Discontinuing Nausea 1% 1% 3% Diarrhea 0% <1% 3% Vomiting <1% <1% 2% Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2) Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding , especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."

Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1,200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days. Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day, was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation Group in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=355) % 5 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride (n=350) % 10 mg/day Donepezil Hydrochloride (n=315) % Nausea 1 1 3 Diarrhea 0 <1 3 Vomiting <1 <1 2 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving 10 mg/day and twice the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride's cholinomimetic effects. These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications (7.3). A synergistic effect may be expected with concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists (7.4). 7.1. Effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs No in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of donepezil hydrochloride on the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., cisapride, terfenadine) or by CYP2D6 (e.g., imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate of binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50 to 130 μM), that, given the therapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little likelihood of interference. Whether donepezil hydrochloride has any potential for enzyme induction is not known. Formal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of donepezil hydrochloride for interaction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and ketoconazole. No effects of donepezil hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were observed. 7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride Ketoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6, respectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18 healthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil (5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical relevance of this increase in concentration is unknown. Inducers of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil hydrochloride. Formal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of donepezil hydrochloride is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin or cimetidine. 7.3. Use with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.4.

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-ward Pharmaceuticals 1-877-233-2001 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1. Clinical Studies Experience Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse events may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following one and six week titration regimens. Table 2.

In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 3 lists treatment emergent signs and symptoms that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo. In general, adverse events occurred more frequently in female patients and with advancing age. Table 3. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Clinical Trials in Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease in at Least 2% of Patients Receiving Donepezil Hydrochloride and at a Higher Frequency than Placebo Treated Patients Body System/Adverse Event Placebo (n = 355) Donepezil Hydrochloride (n = 747) Percent of Patients with any Adverse Event 72 74 Body as a Whole Headache 9 10 Pain, various locations 8 9 Accident 6 7 Fatigue 3 5 Cardiovascular System Syncope 1 2 Digestive System Nausea 6 11 Diarrhea 5 10 Vomiting 3 5 Anorexia 2 4 Hemic and Lymphatic System Ecchymosis 3 4 Metabolic and Nutritional Systems Weight Decrease 1 3 Musculoskeletal System Muscle Cramps 2 6 Arthritis 1 2 Nervous System Insomnia 6 9 Dizziness 6 8 Depression < 1 3 Abnormal Dreams 0 3 Somnolence < 1 2 Urogenital System Frequent Urination 1 2 Other Adverse Events Observed During Clinical Trials Donepezil hydrochloride has been administered to over 1700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days. Treatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three controlled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were recorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of individuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the proportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event while receiving donepezil hydrochloride. All adverse events occurring at least twice are included, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms too general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events are classified by body system and listed using the following definitions: Frequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; Infrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. These adverse events are not necessarily related to donepezil hydrochloride treatment and in most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events were seen in studies conducted outside the United States.

Severe Alzheimer's Disease Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride due to adverse events for the donepezil hydrochloride patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride‘s cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride treatment without the need for dose modification. Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials Table 4 lists adverse events that were reported in at least 2% of patients in placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride than with placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cholinesterase inhibitors are likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1). Cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2). Donepezil hydrochloride can cause vomiting. Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases (5.3). Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.4). Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.6). Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions (5.7). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease (5.8). 5.1. Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2. Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3. Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.",
