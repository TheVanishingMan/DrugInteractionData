        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) 7.1 Metabolic Drug Interactions Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when Lazanda is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. CYP3A4 inhibitors The concomitant use of Lazanda with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving Lazanda who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors are to be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Increase dose conservatively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. CYP3A4 inducers The concomitant use of Lazanda with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of Lazanda. Patients receiving Lazanda who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers may experience sudden increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and are to be monitored for signs of increased Lazanda activity. Adjust the dose of Lazanda accordingly. 7.2 Non-metabolic Drug Interactions Agents used to treat Allergic Rhinitis The presence of allergic rhinitis is not expected to affect Lazanda absorption. However, co-administration of a vasoconstrictive nasal decongestant such as oxymetazoline to treat allergic rhinitis leads to lower peak plasma concentrations and a delayed Tmax of fentanyl that may cause Lazanda to be less effective in patients with allergic rhinitis who use such decongestants, thus potentially impairing pain management. Additionally, in view of the possibility that the titration of a patient while they are experiencing an acute episode of rhinitis could lead to incorrect dose identification (particularly if they are using a vasoconstrictive decongestant), titration under these circumstances must be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. MAO inhibitor Concomitant use of Lazanda with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuing an MAO inhibitor, is not recommended."

[6.1] To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Archimedes Pharma at 1-866-435-6775 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Lazanda has been evaluated in a total of 523 opioid-tolerant patients with breakthrough cancer pain. The average duration of therapy in patients in the long-term study was 73 days, with 153 patients being treated for over 3 months. Patients continuing into the open-label extension period of the safety study have been treated for up to 26 months. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with Lazanda are typical of opioid side effects, such as nausea, constipation, somnolence, and headache. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The clinical trials of Lazanda were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain; all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone, or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 1 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received Lazanda for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of Lazanda therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse events are included regardless of causality or severity. Table 1 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign Lazanda a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. [5.1] Do not convert patients to Lazanda from other fentanyl products on a mcg per mcg basis, or substitute a Lazanda prescription for another fentanyl product, such substitution may result in fatal overdose. [5.2] Lazanda bottles contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. [5.3, 16.2, 16.3] Use with other CNS depressants and potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. [5.2, 5.4] Titrate Lazanda cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. [5.2, 5.6, 5.7] 5.1 Respiratory Depression Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using Lazanda. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Lazanda and other Fentanyl Products Lazanda is NOT equivalent to other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of Lazanda relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing Lazanda to a patient, DO NOT convert from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to Lazanda from other fentanyl products are not currently available. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl). Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of Lazanda is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] When dispensing Lazanda to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Information for Patients and Their Caregivers Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that Lazanda contains medicine in an amount that could be fatal to a child. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused bottles in their child-resistant container and out of the reach of children at all times. Partially used bottles represent a special risk to children. As soon as they are no longer required, all used, unopened or partially used bottles must be completely emptied of accessible fentanyl solution by spraying the remaining contents into the carbon-lined pouch. The sealed pouch and the empty bottle should be put into the child-resistant container before discarding in the trash. Hands must be washed with soap and water immediately after handling the pouch. [see Storage and Handling (16.2) , Disposal of Lazanda (16.3) , and Patient/Caregiver Instructions (17.1) ]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must question patients and caregivers specifically about the presence of children in the home on a full-time or visiting basis and counsel accordingly regarding the dangers to children of inadvertent exposure to Lazanda. Lazanda could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of Lazanda with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Metabolic Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and may require adjustment of the dose of Lazanda. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking Lazanda of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, cautiously adjust the dose of Lazanda in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of Lazanda may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer Lazanda with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; only use opioids if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Use Lazanda with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors Lazanda is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. [see Non-metabolic Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ], Lazanda is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of Lazanda, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe Lazanda must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive Lazanda, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense Lazanda must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributers that distribute Lazanda must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.tirfremsaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."
