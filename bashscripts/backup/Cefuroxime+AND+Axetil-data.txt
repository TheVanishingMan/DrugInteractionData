        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Cefuroxime Axetil Tablets in Clinical Trials: Multiple-Dose Dosing Regimens: 7 to 10 Days Dosing: Using multiple doses of cefuroxime axetil tablets, 912 patients were treated with cefuroxime axetil (125 to 500 mg twice daily). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity. Twenty (2.2%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to drug toxicity. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 patients who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of cefuroxime axetil tablet-treated patients who discontinued study drug because of adverse events was very similar at daily doses of 1000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events increased with the higher recommended doses. The following adverse events were thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to cefuroxime axetil tablets in multiple-dose clinical trials (n = 912 cefuroxime axetil-treated patients).

No difference in the occurrence of adverse events was found between the 2 regimens. In Clinical Trials for Early Lyme Disease With 20 Days Dosing: Two multicenter trials assessed cefuroxime axetil tablets 500 mg twice a day for 20 days. The most common drug-related adverse experiences were diarrhea (10.6% of patients), Jarisch-Herxheimer's reaction (5.6%), and vaginitis (5.4%). Other adverse experiences occurred with frequencies comparable to those reported with 7 to 10 days dosing. Single-Dose Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonorrhea: In clinical trials using a single dose of cefuroxime axetil tablets, 1061 patients were treated with the recommended dosage of cefuroxime axetil (1000 mg) for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity in these studies.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral Contraceptives: Effects on gut flora may lower estrogen reabsorption and reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. (7.1) Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may lower the bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil tablets. (7.2) Co-administration with probenecid increases systemic exposure to cefuroxime axetil tablets and is therefore not recommended. (7.3) 7.1 Oral Contraceptives Cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. Counsel patients to consider alternate supplementary (non-hormonal) contraceptive measures during treatment. 7.2 Drugs that Reduce Gastric Acidity Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil tablets compared with administration in the fasting state. Administration of drugs that reduce gastric acidity may negate the food effect of increased absorption of cefuroxime axetil tablets when administered in the postprandial state. Administer cefuroxime axetil tablets at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. Histamine-2 (H2) antagonists and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided. 7.3 Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases serum concentrations of cefuroxime [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil is not recommended. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (e.g., Benedict's or Fehling's solution), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria. As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefuroxime axetil. The presence of cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method."

Tablets Multiple-dose Dosing Regimens with 7 to 10 Days' Duration: In multiple-dose clinical trials, 912 subjects were treated with cefuroxime axetil tablets (125 to 500 mg twice daily). It is noted that 125 mg twice daily is not an approved dosage. Twenty (2.2%) subjects discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 subjects who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of subjects treated with cefuroxime axetil tablets who discontinued study drug because of adverse reactions was similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions increased with the higher recommended doses. The adverse reactions in Table 5 are for subjects (n = 912) treated with cefuroxime axetil tablets in multiple-dose clinical trials. Table 5.

Investigations: Positive Coombs' test. 5-Day Regimen: In clinical trials using cefuroxime axetil tablets 250 mg twice daily in the treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis, 399 subjects were treated for 5 days and 402 subjects were treated for 10 days. No difference in the occurrence of adverse reactions was found between the 2 regimens. Early Lyme Disease with 20-Day Regimen: Two multicenter trials assessed cefuroxime axetil tablets 500 mg twice daily for 20 days. The most common drug-related adverse experiences were diarrhea (10.6%), Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (5.6%), and vaginitis (5.4%). Other adverse experiences occurred with frequencies comparable to those reported with 7 to 10 days' dosing. Single-dose Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonorrhea: In clinical trials using a single 1,000-mg dose of cefuroxime axetil tablets, 1,061 subjects were treated for uncomplicated gonorrhea. The adverse reactions in Table 6 were for subjects treated with a single dose of 1,000 mg cefuroxime axetil tablets in US clinical trials. Table 6.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue cefuroxime axetil tablets and institute appropriate therapy. (5.1) Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. (5.2) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime axetil tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime axetil or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. Before initiating therapy with cefuroxime axetil tablets, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue cefuroxime axetil tablets and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil tablets, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefuroxime axetil tablets either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving cefuroxime axetil tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral Contraceptives: Effects on gut flora may lower estrogen reabsorption and reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. (7.1) Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may lower the bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil. (7.2) Co-administration with probenecid increases systemic exposure to cefuroxime axetil and is therefore not recommended. (7.3) 7.1 Oral Contraceptives Cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. Counsel patients to consider alternate supplementary (non-hormonal) contraceptive measures during treatment. 7.2 Drugs that Reduce Gastric Acidity Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil compared with administration in the fasting state. Administration of drugs that reduce gastric acidity may negate the food effect of increased absorption of cefuroxime axetil when administered in the postprandial state. Administer cefuroxime axetil at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. Histamine-2 (H2) antagonists and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided. 7.3 Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases serum concentrations of cefuroxime [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil is not recommended. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (e.g., Benedict's or Fehling's solution), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria. As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefuroxime axetil. The presence of cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method."

(7.1) -Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may lower the bioavailability of CEFTIN. (7.2) -Co-administration with probenecid increases systemic exposure to CEFTIN and is therefore not recommended. (7.3) 7.1 Oral Contraceptives Cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. Counsel patients to consider alternate supplementary (non-hormonal) contraceptive measures during treatment. 7.2 Drugs that Reduce Gastric Acidity Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of CEFTIN compared with administration in the fasting state. Administration of drugs that reduce gastric acidity may negate the food effect of increased absorption of CEFTIN when administered in the postprandial state. Administer CEFTIN at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. Histamine-2 (H2) antagonists and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided. 7.3 Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases serum concentrations of cefuroxime [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil is not recommended. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (e.g., Benedict's or Fehling's solution), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria. As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefuroxime axetil. The presence of cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious and otherwise important adverse reaction is described in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label: Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions [5.1)] The most common adverse reactions (>=3%) for CEFTIN tablets are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction and vaginitis (early Lyme disease). (6.1) The most common adverse reactions (>=2%) for CEFTIN for oral suspension are diarrhea, dislike of taste, diaper rash, and nausea/vomiting. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tablets Multiple-dose Dosing Regimens with 7 to 10 Days' Duration: In multiple-dose clinical trials, 912 subjects were treated with CEFTIN (125 to 500 mg twice daily). It is noted that 125 mg twice daily is not an approved dosage. Twenty (2.2%) subjects discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 subjects who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of subjects treated with CEFTIN who discontinued study drug because of adverse reactions was similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions increased with the higher recommended doses. The adverse reactions in Table 5 are for subjects (n = 912) treated with CEFTIN in multiple-dose clinical trials. Table 5.

No difference in the occurrence of adverse reactions was found between the 2 regimens. Early Lyme Disease with 20-Day Regimen: Two multicenter trials assessed CEFTIN 500 mg twice daily for 20 days. The most common drug-related adverse experiences were diarrhea (10.6%), Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (5.6%), and vaginitis (5.4%). Other adverse experiences occurred with frequencies comparable to those reported with 7 to 10 days' dosing. Single-dose Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonorrhea: In clinical trials using a single 1,000-mg dose of CEFTIN, 1,061 subjects were treated for uncomplicated gonorrhea. The adverse reactions in Table 6 were for subjects treated with a single dose of 1,000 mg CEFTIN in US clinical trials. Table 6.

Oral Suspension In clinical trials using multiple doses of CEFTIN, pediatric subjects (96.7% were younger than 12 years) were treated with CEFTIN (20 to 30 mg/kg/day divided twice daily up to a maximum dose of 500 or 1,000 mg/day, respectively). Eleven (1.2%) US subjects discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. The discontinuations were primarily for gastrointestinal disturbances, usually diarrhea or vomiting. Thirteen (1.4%) US pediatric subjects discontinued therapy due to the taste and/or problems with drug administration. The adverse reactions in Table 7 are for US subjects (n = 931) treated with CEFTIN in multiple-dose clinical trials. Table 7.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue CEFTIN and institute appropriate therapy. (5.1) - Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. (5.2) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. CEFTIN is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to CEFTIN or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. Before initiating therapy with CEFTIN, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue CEFTIN and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including CEFTIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing CEFTIN either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.5 Phenylketonuria CEFTIN for oral suspension 125 mg/5 mL contains phenylalanine 11.8 mg per 5 mL (1 teaspoonful) of reconstituted suspension. CEFTIN for oral suspension 250 mg/5 mL contains phenylalanine 25.2 mg per 5 mL (1 teaspoonful) of reconstituted suspension. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving CEFTIN [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

        "Drug/Drug Interactions Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases the area under the serum concentration versus time curve by 50%. The peak serum cefuroxime concentration after a 1.5-g single dose is greater when taken with 1 g of probenecid (mean = 14.8 mcg/mL) than without probenecid (mean = 12.2 mcg/mL). Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of CEFTIN compared with that of fasting state and tend to cancel the effect of postprandial absorption. In common with other antibiotics, cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS CEFTIN TABLETS IN CLINICAL TRIALS Multiple-Dose Dosing Regimens 7 to 10 Days Dosing Using multiple doses of cefuroxime axetil tablets, 912 patients were treated with cefuroxime axetil (125 to 500 mg twice daily). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity. Twenty (2.2%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to drug toxicity. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 patients who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. (5.1) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. (5.2) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime axetil is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime axetil or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. Before initiating therapy with cefuroxime axetil, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefuroxime axetil either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving cefuroxime axetil [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral Contraceptives: Effects on gut flora may lower estrogen reabsorption and reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. (7.1) Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may lower the bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil tablets. (7.2) Co-administration with probenecid increases systemic exposure to cefuroxime axetil tablets and is therefore not recommended. (7.3) 7.1 Oral Contraceptives Cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. Counsel patients to consider alternate supplementary (non-hormonal) contraceptive measures during treatment. 7.2 Drugs that Reduce Gastric Acidity Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil compared with administration in the fasting state. Administration of drugs that reduce gastric acidity may negate the food effect of increased absorption of cefuroxime axetil when administered in the postprandial state. Administer cefuroxime axetil at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. Histamine-2 (H2) antagonists and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided. 7.3 Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases serum concentrations of cefuroxime [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Co-administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil is not recommended. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (e.g., Benedict's or Fehling's solution), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria. As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefuroxime axetil. The presence of cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method."

Tablets Multiple-dose Dosing Regimens with 7 to 10 Days' Duration: In multiple-dose clinical trials, 912 subjects were treated with cefuroxime axetil (125 to 500 mg twice daily). It is noted that 125 mg twice daily is not an approved dosage. Twenty (2.2%) subjects discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 subjects who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of subjects treated with cefuroxime axetil who discontinued study drug because of adverse reactions was similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions increased with the higher recommended doses. The adverse reactions in Table 5 are for subjects (n = 912) treated with cefuroxime axetil in multiple-dose clinical trials. Table 5.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. (5.1) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. (5.2) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime axetil is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime axetil or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. Before initiating therapy with cefuroxime axetil, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefuroxime axetil either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving cefuroxime axetil [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

        "Drug/Drug Interactions Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases the area under the serum concentration versus time curve by 50%. The peak serum cefuroxime concentration after a 1.5 g single dose is greater when taken with 1 g of probenecid (mean = 14.8 mcg/mL) than without probenecid (mean = 12.2 mcg/mL). Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil compared with that of fasting state and tend to cancel the effect of postprandial absorption. In common with other antibiotics, cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives."

There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity. Twenty (2.2%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to drug toxicity. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 patients who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of cefuroxime axetil tablet-treated patients who discontinued study drug because of adverse events was very similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events increased with the higher recommended doses.

Tablets Multiple-dose Dosing Regimens with 7 to 10 Days' Duration: In multiple-dose clinical trials, 912 subjects were treated with cefuroxime axetil tablets (125 to 500 mg twice daily). It is noted that 125 mg twice daily is not an approved dosage. Twenty (2.2%) subjects discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 subjects who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of subjects treated with cefuroxime axetil tablets who discontinued study drug because of adverse reactions was similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions increased with the higher recommended doses. The adverse reactions in Table 5 are for subjects (n = 912) treated with cefuroxime axetil tablets in multiple-dose clinical trials. Table 5.

Immune System Disorders: Hives, swollen tongue. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Anorexia. Nervous System Disorders: Headache. Cardiac Disorders: Chest pain. Respiratory Disorders: Shortness of breath. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, flatulence, indigestion, mouth ulcers. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash, itch. Renal and Urinary Disorders: Dysuria. Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Vaginitis, vulvar itch. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chills, sleepiness, thirst. Investigations: Positive Coombs' test. 5-Day Regimen: In clinical trials using cefuroxime axetil tablets 250 mg twice daily in the treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis, 399 subjects were treated for 5 days and 402 subjects were treated for 10 days. No difference in the occurrence of adverse reactions was found between the 2 regimens. Early Lyme Disease with 20-Day Regimen: Two multicenter trials assessed cefuroxime axetil tablets 500 mg twice daily for 20 days. The most common drug-related adverse experiences were diarrhea (10.6%), Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (5.6%), and vaginitis (5.4%). Other adverse experiences occurred with frequencies comparable to those reported with 7 to 10 days' dosing. Single-dose Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonorrhea: In clinical trials using a single 1,000-mg dose of cefuroxime axetil tablets, 1,061 subjects were treated for uncomplicated gonorrhea. The adverse reactions in Table 6 were for subjects treated with a single dose of 1,000 mg cefuroxime axetil tablets in US clinical trials. Table 6.

Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Vaginal itch, vaginal discharge. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of cefuroxime axetil tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Gastrointestinal Disorders Pseudomembranous colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatic impairment including hepatitis and cholestasis, jaundice. Immune System Disorders Anaphylaxis, serum sickness-like reaction. Investigations Increased prothrombin time.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue cefuroxime axetil tablets and institute appropriate therapy. (5.1) Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. (5.2) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime axetil tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime axetil or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. Before initiating therapy with cefuroxime axetil tablets, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue cefuroxime axetil tablets and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil tablets, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefuroxime axetil tablets either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving cefuroxime axetil tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS CEFUROXIME AXETIL TABLETS IN CLINICAL TRIALS Multiple-Dose Dosing Regimens 7 to 10 Days Dosing Using multiple doses of cefuroxime axetil tablets, 912 patients were treated with cefuroxime axetil (125 to 500 mg twice daily). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity. Twenty (2.2%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to drug toxicity. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 patients who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of cefuroxime axetil tablet-treated patients who discontinued study drug because of adverse events was very similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events increased with the higher recommended doses.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral Contraceptives: Effects on gut flora may lower estrogen reabsorption and reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. ( 7.1) Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may lower the bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil. ( 7.2) Co-administration with probenecid increases systemic exposure to cefuroxime axetil and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.3) 7.1 Oral Contraceptives Cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. Counsel patients to consider alternate supplementary (non-hormonal) contraceptive measures during treatment. 7.2 Drugs that Reduce Gastric Acidity Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil compared with administration in the fasting state. Administration of drugs that reduce gastric acidity may negate the food effect of increased absorption of cefuroxime axetil when administered in the postprandial state. Administer cefuroxime axetil at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. Histamine-2 (H 2) antagonists and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided. 7.3 Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases serum concentrations of cefuroxime [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil is not recommended. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (e.g., Benedict's or Fehling's solution), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria. As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefuroxime axetil. The presence of cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. ( 5.1) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. ( 5.2) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime axetil is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime axetil or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications (4)] . Before initiating therapy with cefuroxime axetil, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefuroxime axetil either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving cefuroxime axetil [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] ."

        "Drug/Drug Interactions Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases the area under the serum concentration versus time curve by 50%. The peak serum cefuroxime concentration after a 1.5 g single dose is greater when taken with 1 g of probenecid (mean = 14.8 mcg/mL) than without probenecid (mean = 12.2 mcg/mL). Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil compared with that of fasting state and tend to cancel the effect of postprandial absorption. In common with other antibiotics, cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. (5.1) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. (5.2) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime axetil is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime axetil or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. Before initiating therapy with cefuroxime axetil, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin­ producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefuroxime axetil either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving cefuroxime axetil [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. (5.1) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. (5.2) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime axetil is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime axetil or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. Before initiating therapy with cefuroxime axetil, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefuroxime axetil either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving cefuroxime axetil [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

        "Drug/Drug Interactions Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases the area under the serum concentration versus time curve by 50%. The peak serum cefuroxime concentration after a 1.5 g single dose is greater when taken with 1 g of probenecid (mean = 14.8 mcg/mL) than without probenecid (mean = 12.2 mcg/mL). Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil compared with that of fasting state and tend to cancel the effect of postprandial absorption. In common with other antibiotics, cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS CEFUROXIME AXETIL TABLETS IN CLINICAL TRIALS Multiple-Dose Dosing Regimens 7 to 10 Days Dosing Using multiple doses of cefuroxime axetil tablets, 912 patients were treated with cefuroxime axetil (125 to 500 mg twice daily). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity. Twenty (2.2%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to drug toxicity. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 patients who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of cefuroxime axetil tablet-treated patients who discontinued study drug because of adverse events was very similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events increased with the higher recommended doses. The following adverse events were thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to cefuroxime axetil tablets in multiple-dose clinical trials (n = 912 cefuroxime axetil-treated patients).

No difference in the occurrence of adverse events was found between the 2 regimens. In Clinical Trials for Early Lyme Disease With 20 Days Dosing Two multicenter trials assessed cefuroxime axetil tablets 500 mg twice a day for 20 days. The most common drug-related adverse experiences were diarrhea (10.6% of patients), Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (5.6%), and vaginitis (5.4%). Other adverse experiences occurred with frequencies comparable to those reported with 7 to 10 days dosing. Single-Dose Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonorrhea In clinical trials using a single dose of cefuroxime axetil tablets, 1,061 patients were treated with the recommended dosage of cefuroxime axetil (1,000 mg) for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity in these studies. The following adverse events were thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or almost certainly related to cefuroxime axetil in 1,000 mg single-dose clinical trials of cefuroxime axetil tablets in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea conducted in the United States.

Hepatic: Hepatic impairment including hepatitis and cholestasis, jaundice. Neurologic: Seizure. Skin: Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis. Urologic: Renal dysfunction. CEPHALOSPORIN-CLASS ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with cefuroxime axetil, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics: toxic nephropathy, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, increased BUN, increased creatinine, false-positive test for urinary glucose, increased alkaline phosphatase, neutropenia, elevated bilirubin, and agranulocytosis. Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and OVERDOSAGE ). If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated."

(7.1) Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may lower the bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil tablets. (7.2) Co-administration with probenecid increases systemic exposure to cefuroxime axetil tablets and is therefore not recommended. (7.3) 7.1 Oral Contraceptives Cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. Counsel patients to consider alternate supplementary (non-hormonal) contraceptive measures during treatment. 7.2 Drugs that Reduce Gastric Acidity Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil compared with administration in the fasting state. Administration of drugs that reduce gastric acidity may negate the food effect of increased absorption of cefuroxime axetil when administered in the postprandial state. Administer cefuroxime axetil at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. Histamine-2 (H2) antagonists and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided. 7.3 Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases serum concentrations of cefuroxime [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Co-administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil is not recommended. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (e.g., Benedict's or Fehling's solution), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria. As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefuroxime axetil.

Investigations: Positive Coombs' test. 5-Day Regimen: In clinical trials using cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily in the treatment of secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis, 399 subjects were treated for 5 days and 402 subjects were treated for 10 days. No difference in the occurrence of adverse reactions was found between the 2 regimens. Early Lyme Disease with 20-Day Regimen: Two multicenter trials assessed cefuroxime axetil 500 mg twice daily for 20 days. The most common drug-related adverse experiences were diarrhea (10.6%), Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (5.6%), and vaginitis (5.4%). Other adverse experiences occurred with frequencies comparable to those reported with 7 to 10 days' dosing. Single-dose Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonorrhea: In clinical trials using a single 1,000 mg dose of cefuroxime axetil, 1,061 subjects were treated for uncomplicated gonorrhea. The adverse reactions in Table 6 were for subjects treated with a single dose of 1,000 mg cefuroxime axetil in U.S. clinical trials. Table 6.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. (5.1) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. (5.2) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime axetil is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime axetil or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. Before initiating therapy with cefuroxime axetil, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefuroxime axetil either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving cefuroxime axetil [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral Contraceptives: Effects on gut flora may lower estrogen reabsorption and reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. (7.1) Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may lower the bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil. (7.2) Co-administration with probenecid increases systemic exposure to cefuroxime axetil and is therefore not recommended. (7.3) 7.1 Oral Contraceptives Cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. Counsel patients to consider alternate supplementary (non-hormonal) contraceptive measures during treatment. 7.2 Drugs that Reduce Gastric Acidity Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of cefuroxime axetil compared with administration in the fasting state. Administration of drugs that reduce gastric acidity may negate the food effect of increased absorption of cefuroxime axetil when administered in the postprandial state. Administer cefuroxime axetil at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. Histamine-2 (H2) antagonists and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided. 7.3 Probenecid Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases serum concentrations of cefuroxime [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil is not recommended. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (e.g., Benedict's or Fehling's solution), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria. As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefuroxime axetil. The presence of cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious and otherwise important adverse reaction is described in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label: Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] The most common adverse reactions (>=3%) for cefuroxime axetil tablets are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction and vaginitis (early Lyme disease). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tablets Multiple-dose Dosing Regimens with 7 to 10 Days' Duration: In multiple-dose clinical trials, 912 subjects were treated with cefuroxime axetil (125 to 500 mg twice daily). It is noted that 125 mg twice daily is not an approved dosage. Twenty (2.2%) subjects discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 subjects who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of subjects treated with cefuroxime axetil who discontinued study drug because of adverse reactions was similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions increased with the higher recommended doses. The adverse reactions in Table 5 are for subjects (n = 912) treated with cefuroxime axetil in multiple-dose clinical trials. Table 5.
