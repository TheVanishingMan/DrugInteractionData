        "Drug Interactions Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of leflunomide) concentration (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Need for Drug Elimination ). Hepatotoxic Drugs Increased side effects may occur when leflunomide is given concomitantly with hepatotoxic substances. This is also to be considered when leflunomide treatment is followed by such drugs without a drug elimination procedure. In a small (n=30) combination study of leflunomide with methotrexate, a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients. All elevations resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. A >3-fold increase was seen in another 5 patients. All of these also resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. Three patients met "ACR criteria" for liver biopsy (1: Roegnik Grade I, 2: Roegnik Grade IIIa). No pharmacokinetic interaction was identified (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). NSAIDs In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 to 50% in the free fraction of diclofenac and ibuprofen at concentrations in the clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, there was extensive concomitant use of NSAIDs in clinical studies and no differential effect was observed. Tolbutamide In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 to 50% in the free fraction of tolbutamide at concentrations in the clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rifampin Following concomitant administration of a single dose of leflunomide to subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampin, M1 peak levels were increased (~ 40%) over those seen when leflunomide was given alone. Because of the potential for leflunomide levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide and rifampin. Warfarin Increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) when leflunomide and warfarin were co-administered has been rarely reported."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Following oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite, teriflunomide, which is responsible for essentially all of leflunomide???s in vivo activity. Drug interaction studies have been conducted with both leflunomide and with its active metabolite, teriflunomide, where the metabolite was directly administered to the test subjects. Effect of potent CYP and transporter inducers Leflunomide is metabolized by CYP450 metabolizing enzymes. Concomitant use of leflunomide and rifampin, a potent inducer of CYP and transporters, increased the plasma concentration of teriflunomide by 40%. However, when co-administered with the metabolite, teriflunomide, rifampin did not affect its pharmacokinetics. No dosage adjustment is recommended for leflunomide when coadministered with rifampin. Because of the potential for leflunomide concentrations to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide and rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on CYP2C8 substrates Teriflunomide is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, rosiglitazone) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP2C8 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on warfarin Coadministration of leflunomide with warfarin requires close monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) because teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, may decrease peak INR by approximately 25%. Effect on oral contraceptives Teriflunomide may increase the systemic exposures of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Consideration should be given to the type or dose of contraceptives used in combination with leflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. ?? Effect on CYP1A2 substrates Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., alosetron, duloxetine, theophylline, tizanidine) may be reduced. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP1A2 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) substrates Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of OAT3 in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs which are OAT3 substrates (e.g., cefaclor, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ketoprofen, furosemide, methotrexate, zidovudine) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) which are OAT3 substrates as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on BCRP and organic anion transporting polypeptide B1 and B3 (OATP1B1/1B3) substrates Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3 in vivo. For a patient taking leflunomide, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily. For other substrates of BCRP (e.g., mitoxantrone) and drugs in the OATP family (e.g., methotrexate, rifampin), especially HMG-Co reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin, nateglinide, pravastatin, repaglinide, and simvastatin), consider reducing the dose of these drugs and monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposures to the drugs while patients are taking leflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. ???????????????????? Drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 and OAT3 transporters: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may increase exposure of these drugs. (7) ???????????????????? Teriflunomide may increase exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Choose an appropriate oral contraceptive. (7) ???????????????????? Drugs metabolized by CYP1A2: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may decrease exposure of these drugs. (7) ???????????????????? Warfarin: Monitor INR as teriflunomide may decrease INR. (7) ???????????????????? Drugs metabolized by BCRP and OATP1B1/B3 transporters: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may increase exposure of these drugs. (7) ???????????????????? Rosuvastatin: The dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily in patients taking leflunomide. (7)"

In clinical studies (Trials 1, 2, and 3), 1,865 patients were treated with leflunomide administered as either monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 85 years, with an overall median age of 58 years. The mean duration of RA was 6 years ranging from 0 to 45 years. Elevation of Liver Enzymes Treatment with leflunomide was associated with elevations of liver enzymes, primarily ALT and AST, in a significant number of patients; these effects were generally reversible. Most transaminase elevations were mild (??? 2-fold ULN) and usually resolved while continuing treatment. Marked elevations (>3-fold ULN) occurred infrequently and reversed with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. Table 1 shows liver enzyme elevations seen with monthly monitoring in clinical trials Trial 1 and Trial 2. It was notable that the absence of folate use in Trial 3 was associated with a considerably greater incidence of liver enzyme elevation on methotrexate. Table 1.

An increase in ALT greater than or equal to three times the ULN was observed in 3.8% of patients compared to 0.8% in 133 patients continued on methotrexate with placebo. Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions in leflunomide-treated patients with RA include diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), alopecia and rash.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ???????????????????? After stopping leflunomide, it is recommended that an accelerated drug elimination procedure be used to reduce the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, teriflunomide. (5.3) ???????????????????? Severe infections (including sepsis), pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia: Stop leflunomide and use accelerated elimination procedure. Do not start leflunomide in patients with active infection. Monitor CBCs during treatment with leflunomide. (5.4) ???????????????????? Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Stop leflunomide and use accelerated elimination procedure. (5.5) ???????????????????? Peripheral neuropathy: If patient develops symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy, evaluate patient and consider discontinuing leflunomide. (5.7) ???????????????????? Interstitial lung disease: May be fatal. New onset or worsening symptoms may necessitate discontinuation of leflunomide and initiation of accelerated elimination procedure. (5.8) ???????????????????? Increased blood pressure: Monitor and treat. (5.10) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Leflunomide may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Teratogenicity and embryo-lethality occurred in animal reproduction studies with leflunomide at doses lower than the human exposure level [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Leflunomide is contraindicated for use in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4)]. Exclude pregnancy before starting treatment with leflunomide in females of reproductive potential [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during leflunomide treatment and during an accelerated drug elimination procedure after leflunomide treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking leflunomide, stop treatment with leflunomide, apprise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to achieve non-detectable plasma concentrations of teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Upon discontinuing leflunomide, it is recommended that all females of reproductive potential undergo an accelerated drug elimination procedure. Women receiving leflunomide treatment who wish to become pregnant must discontinue leflunomide and undergo an accelerated drug elimination procedure, which includes verification that plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, are less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL). Based on animal data, human plasma concentrations of teriflunomide of less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) are expected to have minimal embryo-fetal risk [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in some patients treated with leflunomide. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than twice the upper limits of normal (>2xULN) before initiating treatment, should not be treated with leflunomide. Use caution when leflunomide is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting leflunomide, and thereafter every 6 to 8 weeks. If ALT elevation > 3 fold ULN occurs, interrupt leflunomide therapy and investigate the cause. If likely leflunomide-induced, perform the accelerated drug elimination procedure and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If leflunomide-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other cause has been found, resumption of leflunomide therapy may be considered. If leflunomide and methotrexate are given concomitantly, follow the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing. 5.3 Procedure for Accelerated Elimination of Leflunomide and its Active Metabolite The active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, is eliminated slowly from the plasma [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure will rapidly reduce plasma concentrations of leflunomide and its active metabolite, teriflunomide. Therefore, an accelerated elimination procedure should be considered at any time after discontinuation of leflunomide, and in particular, when a patient has experienced a severe adverse reaction (e.g., hepatotoxicity, serious infection, bone marrow suppression, Steven Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, peripheral neuropathy, interstitial lung disease), suspected hypersensitivity, or has become pregnant. It is recommended that all women of childbearing potential undergo an accelerated elimination procedure after stopping leflunomide treatment. Without use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure, it may take up to 2 years to reach plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L, the plasma concentration not associated with embryo-fetal toxicity in animals. Elimination can be accelerated by the following procedures: 1)???????????????? Administer cholestyramine 8 grams orally 3 times daily for 11 days. 2)???????????????? Alternatively, administer 50 grams of activated charcoal powder (made into a suspension) orally every 12 hours for 11 days. Verify plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) by two separate tests at least 14 days apart. If plasma teriflunomide concentrations are higher than 0.02 mg/L, repeat cholestyramine and/or activated charcoal treatment. The duration of accelerated drug elimination treatment may be modified based on the clinical status and tolerability of the elimination procedure. The procedure may be repeated as needed, based on teriflunomide concentrations and clinical status. Use of the accelerated drug elimination procedure may potentially result in return of disease activity if the patient had been responding to leflunomide treatment. 5.4 Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Suppression, and Risk of Serious Infections Leflunomide is not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow dysplasia, or severe, uncontrolled infections. If a serious infection occurs, consider interrupting leflunomide therapy and initiating the accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Medications like leflunomide that have immunosuppression potential may cause patients to be more susceptible to infections, including opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis (including extra-pulmonary tuberculosis), and aspergillosis. Severe infections including sepsis, which may be fatal, have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and aspergillosis. Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid illness which, in addition to rheumatoid arthritis, may predispose patients to infection. Cases of tuberculosis were observed in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the metabolite of leflunomide. Prior to initiating leflunomide, all patients should be screened for active and inactive (???latent???) tuberculosis infection as per commonly used diagnostic tests. Leflunomide has not been studied in patients with a positive tuberculosis screen, and the safety of leflunomide in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown. Patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening should be treated by standard medical practice prior to therapy with leflunomide and monitored carefully during leflunomide treatment for possible reactivation of the infection. Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide alone. These events have been reported most frequently in patients who received concomitant treatment with methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, or who had recently discontinued these therapies; in some cases, patients had a prior history of a significant hematologic abnormality. Patients taking leflunomide should have platelet, white blood cell count and hemoglobin or hematocrit monitored at baseline and monthly for six months following initiation of therapy and every 6- to 8 weeks thereafter. If used with concomitant methotrexate and/or other potential immunosuppressive agents, chronic monitoring should be monthly. If evidence of bone marrow suppression occurs in a patient taking leflunomide, stop treatment with leflunomide, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to reduce the plasma concentration of the leflunomide active metabolite, teriflunomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from leflunomide to another anti-rheumatic agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds. 5.5 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, and Drug Reactions with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide. If a patient taking leflunomide develops any of these conditions, stop leflunomide treatment and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.6 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with the use of some immunosuppression medications. There is a potential for immunosuppression with leflunomide. No apparent increase in the incidence of malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders was reported in the clinical trials of leflunomide, but larger dosages and longer-term studies would be needed to determine whether there is an increased risk of malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorders with leflunomide. 5.7 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide and in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide. Most patients recovered after discontinuation of treatment, but some patients had persistent symptoms. Age older than 60 years, concomitant neurotoxic medications, and diabetes may increase the risk for peripheral neuropathy. If a patient taking leflunomide develops a peripheral neuropathy, consider discontinuing leflunomide therapy and performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Dosage and Administration (5.3) ]. 5.8 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease and worsening of pre-existing interstitial lung disease have been reported during treatment with leflunomide and has been associated with fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. The risk of leflunomide-associated interstitial lung disease is increased in patients with a history of interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is a potentially fatal disorder that may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has a variable clinical presentation. New onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, with or without associated fever, may be a reason for discontinuation of leflunomide therapy and for further investigation as appropriate. If discontinuation of leflunomide is necessary, consider performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.9 Vaccinations No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations during leflunomide treatment. Vaccination with live vaccines is, however, not recommended. The long half-life of the active metabolite of leflunomide should be considered when contemplating administration of a live vaccine after stopping leflunomide. 5.10 Blood Pressure Monitoring In placebo-controlled studies with the active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, elevations in blood pressure were observed in some subjects. Blood pressure should be checked before starting treatment with leflunomide and monitored periodically thereafter [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

        "Drug Interactions Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of leflunomide) concentration (see PRECAUTIONS - General - Need for Drug Elimination ). Hepatotoxic Drugs Increased side effects may occur when leflunomide is given concomitantly with hepatotoxic substances. This is also to be considered when leflunomide treatment is followed by such drugs without a drug elimination procedure. In a small (n=30) combination study of leflunomide with methotrexate, a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients. All elevations resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. A >3-fold increase was seen in another 5 patients. All of these also resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. Three patients met \"ACR criteria\" for liver biopsy (1: Roegnik Grade I, 2: Roegnik Grade IIIa). No pharmacokinetic interaction was identified (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). NSAIDs In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 - 50% in the free fraction of diclofenac and ibuprofen at concentrations in the clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, there was extensive concomitant use of NSAIDs in clinical studies and no differential effect was observed. Tolbutamide In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 - 50% in the free fraction of tolbutamide at concentrations in the clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rifampin Following concomitant administration of a single dose of leflunomide to subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampin, M1 peak levels were increased (~40%) over those seen when leflunomide was given alone. Because of the potential for leflunomide levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide and rifampin.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Following oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite, teriflunomide, which is responsible for essentially all of leflunomide's in vivo activity. Drug interaction studies have been conducted with both ARAVA (leflunomide) and with its active metabolite, teriflunomide, where the metabolite was directly administered to the test subjects. Drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 and OAT3 transporters: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may increase exposure of these drugs. (7) Teriflunomide may increase exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Choose an appropriate oral contraceptive. (7) Drugs metabolized by CYP1A2: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may decrease exposure of these drugs. (7) Warfarin: Monitor INR as teriflunomide may decrease INR. (7) Drugs metabolized by BCRP and OATP1B1/B3 transporters: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may increase exposure of these drugs. (7) Rosuvastatin: The dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily in patients taking ARAVA. (7) Effect of potent CYP and transporter inducers Leflunomide is metabolized by CYP450 metabolizing enzymes. Concomitant use of ARAVA and rifampin, a potent inducer of CYP and transporters, increased the plasma concentration of teriflunomide by 40%. However, when co-administered with the metabolite, teriflunomide, rifampin did not affect its pharmacokinetics. No dosage adjustment is recommended for ARAVA when coadministered with rifampin. Because of the potential for ARAVA concentrations to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both ARAVA and rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on CYP2C8 substrates Teriflunomide is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo. In patients taking ARAVA, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, rosiglitazone) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP2C8 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on warfarin Coadministration of ARAVA with warfarin requires close monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) because teriflunomide, the active metabolite of ARAVA, may decrease peak INR by approximately 25%. Effect on oral contraceptives Teriflunomide may increase the systemic exposures of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Consideration should be given to the type or dose of contraceptives used in combination with ARAVA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on CYP1A2 substrates Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of ARAVA, may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. In patients taking ARAVA, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., alosetron, duloxetine, theophylline, tizanidine) may be reduced. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP1A2 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) substrates Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of OAT3 in vivo. In patients taking ARAVA, exposure of drugs which are OAT3 substrates (e.g., cefaclor, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ketoprofen, furosemide, methotrexate, zidovudine) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) which are OAT3 substrates as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on BCRP and organic anion transporting polypeptide B1 and B3 (OATP1B1/1B3) substrates Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3 in vivo. For a patient taking ARAVA, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily. For other substrates of BCRP (e.g., mitoxantrone) and drugs in the OATP family (e.g., methotrexate, rifampin), especially HMG-Co reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin, nateglinide, pravastatin, repaglinide, and simvastatin), consider reducing the dose of these drugs and monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposures to the drugs while patients are taking ARAVA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

In clinical studies (Trials 1, 2, and 3), 1,865 patients were treated with ARAVA administered as either monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 85 years, with an overall median age of 58 years. The mean duration of RA was 6 years ranging from 0 to 45 years. Elevation of Liver Enzymes Treatment with ARAVA was associated with elevations of liver enzymes, primarily ALT and AST, in a significant number of patients; these effects were generally reversible. Most transaminase elevations were mild (<= 2-fold ULN) and usually resolved while continuing treatment. Marked elevations (>3-fold ULN) occurred infrequently and reversed with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. Table 1 shows liver enzyme elevations seen with monthly monitoring in clinical trials Trial 1 and Trial 2. It was notable that the absence of folate use in Trial 3 was associated with a considerably greater incidence of liver enzyme elevation on methotrexate. Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System: agranulocytosis, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia; Infection: opportunistic infections, severe infections including sepsis; Gastrointestinal: acute hepatic necrosis, colitis, including microscopic colitis, hepatitis, jaundice/cholestasis, pancreatitis; severe liver injury such as hepatic failure Immune System: angioedema; Nervous system: peripheral neuropathy; Respiratory: interstitial lung disease, including interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, which may be fatal; pulmonary hypertension; Skin and Appendages: erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis including cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, pustular psoriasis or worsening psoriasis."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS After stopping ARAVA, it is recommended that an accelerated drug elimination procedure be used to reduce the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, teriflunomide. (5.3) Severe infections (including sepsis), pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia: Stop ARAVA and use accelerated elimination procedure. Do not start ARAVA in patients with active infection. Monitor CBCs during treatment with ARAVA. (5.4) Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Stop ARAVA and use accelerated elimination procedure. (5.5) Peripheral neuropathy: If patient develops symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy, evaluate patient and consider discontinuing ARAVA. (5.7) Interstitial lung disease: May be fatal. New onset or worsening symptoms may necessitate discontinuation of Arava and initiation of accelerated elimination procedure. (5.8) Increased blood pressure: Monitor and treat. (5.10) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity ARAVA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Teratogenicity and embryo-lethality occurred in animal reproduction studies with leflunomide at doses lower than the human exposure level [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. ARAVA is contraindicated for use in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4)]. Exclude pregnancy before starting treatment with ARAVA in females of reproductive potential [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during ARAVA treatment and during an accelerated drug elimination procedure after ARAVA treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking ARAVA, stop treatment with ARAVA, apprise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to achieve non-detectable plasma concentrations of teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Upon discontinuing ARAVA, it is recommended that all females of reproductive potential undergo an accelerated drug elimination procedure. Women receiving ARAVA treatment who wish to become pregnant must discontinue ARAVA and undergo an accelerated drug elimination procedure, which includes verification that plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, are less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL). Based on animal data, human plasma concentrations of teriflunomide of less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) are expected to have minimal embryo-fetal risk [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in some patients treated with ARAVA. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than twice the upper limits of normal (>2×ULN) before initiating treatment, should not be treated with ARAVA. Use caution when ARAVA is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting ARAVA, and thereafter every 6-8 weeks. If ALT elevation > 3 fold ULN occurs, interrupt ARAVA therapy and investigate the cause. If likely ARAVA-induced, perform the accelerated drug elimination procedure and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] If ARAVA-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other cause has been found, resumption of ARAVA therapy may be considered. If ARAVA and methotrexate are given concomitantly, follow the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing. 5.3 Procedure for Accelerated Elimination of ARAVA and its Active Metabolite The active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, is eliminated slowly from the plasma [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure will rapidly reduce plasma concentrations of leflunomide and its active metabolite, teriflunomide. Therefore, an accelerated elimination procedure should be considered at any time after discontinuation of ARAVA, and in particular, when a patient has experienced a severe adverse reaction (e.g., hepatotoxicity, serious infection, bone marrow suppression, Steven Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, peripheral neuropathy, interstitial lung disease), suspected hypersensitivity, or has become pregnant. It is recommended that all women of childbearing potential undergo an accelerated elimination procedure after stopping ARAVA treatment. Without use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure, it may take up to 2 years to reach plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L, the plasma concentration not associated with embryo-fetal toxicity in animals. Elimination can be accelerated by the following procedures: 1)Administer cholestyramine 8 grams orally 3 times daily for 11 days. 2)Alternatively, administer 50 grams of activated charcoal powder (made into a suspension) orally every 12 hours for 11 days. Verify plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 µg/mL) by two separate tests at least 14 days apart. If plasma teriflunomide concentrations are higher than 0.02 mg/L, repeat cholestyramine and/or activated charcoal treatment. The duration of accelerated drug elimination treatment may be modified based on the clinical status and tolerability of the elimination procedure. The procedure may be repeated as needed, based on teriflunomide concentrations and clinical status. Use of the accelerated drug elimination procedure may potentially result in return of disease activity if the patient had been responding to ARAVA treatment. 5.4 Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Suppression, and Risk of Serious Infections ARAVA is not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow dysplasia, or severe, uncontrolled infections. If a serious infection occurs, consider interrupting ARAVA therapy and initiating the accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Medications like ARAVA that have immunosuppression potential may cause patients to be more susceptible to infections, including opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis (including extra-pulmonary tuberculosis), and aspergillosis. Severe infections including sepsis, which may be fatal, have been reported in patients receiving ARAVA, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and aspergillosis. Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid illness which, in addition to rheumatoid arthritis, may predispose patients to infection. Cases of tuberculosis were observed in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the metabolite of ARAVA. Prior to initiating ARAVA, all patients should be screened for active and inactive (\"latent\") tuberculosis infection as per commonly used diagnostic tests. ARAVA has not been studied in patients with a positive tuberculosis screen, and the safety of ARAVA in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown. Patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening should be treated by standard medical practice prior to therapy with ARAVA and monitored carefully during ARAVA treatment for possible reactivation of the infection. Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients receiving ARAVA alone. These events have been reported most frequently in patients who received concomitant treatment with methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, or who had recently discontinued these therapies; in some cases, patients had a prior history of a significant hematologic abnormality. Patients taking ARAVA should have platelet, white blood cell count and hemoglobin or hematocrit monitored at baseline and monthly for six months following initiation of therapy and every 6- to 8 weeks thereafter. If used with concomitant methotrexate and/or other potential immunosuppressive agents, chronic monitoring should be monthly. If evidence of bone marrow suppression occurs in a patient taking ARAVA, stop treatment with ARAVA, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to reduce the plasma concentration of the ARAVA active metabolite, teriflunomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from ARAVA to another anti-rheumatic agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds. 5.5 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, and Drug Reactions with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving ARAVA. If a patient taking ARAVA develops any of these conditions, stop ARAVA treatment and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.6 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with the use of some immunosuppression medications. There is a potential for immunosuppression with ARAVA. No apparent increase in the incidence of malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders was reported in the clinical trials of ARAVA, but larger dosages and longer-term studies would be needed to determine whether there is an increased risk of malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorders with ARAVA. 5.7 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients receiving ARAVA and in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide. Most patients recovered after discontinuation of treatment, but some patients had persistent symptoms. Age older than 60 years, concomitant neurotoxic medications, and diabetes may increase the risk for peripheral neuropathy. If a patient taking ARAVA develops a peripheral neuropathy, consider discontinuing ARAVA therapy and performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Dosage and Administration (5.3) ]. 5.8 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease and worsening of pre-existing interstitial lung disease have been reported during treatment with ARAVA and has been associated with fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. The risk of ARAVA-associated interstitial lung disease is increased in patients with a history of interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is a potentially fatal disorder that may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has a variable clinical presentation. New onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, with or without associated fever, may be a reason for discontinuation of ARAVA therapy and for further investigation as appropriate. If discontinuation of ARAVA is necessary, consider performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.9 Vaccinations No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations during ARAVA treatment. Vaccination with live vaccines is, however, not recommended. The long half-life of the active metabolite of ARAVA should be considered when contemplating administration of a live vaccine after stopping ARAVA. 5.10 Blood Pressure Monitoring In placebo-controlled studies with the active metabolite of ARAVA, teriflunomide, elevations in blood pressure were observed in some subjects. Blood pressure should be checked before starting treatment with ARAVA and monitored periodically thereafter [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Following oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite, teriflunomide, which is responsible for essentially all of leflunomide's in vivo activity. Drug interaction studies have been conducted with both leflunomide and with its active metabolite, teriflunomide, where the metabolite was directly administered to the test subjects. Effect of potent CYP and transporter inducers Leflunomide is metabolized by CYP450 metabolizing enzymes. Concomitant use of leflunomide and rifampin, a potent inducer of CYP and transporters, increased the plasma concentration of teriflunomide by 40%. However, when co-administered with the metabolite, teriflunomide, rifampin did not affect its pharmacokinetics. No dosage adjustment is recommended for leflunomide when coadministered with rifampin. Because of the potential for leflunomide concentrations to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide and rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on CYP2C8 substrates Teriflunomide is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, rosiglitazone) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP2C8 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on warfarin Coadministration of leflunomide with warfarin requires close monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) because teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, may decrease peak INR by approximately 25%. Effect on oral contraceptives Teriflunomide may increase the systemic exposures of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Consideration should be given to the type or dose of contraceptives used in combination with leflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on CYP1A2 substrates Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., alosetron, duloxetine, theophylline, tizanidine) may be reduced. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP1A2 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) substrates Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of OAT3 in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs which are OAT3 substrates (e.g., cefaclor, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ketoprofen, furosemide, methotrexate, zidovudine) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) which are OAT3 substrates as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on BCRP and organic anion transporting polypeptide B1 and B3 (OATP1B1/1B3) substrates Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3 in vivo. For a patient taking leflunomide, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily. For other substrates of BCRP (e.g., mitoxantrone) and drugs in the OATP family (e.g., methotrexate, rifampin), especially HMG-Co reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin, nateglinide, pravastatin, repaglinide, and simvastatin), consider reducing the dose of these drugs and monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposures to the drugs while patients are taking leflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. · Drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 and OAT3 transporters: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may increase exposure of these drugs. (7) · Teriflunomide may increase exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Choose an appropriate oral contraceptive. (7) · Drugs metabolized by CYP1A2: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may decrease exposure of these drugs. (7) · Warfarin: Monitor INR as teriflunomide may decrease INR. (7) · Drugs metabolized by BCRP and OATP1B1/B3 transporters: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may increase exposure of these drugs. (7) · Rosuvastatin: The dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily in patients taking leflunomide. (7)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS · After stopping leflunomide, it is recommended that an accelerated drug elimination procedure be used to reduce the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, teriflunomide. (5.3) · Severe infections (including sepsis), pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia: Stop leflunomide and use accelerated elimination procedure. Do not start leflunomide in patients with active infection. Monitor CBCs during treatment with leflunomide. (5.4) · Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Stop leflunomide and use accelerated elimination procedure. (5.5) · Peripheral neuropathy: If patient develops symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy, evaluate patient and consider discontinuing leflunomide. (5.7) · Interstitial lung disease: May be fatal. New onset or worsening symptoms may necessitate discontinuation of leflunomide and initiation of accelerated elimination procedure. (5.8) · Increased blood pressure: Monitor and treat. (5.10) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Leflunomide may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Teratogenicity and embryo-lethality occurred in animal reproduction studies with leflunomide at doses lower than the human exposure level [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Leflunomide is contraindicated for use in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4)]. Exclude pregnancy before starting treatment with leflunomide in females of reproductive potential [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during leflunomide treatment and during an accelerated drug elimination procedure after leflunomide treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking leflunomide, stop treatment with leflunomide, apprise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to achieve non-detectable plasma concentrations of teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Upon discontinuing leflunomide, it is recommended that all females of reproductive potential undergo an accelerated drug elimination procedure. Women receiving leflunomide treatment who wish to become pregnant must discontinue leflunomide and undergo an accelerated drug elimination procedure, which includes verification that plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, are less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL). Based on animal data, human plasma concentrations of teriflunomide of less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) are expected to have minimal embryo-fetal risk [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in some patients treated with leflunomide. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than twice the upper limits of normal (>2xULN) before initiating treatment, should not be treated with leflunomide. Use caution when leflunomide is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting leflunomide, and thereafter every 6 to 8 weeks. If ALT elevation > 3 fold ULN occurs, interrupt leflunomide therapy and investigate the cause. If likely leflunomide-induced, perform the accelerated drug elimination procedure and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If leflunomide-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other cause has been found, resumption of leflunomide therapy may be considered. If leflunomide and methotrexate are given concomitantly, follow the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing. 5.3 Procedure for Accelerated Elimination of Leflunomide and its Active Metabolite The active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, is eliminated slowly from the plasma [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure will rapidly reduce plasma concentrations of leflunomide and its active metabolite, teriflunomide. Therefore, an accelerated elimination procedure should be considered at any time after discontinuation of leflunomide, and in particular, when a patient has experienced a severe adverse reaction (e.g., hepatotoxicity, serious infection, bone marrow suppression, Steven Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, peripheral neuropathy, interstitial lung disease), suspected hypersensitivity, or has become pregnant. It is recommended that all women of childbearing potential undergo an accelerated elimination procedure after stopping leflunomide treatment. Without use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure, it may take up to 2 years to reach plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L, the plasma concentration not associated with embryo-fetal toxicity in animals. Elimination can be accelerated by the following procedures: 1) Administer cholestyramine 8 grams orally 3 times daily for 11 days. 2) Alternatively, administer 50 grams of activated charcoal powder (made into a suspension) orally every 12 hours for 11 days. Verify plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) by two separate tests at least 14 days apart. If plasma teriflunomide concentrations are higher than 0.02 mg/L, repeat cholestyramine and/or activated charcoal treatment. The duration of accelerated drug elimination treatment may be modified based on the clinical status and tolerability of the elimination procedure. The procedure may be repeated as needed, based on teriflunomide concentrations and clinical status. Use of the accelerated drug elimination procedure may potentially result in return of disease activity if the patient had been responding to leflunomide treatment. 5.4 Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Suppression, and Risk of Serious Infections Leflunomide is not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow dysplasia, or severe, uncontrolled infections. If a serious infection occurs, consider interrupting leflunomide therapy and initiating the accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Medications like leflunomide that have immunosuppression potential may cause patients to be more susceptible to infections, including opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis (including extra-pulmonary tuberculosis), and aspergillosis. Severe infections including sepsis, which may be fatal, have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and aspergillosis. Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid illness which, in addition to rheumatoid arthritis, may predispose patients to infection. Cases of tuberculosis were observed in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the metabolite of leflunomide. Prior to initiating leflunomide, all patients should be screened for active and inactive ("latent") tuberculosis infection as per commonly used diagnostic tests. Leflunomide has not been studied in patients with a positive tuberculosis screen, and the safety of leflunomide in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown. Patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening should be treated by standard medical practice prior to therapy with leflunomide and monitored carefully during leflunomide treatment for possible reactivation of the infection. Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide alone. These events have been reported most frequently in patients who received concomitant treatment with methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, or who had recently discontinued these therapies; in some cases, patients had a prior history of a significant hematologic abnormality. Patients taking leflunomide should have platelet, white blood cell count and hemoglobin or hematocrit monitored at baseline and monthly for six months following initiation of therapy and every 6- to 8 weeks thereafter. If used with concomitant methotrexate and/or other potential immunosuppressive agents, chronic monitoring should be monthly. If evidence of bone marrow suppression occurs in a patient taking leflunomide, stop treatment with leflunomide, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to reduce the plasma concentration of the leflunomide active metabolite, teriflunomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from leflunomide to another anti-rheumatic agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds. 5.5 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, and Drug Reactions with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide. If a patient taking leflunomide develops any of these conditions, stop leflunomide treatment and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.6 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with the use of some immunosuppression medications. There is a potential for immunosuppression with leflunomide. No apparent increase in the incidence of malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders was reported in the clinical trials of leflunomide, but larger dosages and longer-term studies would be needed to determine whether there is an increased risk of malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorders with leflunomide. 5.7 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide and in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide. Most patients recovered after discontinuation of treatment, but some patients had persistent symptoms. Age older than 60 years, concomitant neurotoxic medications, and diabetes may increase the risk for peripheral neuropathy. If a patient taking leflunomide develops a peripheral neuropathy, consider discontinuing leflunomide therapy and performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Dosage and Administration (5.3) ]. 5.8 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease and worsening of pre-existing interstitial lung disease have been reported during treatment with leflunomide and has been associated with fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. The risk of leflunomide-associated interstitial lung disease is increased in patients with a history of interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is a potentially fatal disorder that may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has a variable clinical presentation. New onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, with or without associated fever, may be a reason for discontinuation of leflunomide therapy and for further investigation as appropriate. If discontinuation of leflunomide is necessary, consider performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.9 Vaccinations No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations during leflunomide treatment. Vaccination with live vaccines is, however, not recommended. The long half-life of the active metabolite of leflunomide should be considered when contemplating administration of a live vaccine after stopping leflunomide. 5.10 Blood Pressure Monitoring In placebo-controlled studies with the active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, elevations in blood pressure were observed in some subjects. Blood pressure should be checked before starting treatment with leflunomide and monitored periodically thereafter [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Following oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite, teriflunomide, which is responsible for essentially all of leflunomide's in vivo activity. Drug interaction studies have been conducted with both leflunomide and with its active metabolite, teriflunomide, where the metabolite was directly administered to the test subjects. Effect of potent CYP and transporter inducers Leflunomide is metabolized by CYP450 metabolizing enzymes. Concomitant use of leflunomide and rifampin, a potent inducer of CYP and transporters, increased the plasma concentration of teriflunomide by 40%. However, when co-administered with the metabolite, teriflunomide, rifampin did not affect its pharmacokinetics. No dosage adjustment is recommended for leflunomide when coadministered with rifampin. Because of the potential for leflunomide concentrations to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide and rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Effect on CYP2C8 substrates Teriflunomide is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo . In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, rosiglitazone) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP2C8 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Effect on warfarin Coadministration of leflunomide with warfarin requires close monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) because teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, may decrease peak INR by approximately 25%. Effect on oral contraceptives Teriflunomide may increase the systemic exposures of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Consideration should be given to the type or dose of contraceptives used in combination with leflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Effect on CYP1A2 substrates Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo . In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., alosetron, duloxetine, theophylline, tizanidine) may be reduced. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP1A2 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Effect on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) substrates Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of OAT3 in vivo . In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs which are OAT3 substrates (e.g., cefaclor, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ketoprofen, furosemide, methotrexate, zidovudine) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) which are OAT3 substrates as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Effect on BCRP and organic anion transporting polypeptide B1 and B3 (OATP1B1/1B3) substrates Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3 in vivo . For a patient taking leflunomide, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily. For other substrates of BCRP (e.g., mitoxantrone) and drugs in the OATP family (e.g., methotrexate, rifampin), especially HMG-Co reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin, nateglinide, pravastatin, repaglinide, and simvastatin), consider reducing the dose of these drugs and monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposures to the drugs while patients are taking leflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 and OAT3 transporters: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may increase exposure of these drugs. ( 7 ) Teriflunomide may increase exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Choose an appropriate oral contraceptive. ( 7 ) Drugs metabolized by CYP1A2: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may decrease exposure of these drugs. ( 7 ) Warfarin: Monitor INR as teriflunomide may decrease INR. ( 7 ) Drugs metabolized by BCRP and OATP1B1/B3 transporters: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may increase exposure of these drugs. ( 7 ) Rosuvastatin: The dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily in patients taking leflunomide. ( 7 )"

In clinical studies (Trials 1, 2, and 3), 1,865 patients were treated with leflunomide administered as either monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 85 years, with an overall median age of 58 years. The mean duration of RA was 6 years ranging from 0 to 45 years. Elevation of Liver Enzymes Treatment with leflunomide was associated with elevations of liver enzymes, primarily ALT and AST, in a significant number of patients; these effects were generally reversible. Most transaminase elevations were mild (<= 2-fold ULN) and usually resolved while continuing treatment. Marked elevations (>3-fold ULN) occurred infrequently and reversed with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. Table 1 shows liver enzyme elevations seen with monthly monitoring in clinical trials Trial 1 and Trial 2. It was notable that the absence of folate use in Trial 3 was associated with a considerably greater incidence of liver enzyme elevation on methotrexate. Table 1.

An increase in ALT greater than or equal to three times the ULN was observed in 3.8% of patients compared to 0.8% in 133 patients continued on methotrexate with placebo. Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions in leflunomide -treated patients with RA include diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), alopecia and rash.

Based on animal data, human plasma concentrations of teriflunomide of less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) are expected to have minimal embryo-fetal risk [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2Hepatotoxicity Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in some patients treated with leflunomide. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than twice the upper limits of normal (>2xULN) before initiating treatment, should not be treated with leflunomide. Use caution when leflunomide is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting leflunomide, and thereafter every 6 to 8 weeks. If ALT elevation > 3 fold ULN occurs, interrupt leflunomide therapy and investigate the cause. If likely leflunomide - induced, perform the accelerated drug elimination procedure and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] If leflunomide -induced liver injury is unlikely because some other cause has been found, resumption of leflunomide therapy may be considered. If leflunomide and methotrexate are given concomitantly, follow the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing. 5.3Procedure for Accelerated Elimination of leflunomide and its Active Metabolite The active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, is eliminated slowly from the plasma [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure will rapidly reduce plasma concentrations of leflunomide and its active metabolite, teriflunomide. Therefore, an accelerated elimination procedure should be considered at any time after discontinuation of leflunomide, and in particular, when a patient has experienced a severe adverse reaction (e.g., hepatotoxicity, serious infection, bone marrow suppression, Steven Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, peripheral neuropathy, interstitial lung disease), suspected hypersensitivity, or has become pregnant. It is recommended that all women of childbearing potential undergo an accelerated elimination procedure after stopping leflunomide treatment. Without use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure, it may take up to 2 years to reach plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L, the plasma concentration not associated with embryo-fetal toxicity in animals. Elimination can be accelerated by the following procedures: 1)Administer cholestyramine 8 grams orally 3 times daily for 11 days. 2)Alternatively, administer 50 grams of activated charcoal powder (made into a suspension) orally every 12 hours for 11 days. Verify plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 µg/mL) by two separate tests at least 14 days apart. If plasma teriflunomide concentrations are higher than 0.02 mg/L, repeat cholestyramine and/or activated charcoal treatment. The duration of accelerated drug elimination treatment may be modified based on the clinical status and tolerability of the elimination procedure. The procedure may be repeated as needed, based on teriflunomide concentrations and clinical status. Use of the accelerated drug elimination procedure may potentially result in return of disease activity if the patient had been responding to leflunomide treatment. 5.4Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Suppression, and Risk of Serious Infections Leflunomide is not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow dysplasia, or severe, uncontrolled infections. If a serious infection occurs, consider interrupting leflunomide therapy and initiating the accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Medications like leflunomide that have immunosuppression potential may cause patients to be more susceptible to infections, including opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis (including extra-pulmonary tuberculosis), and aspergillosis. Severe infections including sepsis, which may be fatal, have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and aspergillosis. Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid illness which, in addition to rheumatoid arthritis, may predispose patients to infection. Cases of tuberculosis were observed in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the metabolite of leflunomide. Prior to initiating leflunomide, all patients should be screened for active and inactive (\"latent\") tuberculosis infection as per commonly used diagnostic tests. Leflunomide has not been studied in patients with a positive tuberculosis screen, and the safety of leflunomide in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown. Patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening should be treated by standard medical practice prior to therapy with leflunomide and monitored carefully during leflunomide treatment for possible reactivation of the infection. Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide alone. These events have been reported most frequently in patients who received concomitant treatment with methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, or who had recently discontinued these therapies; in some cases, patients had a prior history of a significant hematologic abnormality. Patients taking leflunomide should have platelet, white blood cell count and hemoglobin or hematocrit monitored at baseline and monthly for six months following initiation of therapy and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. If used with concomitant methotrexate and/or other potential immunosuppressive agents, chronic monitoring should be monthly. If evidence of bone marrow suppression occurs in a patient taking leflunomide, stop treatment with leflunomide, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to reduce the plasma concentration of the leflunomide active metabolite, teriflunomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from leflunomide to another anti-rheumatic agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds. 5.5Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, and Drug Reactions with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide. If a patient taking leflunomide develops any of these conditions, stop leflunomide treatment and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.6Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with the use of some immunosuppression medications. There is a potential for immunosuppression with leflunomide. No apparent increase in the incidence of malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders was reported in the clinical trials of leflunomide, but larger dosages and longer-term studies would be needed to determine whether there is an increased risk of malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorders with leflunomide. 5.7Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide and in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide. Most patients recovered after discontinuation of treatment, but some patients had persistent symptoms. Age older than 60 years, concomitant neurotoxic medications, and diabetes may increase the risk for peripheral neuropathy. If a patient taking leflunomide develops a peripheral neuropathy, consider discontinuing leflunomide therapy and performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Dosage and Administration (5.3) ]. 5.8Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease and worsening of pre-existing interstitial lung disease have been reported during treatment with leflunomide and has been associated with fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. The risk of leflunomide -associated interstitial lung disease is increased in patients with a history of interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is a potentially fatal disorder that may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has a variable clinical presentation. New onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, with or without associated fever, may be a reason for discontinuation of leflunomide therapy and for further investigation as appropriate. If discontinuation of leflunomide is necessary, consider performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 5.9Vaccinations No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations during leflunomide treatment. Vaccination with live vaccines is, however, not recommended. The long half-life of the active metabolite of leflunomide should be considered when contemplating administration of a live vaccine after stopping leflunomide. 5.10Blood Pressure Monitoring In placebo-controlled studies with the active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, elevations in blood pressure were observed in some subjects. Blood pressure should be checked before starting treatment with leflunomide and monitored periodically thereafter [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]."

        "Drug Interactions Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of leflunomide) concentration (see PRECAUTIONS-General- Need for Drug Elimination ). Hepatotoxic Drugs Increased side effects may occur when leflunomide is given concomitantly with hepatotoxic substances. This is also to be considered when leflunomide treatment is followed by such drugs without a drug elimination procedure. In a small (n=30) combination study of leflunomide with methotrexate, a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients. All elevations resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. A >3-fold increase was seen in another 5 patients. All of these also resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. Three patients met \"ACR criteria\" for liver biopsy (1: Roegnik Grade I, 2: Roegnik Grade IIIa). No pharmacokinetic interaction was identified (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). NSAIDs In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 to 50% in the free fraction of diclofenac and ibuprofen at concentrations in the clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, there was extensive concomitant use of NSAIDs in clinical studies and no differential effect was observed. Tolbutamide In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 to 50% in the free fraction of tolbutamide at concentrations in the clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rifampin Following concomitant administration of a single dose of leflunomide to subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampin, M1 peak levels were increased (~40%) over those seen when leflunomide was given alone. Because of the potential for leflunomide levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide and rifampin. Warfarin Increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) when leflunomide and warfarin were coadministered has been rarely reported."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Following oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite, teriflunomide, which is responsible for essentially all of leflunomide's in vivo activity. Drug interaction studies have been conducted with both leflunomide and with its active metabolite, teriflunomide, where the metabolite was directly administered to the test subjects. Effect of potent CYP and transporter inducers Leflunomide is metabolized by CYP450 metabolizing enzymes. Concomitant use of leflunomide and rifampin, a potent inducer of CYP and transporters, increased the plasma concentration of teriflunomide by 40%. However, when co-administered with the metabolite, teriflunomide, rifampin did not affect its pharmacokinetics. No dosage adjustment is recommended for leflunomide when co-administered with rifampin. Because of the potential for leflunomide concentrations to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide and rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on CYP2C8 substrates Teriflunomide is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, rosiglitazone) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP2C8 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on warfarin Co-administration of leflunomide with warfarin requires close monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) because teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, may decrease peak INR by approximately 25%. Effect on oral contraceptives Teriflunomide may increase the systemic exposures of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Consideration should be given to the type or dose of contraceptives used in combination with leflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on CYP1A2 substrates Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., alosetron, duloxetine, theophylline, tizanidine) may be reduced. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP1A2 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) substrates Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of OAT3 in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs which are OAT3 substrates (e.g., cefaclor, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ketoprofen, furosemide, methotrexate, zidovudine) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) which are OAT3 substrates as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Effect on BCRP and organic anion transporting polypeptide B1 and B3 (OATP1B1/1B3) substrates Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3 in vivo. For a patient taking leflunomide, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily. For other substrates of BCRP (e.g., mitoxantrone) and drugs in the OATP family (e.g., methotrexate, rifampin), especially HMG- Co reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin, nateglinide, pravastatin, repaglinide, and simvastatin), consider reducing the dose of these drugs and monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposures to the drugs while patients are taking leflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 and OAT3 transporters: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may increase exposure of these drugs. (7) Teriflunomide may increase exposure of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Choose an appropriate oral contraceptive. (7) Drugs metabolized by CYP1A2: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may decrease exposure of these drugs. (7) Warfarin: Monitor INR as teriflunomide may decrease INR. (7) Drugs metabolized by BCRP and OATP1B1/B3 transporters: Monitor patients because teriflunomide may increase exposure of these drugs. (7) Rosuvastatin: The dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily in patients taking leflunomide. (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Bone marrow suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Interstitial lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>=10%) regardless of relation to leflunomide treatment were diarrhea, respiratory infection, nausea, headache, rash, abnormal liver enzymes, dyspepsia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical studies (Trials 1, 2, and 3), 1,865 patients were treated with leflunomide administered as either monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 85 years, with an overall median age of 58 years. The mean duration of RA was 6 years ranging from 0 to 45 years. Elevation of Liver Enzymes Treatment with leflunomide was associated with elevations of liver enzymes, primarily ALT and AST, in a significant number of patients; these effects were generally reversible. Most transaminase elevations were mild (<= 2-fold ULN) and usually resolved while continuing treatment. Marked elevations (>3-fold ULN) occurred infrequently and reversed with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. Table 1 shows liver enzyme elevations seen with monthly monitoring in clinical trials Trial 1 and Trial 2. It was notable that the absence of folate use in Trial 3 was associated with a considerably greater incidence of liver enzyme elevation on methotrexate. Table 1. Liver Enzyme Elevations >3-fold Upper Limits of Normal (ULN) in Patients with RA in Trials 1, 2, and 3** Trial 1 Trial 2 Trial 3* Leflunomide 20 mg/day (n= 182) PL(n=118) MTX 7.5 - 15 mg/wk (n=182) Leflunomide 20mg/day (n=133) PL(n=92) SSZ 2.0 g/day (n=133) Leflunomide 20 mg/day (n=501) MTX 7.5 - 15 mg/wk (n=498) ALT (SGPT)>3-fold ULN (n%) Reversed to <= 2­ fold ULN: 8(4.4) 8 3(2.5) 3 5(2.7) 5 2(1.5) 2 1(1.1) 1 2(1.5) 2 13(2.6) 12 83 (16.7) 82 Timing of Elevation 6 1 1 2 1 2 7 27 0-3 Months 4-6 Months 1 1 3 - - - 1 34 7-9 Months 1 1 1 - - - - 16 10-12 Months - - - - - - 5 6 MTX = methotrexate, PL = placebo, SSZ = sulfasalazine, ULN = Upper limit of normal *Only 10% of patients in Trial 3 received folate. All patients in Trial 1 received folate. In a 6 month study of 263 patients with persistent active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy, and with normal LFTs, leflunomide was administered to a group of 130 patients starting at 10 mg per day and increased to 20 mg as needed. An increase in ALT greater than or equal to three times the ULN was observed in 3.8% of patients compared to 0.8% in 133 patients continued on methotrexate with placebo. Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions in leflunomide-treated patients with RA include diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), alopecia and rash.

Less Common Adverse Reactions In addition, in controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events in the leflunomide treatment group occurred at a higher incidence than in the placebo group. These adverse events were deemed possibly related to the study drug. Blood and Lymphatic System: leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia; Cardiovascular: chest pain, palpitation, thrombophlebitis of the leg, varicose vein; Eye: blurred vision, eye disorder, papilledema, retinal disorder, retinal hemorrhage; Gastrointestinal: alkaline phosphatase increased, anorexia, bilirubinemia, flatulence, gamma-GT increased, salivary gland enlarged, sore throat, vomiting, dry mouth; General Disorders: malaise; Immune System: anaphylactic reaction; Infection: abscess, flu syndrome, vaginal moniliasis; Nervous System: dizziness, headache, somnolence; Respiratory System: dyspnea; 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of leflunomide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System: agranulocytosis, leucopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia; Infection: opportunistic infections, severe infections including sepsis; Gastrointestinal: acute hepatic necrosis, hepatitis, jaundice/cholestasis, pancreatitis; severe liver injury such as hepatic failure Immune System: angioedema; Nervous system: peripheral neuropathy; Respiratory: interstitial lung disease, including interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, which may be fatal; Skin and Appendages: erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis including cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, pustular psoriasis or worsening psoriasis."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS After stopping leflunomide, it is recommended that an accelerated drug elimination procedure be used to reduce the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, teriflunomide. (5.3) Severe infections (including sepsis), pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia: Stop leflunomide and use accelerated elimination procedure. Do not start leflunomide in patients with active infection. Monitor CBCs during treatment with leflunomide. (5.4) Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Stop leflunomide and use accelerated elimination procedure. (5.5) Peripheral neuropathy: If patient develops symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy, evaluate patient and consider discontinuing leflunomide. (5.7) Interstitial lung disease: May be fatal. New onset or worsening symptoms may necessitate discontinuation of leflunomide and initiation of accelerated elimination procedure. (5.8) Increased blood pressure: Monitor and treat. (5.10) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Leflunomide may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Teratogenicity and embryo-lethality occurred in animal reproduction studies with leflunomide at doses lower than the human exposure level [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Leflunomide is contraindicated for use in pregnant women [see Contraindications (4)]. Exclude pregnancy before starting treatment with leflunomide in females of reproductive potential [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during leflunomide treatment and during an accelerated drug elimination procedure after leflunomide treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking leflunomide, stop treatment with leflunomide, apprise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to achieve non-detectable plasma concentrations of teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Upon discontinuing leflunomide, it is recommended that all females of reproductive potential undergo an accelerated drug elimination procedure. Women receiving leflunomide treatment who wish to become pregnant must discontinue leflunomide and undergo an accelerated drug elimination procedure, which includes verification that plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, are less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL). Based on animal data, human plasma concentrations of teriflunomide of less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) are expected to have minimal embryo-fetal risk [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in some patients treated with leflunomide. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than twice the upper limits of normal (>2xULN) before initiating treatment, should not be treated with leflunomide. Use caution when leflunomide is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting leflunomide, and thereafter every 6-8 weeks. If ALT elevation > 3 fold ULN occurs, interrupt leflunomide therapy and investigate the cause. If likely leflunomide- induced, perform the accelerated drug elimination procedure and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If leflunomide-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other cause has been found, resumption of leflunomide therapy may be considered. If leflunomide and methotrexate are given concomitantly, follow the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing. 5.3 Procedure for Accelerated Elimination of Leflunomide and its Active Metabolite The active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, is eliminated slowly from the plasma [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure will rapidly reduce plasma concentrations of leflunomide and its active metabolite, teriflunomide. Therefore, an accelerated elimination procedure should be considered at any time after discontinuation of leflunomide, and in particular, when a patient has experienced a severe adverse reaction (e.g., hepatotoxicity, serious infection, bone marrow suppression, Steven Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, peripheral neuropathy, interstitial lung disease), suspected hypersensitivity, or has become pregnant. It is recommended that all women of childbearing potential undergo an accelerated elimination procedure after stopping leflunomide treatment. Without use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure, it may take up to 2 years to reach plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L, the plasma concentration not associated with embryo-fetal toxicity in animals. Elimination can be accelerated by the following procedures: 1) Administer cholestyramine 8 grams orally 3 times daily for 11 days. 2) Alternatively, administer 50 grams of activated charcoal powder (made into a suspension) orally every 12 hours for 11 days. Verify plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 µg/mL) by two separate tests at least 14 days apart. If plasma teriflunomide concentrations are higher than 0.02 mg/L, repeat cholestyramine and/or activated charcoal treatment. The duration of accelerated drug elimination treatment may be modified based on the clinical status and tolerability of the elimination procedure. The procedure may be repeated as needed, based on teriflunomide concentrations and clinical status. Use of the accelerated drug elimination procedure may potentially result in return of disease activity if the patient had been responding to leflunomide treatment. 5.4 Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Suppression, and Risk of Serious Infections Leflunomide is not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow dysplasia, or severe, uncontrolled infections. If a serious infection occurs, consider interrupting leflunomide therapy and initiating the accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Medications like leflunomide that have immunosuppression potential may cause patients to be more susceptible to infections, including opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis (including extra-pulmonary tuberculosis), and aspergillosis. Severe infections including sepsis, which may be fatal, have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and aspergillosis. Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid illness which, in addition to rheumatoid arthritis, may predispose patients to infection. Cases of tuberculosis were observed in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the metabolite of leflunomide. Prior to initiating leflunomide, all patients should be screened for active and inactive (\"latent\") tuberculosis infection as per commonly used diagnostic tests. Leflunomide has not been studied in patients with a positive tuberculosis screen, and the safety of leflunomide in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown. Patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening should be treated by standard medical practice prior to therapy with leflunomide and monitored carefully during leflunomide treatment for possible reactivation of the infection. Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide alone. These events have been reported most frequently in patients who received concomitant treatment with methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, or who had recently discontinued these therapies; in some cases, patients had a prior history of a significant hematologic abnormality. Patients taking leflunomide should have platelet, white blood cell count and hemoglobin or hematocrit monitored at baseline and monthly for six months following initiation of therapy and every 6- to 8 weeks thereafter. If used with concomitant methotrexate and/or other potential immunosuppressive agents, chronic monitoring should be monthly. If evidence of bone marrow suppression occurs in a patient taking leflunomide, stop treatment with leflunomide, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to reduce the plasma concentration of the leflunomide active metabolite, teriflunomide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from leflunomide to another anti-rheumatic agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds. 5.5 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, and Drug Reactions with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide. If a patient taking leflunomide develops any of these conditions, stop leflunomide treatment and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.6 Malignancy The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with the use of some immunosuppression medications. There is a potential for immunosuppression with leflunomide. No apparent increase in the incidence of malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders was reported in the clinical trials of leflunomide, but larger dosages and longer-term studies would be needed to determine whether there is an increased risk of malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorders with leflunomide. 5.7 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients receiving leflunomide and in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide. Most patients recovered after discontinuation of treatment, but some patients had persistent symptoms. Age older than 60 years, concomitant neurotoxic medications, and diabetes may increase the risk for peripheral neuropathy. If a patient taking leflunomide develops a peripheral neuropathy, consider discontinuing leflunomide therapy and performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Dosage and Administration (5.3)]. 5.8 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease and worsening of pre-existing interstitial lung disease have been reported during treatment with leflunomide and has been associated with fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The risk of leflunomide-associated interstitial lung disease is increased in patients with a history of interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease is a potentially fatal disorder that may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has a variable clinical presentation. New onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, with or without associated fever, may be a reason for discontinuation of leflunomide therapy and for further investigation as appropriate. If discontinuation of leflunomide is necessary, consider performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.9 Vaccinations No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations during leflunomide treatment. Vaccination with live vaccines is, however, not recommended. The long half-life of the active metabolite of leflunomide should be considered when contemplating administration of a live vaccine after stopping leflunomide. 5.10 Blood Pressure Monitoring In placebo-controlled studies with the active metabolite of leflunomide, teriflunomide, elevations in blood pressure were observed in some subjects. Blood pressure should be checked before starting treatment with leflunomide and monitored periodically thereafter [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]."

        "Drug Interactions Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of leflunomide) concentration (see PRECAUTIONS - General - Need for Drug Elimination ). Hepatotoxic Drugs Increased side effects may occur when leflunomide is given concomitantly with hepatotoxic substances. This is also to be considered when leflunomide treatment is followed by such drugs without a drug elimination procedure. In a small (n=30) combination study of ARAVA with methotrexate, a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients. All elevations resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. A >3-fold increase was seen in another 5 patients. All of these also resolved, 2 with continuation of both drugs and 3 after discontinuation of leflunomide. Three patients met \"ACR criteria\" for liver biopsy (1: Roegnik Grade I, 2: Roegnik Grade IIIa). No pharmacokinetic interaction was identified (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). NSAIDs In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 - 50% in the free fraction of diclofenac and ibuprofen at concentrations in the clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, there was extensive concomitant use of NSAIDs in clinical studies and no differential effect was observed. Tolbutamide In in vitro studies, M1 was shown to cause increases ranging from 13 - 50% in the free fraction of tolbutamide at concentrations in the clinical range. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Rifampin Following concomitant administration of a single dose of ARAVA to subjects receiving multiple doses of rifampin, M1 peak levels were increased (~40%) over those seen when ARAVA was given alone. Because of the potential for ARAVA levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both ARAVA and rifampin. Warfarin Increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) when ARAVA and warfarin were co-administered has been rarely reported."

In addition, the following adverse events have been reported in 1% to <3% of the RA patients in the leflunomide treatment group in controlled clinical trials. Body as a Whole: abscess, cyst, fever, hernia, malaise, pain, neck pain, pelvic pain; Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, migraine, palpitation, tachycardia, varicose vein, vasculitis, vasodilatation; Gastrointestinal: cholelithiasis, colitis, constipation, esophagitis, flatulence, gastritis, gingivitis, melena, oral moniliasis, pharyngitis, salivary gland enlarged, stomatitis (or aphthous stomatitis), tooth disorder; Endocrine: diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism; Hemic and Lymphatic System: anemia (including iron deficiency anemia), ecchymosis; Metabolic and Nutritional: creatine phosphokinase increased, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, peripheral edema; Musculo-Skeletal System: arthrosis, bone necrosis, bone pain, bursitis, muscle cramps, myalgia, tendon rupture; Nervous System: anxiety, depression, dry mouth, insomnia, neuralgia, neuritis, sleep disorder, sweating increased, vertigo; Respiratory System: asthma, dyspnea, epistaxis, lung disorder; Skin and Appendages: acne, contact dermatitis, fungal dermatitis, hair discoloration, hematoma, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, maculopapular rash, nail disorder, skin discoloration, skin disorder, skin nodule, subcutaneous nodule, ulcer skin; Special Senses: blurred vision, cataract, conjunctivitis, eye disorder, taste perversion; Urogenital System: albuminuria, cystitis, dysuria, hematuria, menstrual disorder, prostate disorder, urinary frequency, vaginal moniliasis. Other less common adverse events seen in clinical trials include: 1 case of anaphylactic reaction occurred in Phase 2 following rechallenge of drug after withdrawal due to rash (rare); urticaria; eosinophilia; transient thrombocytopenia (rare); and leukopenia <2000 WBC/mm3 (rare). Adverse events during a second year of treatment with leflunomide in clinical trials were consistent with those observed during the first year of treatment and occurred at a similar or lower incidence. In post-marketing experience, the following have been reported: Body as a whole: opportunistic infections, severe infections including sepsis that may be fatal; Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis; Hematologic: agranulocytosis, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia; Hypersensitivity: angioedema; Hepatic: hepatitis, jaundice/cholestasis, severe liver injury such as hepatic failure and acute hepatic necrosis that may be fatal; Respiratory: interstitial lung disease, including interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, which may be fatal; Nervous system: peripheral neuropathy; Skin and Appendages: erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis including cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, pustular psoriasis or worsening psoriasis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Adverse Reactions (Pediatric Patients) The safety of leflunomide was studied in 74 patients with polyarticular course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ranging in age from 3-17 years (47 patients from the active-controlled study and 27 from an open-label safety and pharmacokinetic study). The most common adverse events included abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, oral ulcers, upper respiratory tract infections, alopecia, rash, headache, and dizziness. Less common adverse events included anemia, hypertension, and weight loss. Fourteen pediatric patients experienced ALT and/or AST elevations, nine between 1.2 and 3-fold the upper limit of normal, five between 3 and 8-fold the upper limit of normal."
