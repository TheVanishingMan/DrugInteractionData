        "Drug Interactions Use of daunorubicin in a patient who has previously received doxorubicin increases the risk of cardiotoxicity. Daunorubicin hydrochloride should not be used in patients who have previously received the recommended maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin or daunorubicin hydrochloride. Cyclophosphamide used concurrently with daunorubicin hydrochloride may also result in increased cardiotoxicity. Dosage reduction of daunorubicin hydrochloride may be required when used concurrently with other myelosuppressive agents.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Dose-limiting toxicity includes myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity (see WARNINGS section). Other reactions include: Cutaneous Reversible alopecia occurs in most patients. Rash, contact dermatitis and urticaria have occurred rarely. Gastrointestinal Acute nausea and vomiting occur but are usually mild. Antiemetic therapy may be of some help. Mucositis may occur 3 to 7 days after administration. Diarrhea and abdominal pain have occasionally been reported. Local If extravasation occurs during administration, severe local tissue necrosis, severe cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, or painful induration can result. Acute Reactions Rarely, anaphylactoid reaction, fever, and chills can occur. Hyperuricemia may occur, especially in patients with leukemia, and serum uric acid levels should be monitored."

        "brand_name": [
          "DaunoXome"
 
      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions In the patient population studied, DaunoXome has been administered to patients receiving a variety of concomitant medications (e.g., antiretroviral agents, antiviral agents, anti-infective agents). Although interactions of DaunoXome (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) with other drugs have not been observed, no systematic studies of interactions have been conducted."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS DaunoXome contains daunorubicin, encapsulated within a liposome. Conventional daunorubicin has acute myelosuppression as its dose limiting side effect, with the greatest effect on the granulocytic series. In addition, daunorubicin causes alopecia, and nausea and vomiting in a significant number of patients treated. Extravasation of conventional daunorubicin can cause severe local tissue necrosis. Chronic therapy at total doses above 300 mg/m2 causes a cumulative-dose-related cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure. Administered as DaunoXome, daunorubicin has substantially altered pharmacokinetics and some differences in toxicity. The most important acute toxicity of DaunoXome remains myelosuppression, principally of the granulocytic series, with much less marked effects on the platelets and erythroid series. In an open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted in 13 centers in the U.S.A. and Canada in advanced HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma, two treatment regimens were compared as first line cytotoxic therapy: DaunoXome and ABV (doxorubicin (Adriamycin(R)), bleomycin, and vincristine). All drugs were administered intravenously every 2 weeks. The safety data presented below include all reported or observed adverse experiences, including those not considered to be drug related. Patients with advanced HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma are seriously ill due to their underlying infection and are receiving several concomitant medications including potentially toxic antiviral and antiretroviral agents. The contribution of the study drugs to the adverse experience profile is therefore difficult to establish. Table III summarizes the important safety data. TABLE III SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT SAFETY DATA DaunoXome (N = 116) % of patients ABV (N = 111) % of patients * The denominator is uncertain since there were several instances of missing repeat cardiac evaluations. ** p = 0.21 *** p = < 0.001 Neutropenia (< 1000 cells/mm3) 36% 35% Neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) 15% 5% Opportunistic Infections/Illnesses,% of patients 40% 27% Median time to first Opportunistic Infections/Illnesses 214 days 412 days** Number of cases with absolute reduction in ejection fraction of 20 - 25%* 3 1 Number of cases removed from therapy due to cardiac causes* 2 0 Alopecia All grades % of patients 8% 36%*** Neuropathy All grades % of patients 13% 41%*** A triad of back pain, flushing and chest tightness was reported in 13.8% of the patients (16/116) treated with DaunoXome in the Phase III clinical trial and in 2.7% of treatment cycles (27/994). Most of the episodes were mild to moderate in severity (12% of patients and 2.5% of treatment cycles). Mild alopecia was reported in 6% of patients treated with DaunoXome and moderate alopecia in 2% of patients. Mild nausea was reported in 35% of DaunoXome patients, moderate nausea in 16% of patients and severe nausea in 3% of patients. For patients treated with DaunoXome, mild vomiting was reported in 10%, moderate in 10%, and severe in 3% of patients. Although grade 3 - 4 injection site inflammation was reported in 2 patients treated with DaunoXome, no instances of local tissue necrosis were observed with extravasation. Table IV is a listing of all the mild-moderate and severe adverse events reported on both treatment arms in Protocol 103-09 in >= 5% of DaunoXome patients.
