      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions It is not advisable to combine, simultaneously or sequentially, cancer chemotherapeutic agents or a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and a therapeutic modality having the same mechanism of action. Therefore, thiotepa combined with other alkylating agents such as nitrogen mustard or cyclophosphamide or thiotepa combined with irradiation would serve to intensify toxicity rather than to enhance therapeutic response. If these agents must follow each other, it is important that recovery from the first agent, as indicated by white blood cell count, be complete before therapy with the second agent is instituted. Other drugs which are known to produce bone-marrow depression should be avoided."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to its effect on the blood-forming elements (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections), thiotepa may cause other adverse reactions. General Fatigue, weakness. Febrile reaction and discharge from a subcutaneous lesion may occur as the result of breakdown of tumor tissue. Hypersensitivity Reactions Allergic reactions - rash, urticaria, laryngeal edema, asthma, anaphylactic shock, wheezing. Local Reactions Contact dermatitis, pain at the injection site. Gastrointestinal Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia. Renal Dysuria, urinary retention. There have been rare reports of chemical cystitis or hemorrhagic cystitis following intravesical, but not parenteral administration of thiotepa. Respiratory Prolonged apnea has been reported when succinylcholine was administered prior to surgery, following combined use of thiotepa and other anticancer agents. It was theorized that this was caused by decrease of pseudocholinesterase activity caused by the anticancer drugs. Neurologic Dizziness, headache, blurred vision. Skin Dermatitis, alopecia. Skin depigmentation has been reported following topical use. Special Senses Conjunctivitis. Reproductive Amenorrhea, interference with spermatogenesis."
