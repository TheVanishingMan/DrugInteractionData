        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in another section of the label Schedule-Dependent Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] Exacerbation of Radiation Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Capillary Leak Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] The most common adverse reactions for the single agent (>=20%) are nausea/vomiting, anemia, hepatic transaminitis, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and peripheral edema (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (>=20%) adverse reactions of single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection USP are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (>=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection USP due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection USP across 5 clinical trials. Table 5 includes all clinical adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table.

Pulmonary - Dyspnea unrelated to underlying disease and sometimes accompanied by bronchospasm. Edema - Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%); <1% of patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection USP due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms - Characterized by fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, myalgia, asthenia insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and/or malaise (19%); <1% of patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection USP due to flu-like symptoms Infection - Sepsis (<1%) Extravasation - Injection-site reactions (4%) Allergic - Bronchospasm (<2%); anaphylactoid reactions [see Contraindications (4)]. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of Gemcitabine for Injection USP-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the Gemcitabine for Injection USP plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of Gemcitabine for Injection USP plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients randomized to Gemcitabine for Injection USP plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the Gemcitabine for Injection USP plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table. Patients in the Gemcitabine for Injection USP cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for treatment-related adverse events was 22% (GC) and 27% in the (EC) arm. The proportion of discontinuation of treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions was higher for patients in the (GC) arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the (GC) arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the Gemcitabine for Injection USP/cisplatin arm.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP. (5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine for Injection USP, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of Gemcitabine for Injection USP is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent and the risks are increased when Gemcitabine for Injection USP is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemcitabine for Injection USP. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome to include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection USP. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine for Injection USP, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection USP is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) - Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which Gemcitabine for Injection USP was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) - Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemcitabine for Injection USP is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemcitabine for Injection USP after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP if PRES develops during therapy."

Pulmonary - Dyspnea unrelated to underlying disease and sometimes accompanied by bronchospasm. Edema - Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%); <1% of patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms -Characterized by fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, myalgia, asthenia insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and/or malaise (19%); <1% of patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection due to flu-like symptoms Infection - Sepsis (<1%) Extravasation - Injection-site reactions (4%) Allergic -Bronchospasm (<2%); anaphylactoid reactions [see Contraindications ( 4)] . Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of Gemcitabine for Injection-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3)] . Patients randomized to Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table. Patients in the Gemcitabine for Injection cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for treatment-related adverse events was 22% (GC) and 27% in the (EC) arm. The proportion of discontinuation of treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions was higher for patients in the (GC) arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the (GC) arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the Gemcitabine for Injection/cisplatin arm.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular — Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, Arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias Vascular Disorders —Peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, and capillary leak syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions 5.8] Skin — Cellulitis, severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions Hepatic — Hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease Pulmonary — Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Nervous System — Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9)]"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly.( 5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression.( 5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity.( 5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection for HUS or severe renal impairment.( 5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection for severe hepatic toxicity. ( 5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus.( 5.6, 8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy.( 5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection. ( 5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection. ( 5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine for Injection, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of Gemcitabine for Injection is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent and the risks are increased when Gemcitabine for Injection is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemcitabine for Injection. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2)] . 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome to include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2)] . Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5) and Use In Specific Populations ( 8.6)] . Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2)] . Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7)] . Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine for Injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations ( 8.1)] 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) — Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which Gemcitabine for Injection was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m 2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) — Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemcitabine for Injection is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemcitabine for Injection after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection if PRES develops during therapy."

Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (>=20%) adverse reactions of single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (>=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection across 5 clinical trials. Table 5 includes all clinical adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table.

Pulmonary - Dyspnea unrelated to underlying disease and sometimes accompanied by bronchospasm. Edema - Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%); <1% of patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms - Characterized by fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, myalgia, asthenia insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and/or malaise (19%); <1% of patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection due to flu-like symptoms Infection - Sepsis (<1%) Extravasation - Injection-site reactions (4%) Allergic - Bronchospasm (<2%); anaphylactoid reactions [see Contraindications (4)]. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of Gemcitabine for Injection-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients randomized to Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table. Patients in the Gemcitabine for Injection cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for treatment-related adverse events was 22% (GC) and 27% in the (EC) arm. The proportion of discontinuation of treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions was higher for patients in the (GC) arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the (GC) arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the Gemcitabine for Injection/cisplatin arm.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection. (5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine for Injection, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of Gemcitabine for Injection is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent and the risks are increased when Gemcitabine for Injection is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemcitabine for Injection. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome to include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine for Injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) - Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which Gemcitabine for Injection was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) - Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemcitabine for Injection is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemcitabine for Injection after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection if PRES develops during therapy."

Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions of single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection USP are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (greater than or equal to 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection USP due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection USP across 5 clinical trials.

Transfusion requirements — Red blood cell transfusions (19%); platelet transfusions (less than 1%) Fever — Fever occurred in the absence of clinical infection and frequently in combination with other flu-like symptoms. Pulmonary — Dyspnea unrelated to underlying disease and sometimes accompanied by bronchospasm. Edema — Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (less than 1%); less than1% of patients. discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection USP due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms — Characterized by fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, myalgia, asthenia insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and/or malaise (19%); less than1% of patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection USP due to flu-like symptoms Infection — Sepsis (less than 1%) Extravasation — Injection-site reactions (4%) Allergic — Bronchospasm (less than 2%); anaphylactoid reactions [see Contraindications (4)]. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients randomized to gemcitabine plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (greater than 90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus less than 1%) were all higher in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment- related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

Table 7 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (n=69) administered in 21-day cycles as compared to etoposide plus cisplatin alone (n=66) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table. Patients in the gemcitabine cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for treatment-related adverse events was 22% (GC) and 27% in the (EC) arm. The proportion of discontinuation of treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions was higher for patients in the (GC) arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the (GC) arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the gemcitabine/cisplatin arm.

Breast Cancer Table 8 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine plus paclitaxel arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine plus paclitaxel (n=262) compared to paclitaxel alone (n=259) for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in women who received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy in the adjuvant/neo-adjuvant setting or for whom anthracyclines were contraindicated. [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The requirement for dose reduction of paclitaxel were higher for patients in the gemcitabine/paclitaxel arm (5% versus 2%). The number of paclitaxel doses omitted (less than 1%), the proportion of patients discontinuing treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions (7% versus 5%), and the number of treatment-related deaths (1 patient in each arm) were similar between the two arms.

Ovarian Cancer Table 9 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine plus carboplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine plus carboplatin (n=175) compared to carboplatin alone (n=174) for the second-line treatment of ovarian cancer in women with disease that had relapsed more than 6 months following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Additional clinically significant adverse reactions, occurring in less than 10% of patients, are provided following Table 9. The proportion of patients with dose adjustments for carboplatin (1.8% versus 3.8%), doses of carboplatin omitted (0.2% versus 0), and discontinuing treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions (10.9% versus 9.8%), were similar between arms. Dose adjustment for gemcitabine occurred in 10.4% of patients and gemcitabine dose was omitted in 13.7% of patients in the gemcitabine/carboplatin arm.

Hematopoietic growth factors were administered more frequently in the gemcitabine-containing arm: granulocyte growth factors (23.6% and 10.1%) and erythropoietic agents (7.3% and 3.9%). The following clinically relevant, Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred more frequently in the gemcitabine plus carboplatin arm: dyspnea (3.4% versus 2.9%), febrile neutropenia (1.1% versus 0), hemorrhagic event (2.3% versus 1.1 %), motor neuropathy (1.1% versus 0.6%), and rash/desquamation (0.6% versus 0). 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Gemcitabine for Injection USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular — Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, Arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias. Vascular Disorders — Peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, and capillary leak syndrome[ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Skin — Cellulitis, severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions Hepatic — Hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease Pulmonary — Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Nervous System— Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue gemcitabine immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days ofradiation therapy. (5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue gemcitabine. (5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue gemcitabine. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine for Injection USP, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of gemcitabine is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with gemcitabine as a single agent and the risks are increased when gemcitabine is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent. The frequencies of Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemcitabine for Injection USP. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome to include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection USP. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN)[ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1and 6.2)]. Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine for Injection USP, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection USP is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or less than or equal to 7 days apart)— Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which Gemcitabine for Injection USP was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given greater than 7 days apart)— Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemcitabine for Injection USP is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemcitabine for Injection USP after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP if PRES develops during therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions for the single-agent (>=20%) are nausea and vomiting, anemia, ALT, AST, neutropenia, leukopenia, alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Watson Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most adverse reactions are reversible and do not need to result in discontinuation, although doses may need to be withheld or reduced. Gemcitabine has been used in a wide variety of malignancies, both as a single-agent and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Single-Agent Use: Myelosuppression is the principal dose-limiting toxicity with gemcitabine therapy. Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity are frequently needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , and 2.4 ) ]. The data in Table 4 are based on 979 patients receiving gemcitabine as a single-agent administered weekly as a 30-minute infusion for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. The gemcitabine starting doses ranged from 800 to 1250 mg/m2. Data are also shown for the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer treated in 5 clinical studies. The frequency of all grades and severe (WHO Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions were generally similar in the single-agent safety database of 979 patients and the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer. Adverse reactions reported in the single-agent safety database resulted in discontinuation of gemcitabine therapy in about 10% of patients. In the comparative trial in pancreatic cancer, the discontinuation rate for adverse reactions was 14.3% for the gemcitabine arm and 4.8% for the 5-FU arm. All WHO-graded laboratory adverse reactions are listed in Table 4, regardless of causality. Non-laboratory adverse reactions listed in Table 4 or discussed below were those reported, regardless of causality, for at least 10% of all patients, except the categories of Extravasation, Allergic, and Cardiovascular and certain specific adverse reactions under the Renal, Pulmonary, and Infection categories.

For approximately 60% of the patients, non-laboratory adverse reactions were graded only if assessed to be possibly drug-related. Hematologic — In studies in pancreatic cancer myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity with gemcitabine, but <1% of patients discontinued therapy for either anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Red blood cell transfusions were required by 19% of patients. The incidence of sepsis was less than 1%. Petechiae or mild blood loss (hemorrhage), from any cause, was reported in 16% of patients; less than 1% of patients required platelet transfusions. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during gemcitabine therapy and dosage modified or suspended according to the degree of hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , and 2.4 ) ]. Gastrointestinal — Nausea and vomiting were commonly reported (69%) but were usually of mild to moderate severity. Severe nausea and vomiting (WHO Grade 3/4) occurred in <15% of patients. Diarrhea was reported by 19% of patients, and stomatitis by 11% of patients. Hepatic — In clinical trials, gemcitabine was associated with transient elevations of one or both serum transaminases in approximately 70% of patients, but there was no evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with either longer duration of exposure to gemcitabine or with greater total cumulative dose. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Renal — In clinical trials, mild proteinuria and hematuria were commonly reported. Clinical findings consistent with the Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) were reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%) receiving gemcitabine in clinical trials. Four patients developed HUS on gemcitabine therapy, 2 immediately post-therapy. The diagnosis of HUS should be considered if the patient develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, reticulocytosis, severe thrombocytopenia, and/or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN). Gemcitabine therapy should be discontinued immediately. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy and dialysis may be required [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Fever — The overall incidence of fever was 41%. This is in contrast to the incidence of infection (16%) and indicates that gemcitabine may cause fever in the absence of clinical infection. Fever was frequently associated with other flu-like symptoms and was usually mild and clinically manageable. Rash — Rash was reported in 30% of patients. The rash was typically a macular or finely granular maculopapular pruritic eruption of mild to moderate severity involving the trunk and extremities. Pruritus was reported for 13% of patients. Pulmonary — In clinical trials, dyspnea, unrelated to underlying disease, has been reported in association with gemcitabine therapy. Dyspnea was occasionally accompanied by bronchospasm. Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. The etiology of these effects is unknown. If such effects develop, gemcitabine should be discontinued. Early use of supportive care measures may help ameliorate these conditions. Edema — Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%) were reported. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms — "Flu syndrome" was reported for 19% of patients. Individual symptoms of fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, and myalgia were commonly reported. Fever and asthenia were also reported frequently as isolated symptoms. Insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and malaise were reported infrequently. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to flu-like symptoms. Infection — Infections were reported for 16% of patients. Sepsis was rarely reported (<1%). Alopecia — Hair loss, usually minimal, was reported by 15% of patients. Neurotoxicity — There was a 10% incidence of mild paresthesias and a <1% rate of severe paresthesias. Extravasation — Injection-site related events were reported for 4% of patients. There were no reports of injection site necrosis. Gemcitabine is not a vesicant. Allergic — Bronchospasm was reported for less than 2% of patients. Anaphylactoid reaction has been reported rarely. Gemcitabine should not be administered to patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Cardiovascular — During clinical trials, 2% of patients discontinued therapy with gemcitabine due to cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension. Many of these patients had a prior history of cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Combination Use in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: In the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 35% of gemcitabine injections and 17% of cisplatin injections on the combination arm, versus 6% on the cisplatin-only arm. Dose adjustments were required in greater than 90% of patients on the combination, versus 16% on cisplatin. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients on the combination arm and 8% of patients on the cisplatin arm. With a median of 4 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment, 94 of 262 patients (36%) experienced a total of 149 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 2 cycles of cisplatin treatment, 61 of 260 patients (23%) experienced 78 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 20% of gemcitabine injections and 16% of cisplatin injections in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared with 20% of etoposide injections and 15% of cisplatin injections in the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. With a median of 5 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment, 15 of 69 patients (22%) experienced 15 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 4 cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin treatment, 18 of 66 patients (27%) experienced 22 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In patients who completed more than one cycle, dose adjustments were reported in 81% of the gemcitabine plus cisplatin patients, compared with 68% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 14% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm and in 8% of patients on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The incidence of myelosuppression was increased in frequency with gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment (~90%) compared to that with the gemcitabine monotherapy (~60%). With combination therapy gemcitabine dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity were required more often while cisplatin dose adjustments were less frequently required. Table 5 presents the safety data from the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study in non-small cell lung cancer. The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) were used. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm. Nine cases of febrile neutropenia were reported on the combination therapy arm compared to 2 on the cisplatin arm. More patients required RBC and platelet transfusions on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. Myelosuppression occurred more frequently on the combination arm, and in 4 possibly treatment-related deaths myelosuppression was observed. Sepsis was reported in 4% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to 1% on the cisplatin arm. Platelet transfusions were required in 21% of patients on the combination arm and <1% of patients on the cisplatin arm. Hemorrhagic events occurred in 14% of patients on the combination arm and 4% on the cisplatin arm. However, severe hemorrhagic events were rare. Red blood cell transfusions were required in 39% of the patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, versus 13% on the cisplatin arm. The data suggest cumulative anemia with continued gemcitabine plus cisplatin use. Nausea and vomiting despite the use of antiemetics occurred more often with gemcitabine plus cisplatin therapy (78%) than with cisplatin alone (71%). In studies with single-agent gemcitabine, a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting (58% to 69%) was reported. Renal function abnormalities, hypomagnesemia, neuromotor, neurocortical, and neurocerebellar toxicity occurred more often with gemcitabine plus cisplatin than with cisplatin monotherapy. Neurohearing toxicity was similar on both arms. Cardiac dysrrhythmias of Grade 3 or greater were reported in 7 (3%) patients treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin compared to one (<1%) Grade 3 dysrrhythmia reported with cisplatin therapy. Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia were associated with one Grade 4 arrhythmia on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination arm. Table 6 presents data from the randomized study of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin in 135 patients with NSCLC. One death (1.5%) was reported on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm due to febrile neutropenia associated with renal failure which was possibly treatment-related. No deaths related to treatment occurred on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The overall incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm was less than on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm (28% versus 56%). Sepsis was experienced by 2% of patients on both treatment arms. Grade 3 anemia and Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia were more common on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. RBC transfusions were given to 29% of the patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus 21% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Platelet transfusions were given to 3% of the patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus 8% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting were also more common on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. On the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, 7% of participants were hospitalized due to febrile neutropenia compared to 12% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. More than twice as many patients had dose reductions or omissions of a scheduled dose of gemcitabine as compared to etoposide, which may explain the differences in the incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia between treatment arms.

Combination Use in Breast Cancer: In the gemcitabine plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel study, dose reductions occurred with 8% of gemcitabine injections and 5% of paclitaxel injections on the combination arm, versus 2% on the paclitaxel arm. On the combination arm, 7% of gemcitabine doses were omitted and <1% of paclitaxel doses were omitted, compared to <1% of paclitaxel doses on the paclitaxel arm. A total of 18 patients (7%) on the gemcitabine plus paclitaxel arm and 12 (5%) on the paclitaxel arm discontinued the study because of adverse reactions. There were two deaths on study or within 30 days after study drug discontinuation that were possibly drug-related, one on each arm.

No differences in the incidence of laboratory and non-laboratory events were observed in patients 65 years or older, as compared to patients younger than 65. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of gemcitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions have occurred after gemcitabine single-agent use and gemcitabine in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Decisions to include these events are based on the seriousness of the event, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to gemcitabine. Cardiovascular — Congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction have been reported very rarely with the use of gemcitabine. Arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular in nature, have been reported very rarely. Vascular Disorders — Clinical signs of peripheral vasculitis and gangrene have been reported very rarely. Skin — Cellulitis and non-serious injection site reactions in the absence of extravasation have been rarely reported. Severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions, have been reported very rarely. Hepatic — Increased liver function tests including elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels have been reported rarely. Serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure and death has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease has been reported. Pulmonary — Parenchymal toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported rarely following one or more doses of gemcitabine administered to patients with various malignancies. Some patients experienced the onset of pulmonary symptoms up to 2 weeks after the last gemcitabine dose. Respiratory failure and death occurred very rarely in some patients despite discontinuation of therapy. Renal — Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been rarely reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS. Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications — Radiation recall reactions have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients receiving therapy with gemcitabine for injection should be monitored closely by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Infusion time and dose frequency: Increased toxicity with infusion time >60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Hematology: Monitor for myelosuppression, which can be dose-limiting. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary toxicity: Discontinue gemcitabine for injection immediately for severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Renal: Monitor renal function prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. Use with caution in patients with renal impairment. Cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure, some fatal, have occurred. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection for HUS or severe renal toxicity. (5.4) Hepatic: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, have occurred. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Radiation toxicity. May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity. (5.8) 5.1 Infusion Time Caution — Prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes and more frequent than weekly dosing have been shown to increase toxicity [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )]. 5.2 Hematology Gemcitabine for injection can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )], and myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , and 2.4 )]. 5.3 Pulmonary Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine for injection. In cases of severe lung toxicity, gemcitabine for injection therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care measures instituted [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 )]. 5.4 Renal Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine for injection. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 ) ]. Gemcitabine for injection should be used with caution in patients with preexisting renal impairment as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.5 Hepatic Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine for injection alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 ) ]. Gemcitabine for injection should be used with caution in patients with preexisting hepatic insufficiency as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations. Administration of gemcitabine for injection in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a preexisting medical history of hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis may lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. 5.6 Pregnancy Gemcitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In pre-clinical studies in mice and rabbits, gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of gemcitabine for injection in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.7 Laboratory Tests Patients receiving gemcitabine for injection should be monitored prior to each dose with a complete blood count (CBC), including differential and platelet count. Suspension or modification of therapy should be considered when marrow suppression is detected [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , and 2.4 )]. Laboratory evaluation of renal and hepatic function should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.8 Radiation Therapy A pattern of tissue injury typically associated with radiation toxicity has been reported in association with concurrent and non-concurrent use of gemcitabine for injection. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) — Analysis of the data does not indicate enhanced toxicity when gemcitabine for injection is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation, other than radiation recall. Data suggest that gemcitabine for injection can be started after the acute effects of radiation have resolved or at least one week after radiation. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) —Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that gemcitabine for injection has radiosensitizing activity. Toxicity associated with this multimodality therapy is dependent on many different factors, including dose of gemcitabine for injection, frequency of gemcitabine for injection administration, dose of radiation, radiotherapy planning technique, the target tissue, and target volume. In a single trial, where gemcitabine for injection at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 was administered concurrently for up to 6 consecutive weeks with therapeutic thoracic radiation to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, significant toxicity in the form of severe, and potentially life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis was observed, particularly in patients receiving large volumes of radiotherapy [median treatment volumes 4795 cm3]. Subsequent studies have been reported and suggest that gemcitabine for injection administered at lower doses with concurrent radiotherapy has predictable and less severe toxicity. However, the optimum regimen for safe administration of gemcitabine for injection with therapeutic doses of radiation has not yet been determined in all tumor types."

Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to gemcitabine as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1,250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (>=20%) adverse reactions of single-agent gemcitabine are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (>=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued gemcitabine due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent gemcitabine across 5 clinical trials. Table 5 includes all clinical adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients randomized to gemcitabine plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment- related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table. Patients in the gemcitabine cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for treatment-related adverse events was 22% (GC) and 27% in the (EC) arm. The proportion of discontinuation of treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions was higher for patients in the (GC) arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the (GC) arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the gemcitabine/cisplatin arm.

[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The requirement for dose reduction of paclitaxel were higher for patients in the gemcitabine/paclitaxel arm (5% versus 2%). The number of paclitaxel doses omitted (<1%), the proportion of patients discontinuing treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions (7% versus 5%), and the number of treatment-related deaths (1 patient in each arm) were similar between the two arms.

Ovarian Cancer Table 9 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine plus carboplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine plus carboplatin (n=175) compared to carboplatin alone (n=174) for the second-line treatment of ovarian cancer in women with disease that had relapsed more than 6 months following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Additional clinically significant adverse reactions, occurring in less than 10% of patients, are provided following Table 9. The proportion of patients with dose adjustments for carboplatin (1.8% versus 3.8%), doses of carboplatin omitted (0.2% versus 0), and discontinuing treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions (10.9% versus 9.8%), were similar between arms. Dose adjustment for gemcitabine occurred in 10.4% of patients and gemcitabine dose was omitted in 13.7% of patients in the gemcitabine /carboplatin arm.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular - Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias. Vascular Disorders - Peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, and capillary leak syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Skin - Cellulitis, severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions Hepatic - Hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease Pulmonary - Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Nervous System — Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue gemcitabine immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life- threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue gemcitabine. (5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue gemcitabine. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of gemcitabine is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with gemcitabine as a single agent and the risks are increased when gemcitabine is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent gemcitabine. The frequencies of Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of gemcitabine. Discontinue gemcitabine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic uremic syndrome, including fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis, can occur in patients treated with gemcitabine. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2,429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of gemcitabine and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue gemcitabine in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Administration of gemcitabine in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of gemcitabine and periodically during treatment. Discontinue gemcitabine in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking gemcitabine, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) - Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) - Excessive toxicity has not been observed when gemcitabine is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive gemcitabine after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue gemcitabine if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue gemcitabine if PRES develops during therapy."

      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions for the single-agent (>=20%) are nausea and vomiting, anemia, ALT, AST, neutropenia, leukopenia, alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most adverse reactions are reversible and do not need to result in discontinuation, although doses may need to be withheld or reduced. Gemcitabine for Injection has been used in a wide variety of malignancies, both as a single-agent and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Single-Agent Use: Myelosuppression is the principal dose-limiting toxicity with Gemcitabine for Injection therapy. Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity are frequently needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. The data in Table 4 are based on 979 patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection as a single-agent administered weekly as a 30-minute infusion for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. The Gemcitabine for Injection starting doses ranged from 800 to 1250 mg/m2. Data are also shown for the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer treated in 5 clinical studies. The frequency of all grades and severe (WHO Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions were generally similar in the single-agent safety database of 979 patients and the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer. Adverse reactions reported in the single-agent safety database resulted in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection therapy in about 10% of patients. In the comparative trial in pancreatic cancer, the discontinuation rate for adverse reactions was 14.3% for the Gemcitabine for Injection arm and 4.8% for the 5-FU arm. All WHO-graded laboratory adverse reactions are listed in Table 4, regardless of causality. Non-laboratory adverse reactions listed in Table 4 or discussed below were those reported, regardless of causality, for at least 10% of all patients, except the categories of Extravasation, Allergic, and Cardiovascular and certain specific adverse reactions under the Renal, Pulmonary and Infection categories.

Red blood cell transfusions were required by 19% of patients. The incidence of sepsis was less than 1%. Petechiae or mild blood loss (hemorrhage), from any cause, was reported in 16% of patients; less than 1% of patients required platelet transfusions. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during Gemcitabine for Injection therapy and dosage modified or suspended according to the degree of hematologic toxicity. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)] Gastrointestinal — Nausea and vomiting were commonly reported (69%) but were usually of mild to moderate severity. Severe nausea and vomiting (WHO Grade 3/4) occurred in <15% of patients. Diarrhea was reported by 19% of patients, and stomatitis by 11% of patients. Hepatic — In clinical trials, Gemcitabine for Injection was associated with transient elevations of one or both serum transaminases in approximately 70% of patients, but there was no evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with either longer duration of exposure to Gemcitabine for Injection or with greater total cumulative dose. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported very rarely in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Renal — In clinical trials, mild proteinuria and hematuria were commonly reported. Clinical findings consistent with the Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) were reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%) receiving Gemcitabine for Injection in clinical trials. Four patients developed HUS on Gemcitabine for Injection therapy, 2 immediately posttherapy. The diagnosis of HUS should be considered if the patient develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, reticulocytosis, severe thrombocytopenia, and/or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN). Gemcitabine for Injection therapy should be discontinued immediately. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy and dialysis may be required. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Fever — The overall incidence of fever was 41%. This is in contrast to the incidence of infection (16%) and indicates that Gemcitabine for Injection may cause fever in the absence of clinical infection. Fever was frequently associated with other flu-like symptoms and was usually mild and clinically manageable. Rash — Rash was reported in 30% of patients. The rash was typically a macular or finely granular maculopapular pruritic eruption of mild to moderate severity involving the trunk and extremities. Pruritus was reported for 13% of patients. Pulmonary — In clinical trials, dyspnea, unrelated to underlying disease, has been reported in association with Gemcitabine for Injection therapy. Dyspnea was occasionally accompanied by bronchospasm. Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of Gemcitabine for Injection. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] The etiology of these effects is unknown. If such effects develop, Gemcitabine for Injection should be discontinued. Early use of supportive care measures may help ameliorate these conditions. Edema — Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%) were reported. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms — \"Flu syndrome\" was reported for 19% of patients. Individual symptoms of fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, and myalgia were commonly reported. Fever and asthenia were also reported frequently as isolated symptoms. Insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and malaise were reported infrequently. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to flu-like symptoms. Infection — Infections were reported for 16% of patients. Sepsis was rarely reported (<1%). Alopecia — Hair loss, usually minimal, was reported by 15% of patients. Neurotoxicity — There was a 10% incidence of mild paresthesias and a <1% rate of severe paresthesias. Extravasation — Injection-site related events were reported for 4% of patients. There were no reports of injection site necrosis. Gemcitabine for Injection is not a vesicant. Allergic — Bronchospasm was reported for less than 2% of patients. Anaphylactoid reaction has been reported rarely. Gemcitabine for Injection should not be administered to patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug [see Contraindications (4)]. Cardiovascular — During clinical trials, 2% of patients discontinued therapy with Gemcitabine for Injection due to cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension. Many of these patients had a prior history of cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Combination Use in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: In the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 35% of Gemcitabine for Injections and 17% of cisplatin injections on the combination arm, versus 6% on the cisplatin-only arm. Dose adjustments were required in greater than 90% of patients on the combination, versus 16% on cisplatin. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients on the combination arm and 8% of patients on the cisplatin arm. With a median of 4 cycles of Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin treatment, 94 of 262 patients (36%) experienced a total of 149 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 2 cycles of cisplatin treatment, 61 of 260 patients (23%) experienced 78 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 20% of Gemcitabine for Injections and 16% of cisplatin injections in the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm compared with 20% of etoposide injections and 15% of cisplatin injections in the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. With a median of 5 cycles of Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin treatment, 15 of 69 patients (22%) experienced 15 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 4 cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin treatment, 18 of 66 patients (27%) experienced 22 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In patients who completed more than one cycle, dose adjustments were reported in 81% of the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin patients, compared with 68% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 14% of patients on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm and in 8% of patients on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The incidence of myelosuppression was increased in frequency with Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin treatment (~90%) compared to that with the Gemcitabine for Injection monotherapy (~60%). With combination therapy Gemcitabine for Injection dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity were required more often while cisplatin dose adjustments were less frequently required. Table 5 presents the safety data from the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study in non-small cell lung cancer. The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) were used. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm. Nine cases of febrile neutropenia were reported on the combination therapy arm compared to 2 on the cisplatin arm. More patients required RBC and platelet transfusions on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm. Myelosuppression occurred more frequently on the combination arm, and in 4 possibly treatment-related deaths myelosuppression was observed. Sepsis was reported in 4% of patients on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm compared to 1% on the cisplatin arm. Platelet transfusions were required in 21% of patients on the combination arm and <1% of patients on the cisplatin arm. Hemorrhagic events occurred in 14% of patients on the combination arm and 4% on the cisplatin arm. However, severe hemorrhagic events were rare. Red blood cell transfusions were required in 39% of the patients on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm, versus 13% on the cisplatin arm. The data suggest cumulative anemia with continued Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin use. Nausea and vomiting despite the use of antiemetics occurred more often with Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin therapy (78%) than with cisplatin alone (71%). In studies with single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection, a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting (58% to 69%) was reported. Renal function abnormalities, hypomagnesemia, neuromotor, neurocortical, and neurocerebellar toxicity occurred more often with Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin than with cisplatin monotherapy. Neurohearing toxicity was similar on both arms. Cardiac dysrrhythmias of Grade 3 or greater were reported in 7 (3%) patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin compared to one (<1%) Grade 3 dysrrhythmia reported with cisplatin therapy. Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia were associated with one Grade 4 arrhythmia on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin combination arm. Table 6 presents data from the randomized study of Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin in 135 patients with NSCLC. One death (1.5%) was reported on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm due to febrile neutropenia associated with renal failure which was possibly treatment-related. No deaths related to treatment occurred on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The overall incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm was less than on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm (28% versus 56%). Sepsis was experienced by 2% of patients on both treatment arms. Grade 3 anemia and Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia were more common on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm. RBC transfusions were given to 29% of the patients who received Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin versus 21% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Platelet transfusions were given to 3% of the patients who received Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin versus 8% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting were also more common on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm. On the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm, 7% of participants were hospitalized due to febrile neutropenia compared to 12% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. More than twice as many patients had dose reductions or omissions of a scheduled dose of Gemcitabine for Injection as compared to etoposide, which may explain the differences in the incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia between treatment arms. Flu syndrome was reported by 3% of patients on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm with none reported on the comparator arm. Eight patients (12%) on the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm reported edema compared to one patient (2%) on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm.

No differences in the incidence of laboratory and non-laboratory events were observed in patients 65 years or older, as compared to patients younger than 65. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Gemcitabine for Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions have occurred after Gemcitabine for Injection single-agent use and Gemcitabine for Injection in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Decisions to include these events are based on the seriousness of the event, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to Gemcitabine for Injection. Cardiovascular — Congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction have been reported very rarely with the use of Gemcitabine for Injection. Arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular in nature, have been reported very rarely. Vascular Disorders — Clinical signs of peripheral vasculitis and gangrene have been reported very rarely. Skin — Cellulitis and non-serious injection site reactions in the absence of extravasation have been rarely reported. Severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions, have been reported very rarely. Hepatic — Increased liver function tests including elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels have been reported rarely. Serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure and death has been reported very rarely in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease has been reported. Pulmonary — Parenchymal toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported rarely following one or more doses of Gemcitabine for Injection administered to patients with various malignancies. Some patients experienced the onset of pulmonary symptoms up to 2 weeks after the last Gemcitabine for Injection dose. Respiratory failure and death occurred very rarely in some patients despite discontinuation of therapy. Renal — Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of Gemcitabine for Injection. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been rarely reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS. Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications — Radiation recall reactions have been reported. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]"

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion time and dose frequency: Increased toxicity with infusion time >60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Hematology: Monitor for myelosuppression, which can be dose-limiting. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary toxicity: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection immediately for severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Renal: Monitor renal function prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. Use with caution in patients with renal impairment. Cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure, some fatal, have occurred. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection for HUS or severe renal toxicity (5.4) Hepatic: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, have occurred. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Radiation toxicity. May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity (5.8) Patients receiving therapy with Gemcitabine for Injection should be monitored closely by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. 5.1 Infusion Time Caution — Prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes and more frequent than weekly dosing have been shown to increase toxicity [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. 5.2 Hematology Gemcitabine for Injection can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], and myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)] 5.3 Pulmonary Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of Gemcitabine for Injection. In cases of severe lung toxicity, Gemcitabine for Injection therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care measures instituted [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Renal Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of Gemcitabine for Injection. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Gemcitabine for Injection should be used with caution in patients with preexisting renal impairment as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.5 Hepatic Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Gemcitabine for Injection should be used with caution in patients with preexisting hepatic insufficiency as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations. Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a preexisting medical history of hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis may lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.7)] 5.6 Pregnancy Gemcitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In pre-clinical studies in mice and rabbits, gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Gemcitabine for Injection in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.7 Laboratory Tests Patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection should be monitored prior to each dose with a complete blood count (CBC), including differential and platelet count. Suspension or modification of therapy should be considered when marrow suppression is detected. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)] Laboratory evaluation of renal and hepatic function should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.8 Radiation Therapy A pattern of tissue injury typically associated with radiation toxicity has been reported in association with concurrent and non-concurrent use of Gemcitabine for Injection. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) — Analysis of the data does not indicate enhanced toxicity when Gemcitabine for Injection is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation, other than radiation recall. Data suggest that Gemcitabine for Injection can be started after the acute effects of radiation have resolved or at least one week after radiation. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) — Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that Gemcitabine for Injection has radiosensitizing activity. Toxicity associated with this multimodality therapy is dependent on many different factors, including dose of Gemcitabine for Injection, frequency of Gemcitabine for Injection administration, dose of radiation, radiotherapy planning technique, the target tissue, and target volume. In a single trial, where Gemcitabine for Injection at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 was administered concurrently for up to 6 consecutive weeks with therapeutic thoracic radiation to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, significant toxicity in the form of severe, and potentially life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis was observed, particularly in patients receiving large volumes of radiotherapy [median treatment volumes 4795 cm3]. Subsequent studies have been reported and suggest that Gemcitabine for Injection administered at lower doses with concurrent radiotherapy has predictable and less severe toxicity. However, the optimum regimen for safe administration of Gemcitabine for Injection with therapeutic doses of radiation has not yet been determined in all tumor types."

Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions of single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection USP are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (greater than or equal to 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection USP due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients randomized to gemcitabine plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (greater than 90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus less than 1%) were all higher in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment- related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular — Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, Arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias. Vascular Disorders — Peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, and capillary leak syndrome[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Skin — Cellulitis, severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions Hepatic — Hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease Pulmonary — Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Nervous System— Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue gemcitabine immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6,8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days ofradiation therapy. (5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue gemcitabine. (5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue gemcitabine. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine for Injection USP, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of gemcitabine is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with gemcitabine as a single agent and the risks are increased when gemcitabine is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent. The frequencies of Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemcitabine for Injection USP. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome to include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection USP. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN)[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1and 6.2)]. Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine for Injection USP, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection USP is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or less than or equal to 7 days apart)— Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which Gemcitabine for Injection USP was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given greater than 7 days apart)— Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemcitabine for Injection USP is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemcitabine for Injection USP after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP if PRES develops during therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in another section of the label Schedule-dependent Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Embryofetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] Exacerbation of Radiation Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Capillary Leak Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] The most common adverse reactions for the single agent (>=20%) are nausea/vomiting, anemia, hepatic transaminitis, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and peripheral edema. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to Gemzar as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (>=20%) adverse reactions of single-agent Gemzar are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (>=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued Gemzar due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemzar in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemzar in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent Gemzar across 5 clinical trials. Table 5 includes all clinical adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of Gemzar-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the Gemzar plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of Gemzar plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients randomized to Gemzar plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving Gemzar plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the Gemzar plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table. Patients in the Gemzar cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for treatment-related adverse events was 22% (GC) and 27% in the (EC) arm. The proportion of discontinuation of treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions was higher for patients in the (GC) arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the (GC) arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the Gemzar/cisplatin arm.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular — Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias Vascular Disorders — Peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, and capillary leak syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Skin — Cellulitis, severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions Hepatic — Hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease Pulmonary — Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Nervous System — Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue Gemzar immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemzar for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemzar for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemzar. (5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue Gemzar. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemzar, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of Gemzar is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with Gemzar as a single agent and the risks are increased when Gemzar is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent Gemzar. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemzar in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemzar. Discontinue Gemzar in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic uremic syndrome, including fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis, can occur in patients treated with Gemzar. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemzar and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue Gemzar in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemzar alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Administration of Gemzar in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemzar and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemzar in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemzar can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemzar, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemzar is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) — Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which Gemzar was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) — Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemzar is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemzar after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving Gemzar as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue Gemzar if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving Gemzar as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue Gemzar if PRES develops during therapy."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to gemcitabine as a single-agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (>=20%) adverse reactions of single-agent Gemcitabine are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (>=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued Gemcitabine due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent Gemcitabine across 5 clinical trials. Table 5 includes all clinical adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients randomized to gemcitabine plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) -Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) -Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue gemcitabine immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) -Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) -Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) -Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) -Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (5.7) -Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection. (5.8) -Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of Gemcitabine is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with Gemcitabine as a single agent and the risks are increased when Gemcitabine is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent Gemcitabine. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of gemcitabine. Discontinue Gemcitabine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, including fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis, can occur in patients treated with gemcitabine. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2)]. Administration of gemcitabine in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history of hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemcitabine in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine is not indicated for use in combination with radiation with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <= 7 days apart) - Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) - Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemcitabine is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemcitabine after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue gemcitabine if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue Gemcitabine if PRES develops during therapy.",

Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] The most common adverse reactions for the single agent (>=20%) are nausea/vomiting, anemia, hepatic transaminitis, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and peripheral edema (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to gemcitabine for injection as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (>=20%) adverse reactions of single-agent gemcitabine for injection are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (>=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued gemcitabine for injection due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine for injection in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine for injection in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent gemcitabine for injection across 5 clinical trials. Table 5 includes all clinical adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table.

Transfusion requirements — Red blood cell transfusions (19%); platelet transfusions (<1%) Fever — Fever occurred in the absence of clinical infection and frequently in combination with other flu-like symptoms. Pulmonary — Dyspnea unrelated to underlying disease and sometimes accompanied by bronchospasm. Edema — Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%); <1% of patients. discontinued gemcitabine for injection due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms — Characterized by fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, myalgia, asthenia insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and/or malaise (19%); <1% of patients discontinued gemcitabine for injection due to flu-like symptoms Infection — Sepsis (<1%) Extravasation — Injection-site reactions (4%) Allergic — Bronchospasm (<2%); anaphylactoid reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of gemcitabine for injection-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Patients randomized to gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table. Patients in the gemcitabine for injection cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for treatment-related adverse events was 22% (GC) and 27% in the (EC) arm. The proportion of discontinuation of treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions was higher for patients in the (GC) arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the (GC) arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the gemcitabine for injection /cisplatin arm.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients receiving therapy with gemcitabine for injection should be monitored closely by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue gemcitabine for injection immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue gemcitabine for injection. (5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue gemcitabine for injection. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine for injection, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of gemcitabine for injection is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with gemcitabine for injection as a single agent and the risks are increased when gemcitabine for injection is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving gemcitabine for injection in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of gemcitabine for injection. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 )]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome to include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with gemcitabine for injection. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 )]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of gemcitabine for injection and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Permanently discontinue gemcitabine for injection in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine for injection alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2)]. Administration of gemcitabine for injection in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of gemcitabine for injection and periodically during treatment. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking gemcitabine for injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1) ] 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for injection is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) — Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which gemcitabine for injection was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) — Excessive toxicity has not been observed when gemcitabine for injection is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive gemcitabine for injection after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine for injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine for injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue gemcitabine for injection if PRES develops during therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions for the single-agent (>=20%) are nausea and vomiting, anemia, ALT, AST, neutropenia, leukopenia, alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact hameln rds gmbh at +49-5151-581-0 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact at or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most adverse reactions are reversible and do not need to result in discontinuation, although doses may need to be withheld or reduced. Gemcitabine has been used in a wide variety of malignancies, both as a single-agent and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Single-Agent Use: Myelosuppression is the principal dose-limiting toxicity with Gemcitabine for Injection USP therapy. Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity are frequently needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. The data in Table 4 are based on 979 patients receiving gemcitabine as a single-agent administered weekly as a 30-minute infusion for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. The gemcitabine starting doses ranged from 800 to 1250 mg/m2. Data are also shown for the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer treated in 5 clinical studies. The frequency of all grades and severe (WHO Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions were generally similar in the single-agent safety database of 979 patients and the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer. Adverse reactions reported in the single-agent safety database resulted in discontinuation of gemcitabine therapy in about 10% of patients. In the comparative trial in pancreatic cancer, the discontinuation rate for adverse reactions was 14.3% for the gemcitabine arm and 4.8% for the 5-FU arm. All WHO-graded laboratory adverse reactions are listed in Table 4, regardless of causality. Non-laboratory adverse reactions listed in Table 4 or discussed below were those reported, regardless of causality, for at least 10% of all patients, except the categories of Extravasation, Allergic, and Cardiovascular and certain specific adverse reactions under the Renal, Pulmonary, and Infection categories.

Red blood cell transfusions were required by 19% of patients. The incidence of sepsis was less than 1%. Petechiae or mild blood loss (hemorrhage), from any cause, was reported in 16% of patients; less than 1% of patients required platelet transfusions. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during Gemcitabine for Injection USP therapy and dosage modified or suspended according to the degree of hematologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. Gastrointestinal — Nausea and vomiting were commonly reported (69%) but were usually of mild to moderate severity. Severe nausea and vomiting (WHO Grade 3/4) occurred in <15% of patients. Diarrhea was reported by 19% of patients, and stomatitis by 11% of patients. Hepatic — In clinical trials, gemcitabine was associated with transient elevations of one or both serum transaminases in approximately 70% of patients, but there was no evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with either longer duration of exposure to gemcitabine or with greater total cumulative dose. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Renal — In clinical trials, mild proteinuria and hematuria were commonly reported. Clinical findings consistent with the Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) were reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%) receiving gemcitabine in clinical trials. Four patients developed HUS on gemcitabine therapy, 2 immediately posttherapy. The diagnosis of HUS should be considered if the patient develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, reticulocytosis, severe thrombocytopenia, and/or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN). Gemcitabine for Injection USP therapy should be discontinued immediately. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy and dialysis may be required [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Fever — The overall incidence of fever was 41%. This is in contrast to the incidence of infection (16%) and indicates that Gemcitabine for Injection USP may cause fever in the absence of clinical infection. Fever was frequently associated with other flu-like symptoms and was usually mild and clinically manageable. Rash — Rash was reported in 30% of patients. The rash was typically a macular or finely granular maculopapular pruritic eruption of mild to moderate severity involving the trunk and extremities. Pruritus was reported for 13% of patients. Pulmonary — In clinical trials, dyspnea, unrelated to underlying disease, has been reported in association with gemcitabine therapy. Dyspnea was occasionally accompanied by bronchospasm. Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The etiology of these effects is unknown. If such effects develop, Gemcitabine for Injection USP should be discontinued. Early use of supportive care measures may help ameliorate these conditions. Edema — Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%) were reported. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms — \"Flu syndrome\" was reported for 19% of patients. Individual symptoms of fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, and myalgia were commonly reported. Fever and asthenia were also reported frequently as isolated symptoms. Insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and malaise were reported infrequently. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to flu-like symptoms. Infection — Infections were reported for 16% of patients. Sepsis was rarely reported (<1%). Alopecia — Hair loss, usually minimal, was reported by 15% of patients. Neurotoxicity — There was a 10% incidence of mild paresthesias and a <1% rate of severe paresthesias. Extravasation — Injection-site related events were reported for 4% of patients. There were no reports of injection site necrosis. Gemcitabine for Injection USP is not a vesicant. Allergic — Bronchospasm was reported for less than 2% of patients. Anaphylactoid reaction has been reported rarely. Gemcitabine for Injection USP should not be administered to patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug [see Contraindications (4)]. Cardiovascular — During clinical trials, 2% of patients discontinued therapy with gemcitabine due to cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension. Many of these patients had a prior history of cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Combination Use in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: In the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 35% of gemcitabine injections and 17% of cisplatin injections on the combination arm, versus 6% on the cisplatin-only arm. Dose adjustments were required in greater than 90% of patients on the combination, versus 16% on cisplatin. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients on the combination arm and 8% of patients on the cisplatin arm. With a median of 4 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment, 94 of 262 patients (36%) experienced a total of 149 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 2 cycles of cisplatin treatment, 61 of 260 patients (23%) experienced 78 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 20% of gemcitabine injections and 16% of cisplatin injections in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared with 20% of etoposide injections and 15% of cisplatin injections in the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. With a median of 5 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment, 15 of 69 patients (22%) experienced 15 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 4 cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin treatment, 18 of 66 patients (27%) experienced 22 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In patients who completed more than one cycle, dose adjustments were reported in 81% of the gemcitabine plus cisplatin patients, compared with 68% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 14% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm and in 8% of patients on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The incidence of myelosuppression was increased in frequency with gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment (~90%) compared to that with the gemcitabine monotherapy (~60%). With combination therapy gemcitabine dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity were required more often while cisplatin dose adjustments were less frequently required. Table 5 presents the safety data from the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study in non-small cell lung cancer. The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) were used. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm. Nine cases of febrile neutropenia were reported on the combination therapy arm compared to 2 on the cisplatin arm. More patients required RBC and platelet transfusions on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. Myelosuppression occurred more frequently on the combination arm, and in 4 possibly treatment-related deaths myelosuppression was observed. Sepsis was reported in 4% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to 1% on the cisplatin arm. Platelet transfusions were required in 21% of patients on the combination arm and <1% of patients on the cisplatin arm. Hemorrhagic events occurred in 14% of patients on the combination arm and 4% on the cisplatin arm. However, severe hemorrhagic events were rare. Red blood cell transfusions were required in 39% of the patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, versus 13% on the cisplatin arm. The data suggest cumulative anemia with continued gemcitabine plus cisplatin use. Nausea and vomiting despite the use of antiemetics occurred more often with gemcitabine plus cisplatin therapy (78%) than with cisplatin alone (71%). In studies with single-agent gemcitabine, a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting (58% to 69%) was reported. Renal function abnormalities, hypomagnesemia, neuromotor, neurocortical, and neurocerebellar toxicity occurred more often with gemcitabine plus cisplatin than with cisplatin monotherapy. Neurohearing toxicity was similar on both arms. Cardiac dysrrhythmias of Grade 3 or greater were reported in 7 (3%) patients treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin compared to one (<1%) Grade 3 dysrrhythmia reported with cisplatin therapy. Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia were associated with one Grade 4 arrhythmia on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination arm. Table 6 presents data from the randomized study of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin in 135 patients with NSCLC. One death (1.5%) was reported on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm due to febrile neutropenia associated with renal failure which was possibly treatment-related. No deaths related to treatment occurred on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The overall incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm was less than on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm (28% versus 56%). Sepsis was experienced by 2% of patients on both treatment arms. Grade 3 anemia and Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia were more common on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. RBC transfusions were given to 29% of the patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus 21% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Platelet transfusions were given to 3% of the patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus 8% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting were also more common on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. On the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, 7% of participants were hospitalized due to febrile neutropenia compared to 12% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. More than twice as many patients had dose reductions or omissions of a scheduled dose of gemcitabine as compared to etoposide, which may explain the differences in the incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia between treatment arms. Flu syndrome was reported by 3% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm with none reported on the comparator arm. Eight patients (12%) on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm reported edema compared to one patient (2%) on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm.

On the combination arm, 7% of gemcitabine doses were omitted and <1% of paclitaxel doses were omitted, compared to <1% of paclitaxel doses on the paclitaxel arm. A total of 18 patients (7%) on the gemcitabine plus paclitaxel arm and 12 (5%) on the paclitaxel arm discontinued the study because of adverse reactions. There were two deaths on study or within 30 days after study drug discontinuation that were possibly drug-related, one on each arm.

No differences in the incidence of laboratory and non-laboratory events were observed in patients 65 years or older, as compared to patients younger than 65. Combination Use in Ovarian Cancer: In the gemcitabine plus carboplatin versus carboplatin study, dose reductions occurred with 10.4% of gemcitabine injections and 1.8% of carboplatin injections on the combination arm, versus 3.8% on the carboplatin alone arm. On the combination arm, 13.7% of gemcitabine doses were omitted and 0.2% of carboplatin doses were omitted, compared to 0% of carboplatin doses on the carboplatin alone arm. There were no differences in discontinuations due to adverse reactions between arms (10.9% versus 9.8%, respectively). Table 8 presents the adverse reactions (all grades) occurring in >=10% of patients in the ovarian cancer study.

The following are the clinically relevant adverse reactions, regardless of causality, that occurred in >1% and <10% (all grades) of patients on either arm. In parentheses are the incidences of Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions (gemcitabine plus carboplatin versus carboplatin): AST or ALT elevation (0 versus 1.2%), dyspnea (3.4% versus 2.9%), febrile neutropenia (1.1% versus 0), hemorrhagic event (2.3% versus 1.1%), hypersensitivity reaction (2.3% versus 2.9%), motor neuropathy (1.1% versus 0.6%), and rash/desquamation (0.6% versus 0). No differences in the incidence of laboratory and non-laboratory events were observed in patients 65 years or older, as compared to patients younger than 65. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of gemcitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions have occurred after gemcitabine single-agent use and gemcitabine in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Decisions to include these events are based on the seriousness of the event, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to gemcitabine. Cardiovascular — Congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction have been reported very rarely with the use of gemcitabine. Arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular in nature, have been reported very rarely. Vascular Disorders — Clinical signs of peripheral vasculitis and gangrene have been reported very rarely. Skin — Cellulitis and non-serious injection site reactions in the absence of extravasation have been rarely reported. Severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions, have been reported very rarely. Hepatic — Increased liver function tests including elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels have been reported rarely. Serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure and death has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Hepatic venoocclusive disease has been reported. Pulmonary — Parenchymal toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported rarely following one or more doses of gemcitabine administered to patients with various malignancies. Some patients experienced the onset of pulmonary symptoms up to 2 weeks after the last gemcitabine dose. Respiratory failure and death occurred very rarely in some patients despite discontinuation of therapy. Renal — Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been rarely reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS. Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications — Radiation recall reactions have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients receiving therapy with Gemcitabine for Injection USP should be monitored closely by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Infusion time and dose frequency: Increased toxicity with infusion time >60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. ( 5.1 ) Hematology: Monitor for myelosuppression, which can be dose-limiting. ( 5.2, 5.7 ) Pulmonary toxicity: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP immediately for severe pulmonary toxicity. ( 5.3 ) Renal: Monitor renal function prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. Use with caution in patients with renal impairment. Cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure, some fatal, have occurred. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP for HUS or severe renal toxicity. ( 5.4 ) Hepatic: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, have occurred. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP for severe hepatic toxicity. ( 5.5 ) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. ( 5.6, 8.1 ) Radiation toxicity. May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Infusion Time Caution - Prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes and more frequent than weekly dosing have been shown to increase toxicity [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. 5.2 Hematology Gemcitabine for Injection USP can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], and myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. 5.3 Pulmonary Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine. In cases of severe lung toxicity, Gemcitabine for Injection USP therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care measures instituted [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Renal Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Gemcitabine for Injection USP should be used with caution in patients with preexisting renal impairment as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.5 Heptic Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Gemcitabine for Injection USP should be used with caution in patients with preexisting hepatic insufficiency as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations. Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a preexisting medical history of hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis may lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.6 Pregnancy Gemcitabine for Injection USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In pre-clinical studies in mice and rabbits, gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Laboratory Tests Patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP should be monitored prior to each dose with a complete blood count (CBC), including differential and platelet count. Suspension or modification of therapy should be considered when marrow suppression is detected [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. Laboratory evaluation of renal and hepatic function should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.8 Radiation Therapy A pattern of tissue injury typically associated with radiation toxicity has been reported in association with concurrent and non-concurrent use of gemcitabine. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) — Analysis of the data does not indicate enhanced toxicity when gemcitabine is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation, other than radiation recall. Data suggest that Gemcitabine for Injection USP can be started after the acute effects of radiation have resolved or at least one week after radiation. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) — Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that gemcitabine has radiosensitizing activity. Toxicity associated with this multimodality therapy is dependent on many different factors, including dose of Gemcitabine for Injection USP, frequency of Gemcitabine for Injection USP administration, dose of radiation, radiotherapy planning technique, the target tissue, and target volume. In a single trial, where gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 was administered concurrently for up to 6 consecutive weeks with therapeutic thoracic radiation to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, significant toxicity in the form of severe, and potentially life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis was observed, particularly in patients receiving large volumes of radiotherapy [median treatment volumes 4795 cm3]. Subsequent studies have been reported and suggest that gemcitabine administered at lower doses with concurrent radiotherapy has predictable and less severe toxicity. However, the optimum regimen for safe administration of Gemcitabine for Injection USP with therapeutic doses of radiation has not yet been determined in all tumor types."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No specific drug interaction studies have been conducted. Information is available on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin, paclitaxel, or carboplatin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 and 12.3)]."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions for the single-agent (>= 20%) are nausea and vomiting, anemia, ALT, AST, neutropenia, leukopenia, alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Medical Affairs at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most adverse reactions are reversible and do not need to result in discontinuation, although doses may need to be withheld or reduced. Gemcitabine has been used in a wide variety of malignancies, both as a single-agent and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Single-Agent Use: Myelosuppression is the principal dose-limiting toxicity with gemcitabine therapy. Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity are frequently needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. The data in Table 4 are based on 979 patients receiving gemcitabine as a single-agent administered weekly as a 30-minute infusion for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. The gemcitabine starting doses ranged from 800 to1250 mg/m2. Data are also shown for the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer treated in 5 clinical studies. The frequency of all grades and severe (WHO Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions were generally similar in the single-agent safety database of 979 patients and the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer. Adverse reactions reported in the single-agent safety database resulted in discontinuation of gemcitabine therapy in about 10% of patients. In the comparative trial in pancreatic cancer, the discontinuation rate for adverse reactions was 14.3% for the gemcitabine arm and 4.8% for the 5-FU arm. All WHO-graded laboratory adverse reactions are listed in Table 4, regardless of causality. Non-laboratory adverse reactions listed in Table 4 or discussed below were those reported, regardless of causality, for at least 10% of all patients, except the categories of Extravasation, Allergic, and Cardiovascular and certain specific adverse reactions under the Renal, Pulmonary, and Infection categories.

For approximately 60% of the patients, non-laboratory adverse reactions were graded only if assessed to be possibly drug-related. Hematologic - In studies in pancreatic cancer myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity with gemcitabine, but <1% of patients discontinued therapy for either anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Red blood cell transfusions were required by 19% of patients. The incidence of sepsis was less than 1%. Petechiae or mild blood loss (hemorrhage), from any cause, was reported in 16% of patients; less than 1% of patients required platelet transfusions. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during gemcitabine therapy and dosage modified or suspended according to the degree of hematologic toxicity. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)] Gastrointestinal - Nausea and vomiting were commonly reported (69%) but were usually of mild to moderate severity. Severe nausea and vomiting (WHO Grade 3/4) occurred in <15% of patients. Diarrhea was reported by 19% of patients, and stomatitis by 11% of patients. Hepatic - In clinical trials, gemcitabine was associated with transient elevations of one or both serum transaminases in approximately 70% of patients, but there was no evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with either longer duration of exposure to gemcitabine or with greater total cumulative dose. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Renal - In clinical trials, mild proteinuria and hematuria were commonly reported. Clinical findings consistent with the Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) were reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%) receiving gemcitabine in clinical trials. Four patients developed HUS on gemcitabine therapy, 2 immediately posttherapy. The diagnosis of HUS should be considered if the patient develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, reticulocytosis, severe thrombocytopenia, and/or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN). Gemcitabine therapy should be discontinued immediately. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy and dialysis may be required. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Fever - The overall incidence of fever was 41%. This is in contrast to the incidence of infection (16%) and indicates that gemcitabine may cause fever in the absence of clinical infection. Fever was frequently associated with other flu-like symptoms and was usually mild and clinically manageable. Rash - Rash was reported in 30% of patients. The rash was typically a macular or finely granular maculopapular pruritic eruption of mild to moderate severity involving the trunk and extremities. Pruritus was reported for 13% of patients. Pulmonary - In clinical trials, dyspnea, unrelated to underlying disease, has been reported in association with gemcitabine therapy. Dyspnea was occasionally accompanied by bronchospasm. Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] The etiology of these effects is unknown. If such effects develop, gemcitabine should be discontinued. Early use of supportive care measures may help ameliorate these conditions. Edema - Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%) were reported. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms - "Flu syndrome" was reported for 19% of patients. Individual symptoms of fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, and myalgia were commonly reported. Fever and asthenia were also reported frequently as isolated symptoms. Insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and malaise were reported infrequently. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to flu-like symptoms. Infection - Infections were reported for 16% of patients. Sepsis was rarely reported (<1%). Alopecia - Hair loss, usually minimal, was reported by 15% of patients. Neurotoxicity - There was a 10% incidence of mild paresthesias and a <1% rate of severe paresthesias. Extravasation - Injection-site related events were reported for 4% of patients. There were no reports of injection site necrosis. Gemcitabine is not a vesicant. Allergic - Bronchospasm was reported for less than 2% of patients. Anaphylactoid reaction has been reported rarely. Gemcitabine should not be administered to patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug [see Contraindications (4)]. Cardiovascular - During clinical trials, 2% of patients discontinued therapy with gemcitabine due to cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension. Many of these patients had a prior history of cardiovascular disease [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Combination Use in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: In the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 35% of gemcitabine injections and 17% of cisplatin injections on the combination arm, versus 6% on the cisplatin-only arm. Dose adjustments were required in greater than 90% of patients on the combination, versus 16% on cisplatin. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients on the combination arm and 8% of patients on the cisplatin arm.With a median of 4 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment, 94 of 262 patients (36%) experienced a total of 149 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions.With a median of 2 cycles of cisplatin treatment, 61 of 260 patients (23%) experienced 78 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 20% of gemcitabine injections and 16% of cisplatin injections in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared with 20% of etoposide injections and 15% of cisplatin injections in the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. With a median of 5 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment, 15 of 69 patients (22%) experienced 15 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 4 cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin treatment, 18 of 66 patients (27%) experienced 22 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In patients who completed more than one cycle, dose adjustments were reported in 81% of the gemcitabine plus cisplatin patients, compared with 68% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 14% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm and in 8% of patients on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The incidence of myelosuppression was increased in frequency with gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment (~90%) compared to that with the gemcitabine monotherapy (~60%). With combination therapy gemcitabine dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity were required more often while cisplatin dose adjustments were less frequently required. Table 5 presents the safety data from the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study in non-small cell lung cancer. The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) were used. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm. Nine cases of febrile neutropenia were reported on the combination therapy arm compared to 2 on the cisplatin arm. More patients required RBC and platelet transfusions on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. Myelosuppression occurred more frequently on the combination arm, and in 4 possibly treatment-related deaths myelosuppression was observed. Sepsis was reported in 4% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to 1% on the cisplatin arm. Platelet transfusions were required in 21% of patients on the combination arm and <1% of patients on the cisplatin arm. Hemorrhagic events occurred in 14% of patients on the combination arm and 4% on the cisplatin arm. However, severe hemorrhagic events were rare. Red blood cell transfusions were required in 39% of the patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, versus 13% on the cisplatin arm. The data suggest cumulative anemia with continued gemcitabine plus cisplatin use. Nausea and vomiting despite the use of antiemetics occurred more often with gemcitabine plus cisplatin therapy (78%) than with cisplatin alone (71%). In studies with single-agent gemcitabine, a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting (58% to 69%) was reported. Renal function abnormalities, hypomagnesemia, neuromotor, neurocortical, and neurocerebellar toxicity occurred more often with gemcitabine plus cisplatin than with cisplatin monotherapy. Neurohearing toxicity was similar on both arms. Cardiac dysrrhythmias of Grade 3 or greater were reported in 7 (3%) patients treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin compared to one (<1%) Grade 3 dysrrhythmia reported with cisplatin therapy. Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia were associated with one Grade 4 arrhythmia on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination arm. Table 6 presents data from the randomized study of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin in 135 patients with NSCLC. One death (1.5%) was reported on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm due to febrile neutropenia associated with renal failure which was possibly treatment-related. No deaths related to treatment occurred on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The overall incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm was less than on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm (28% versus 56%). Sepsis was experienced by 2% of patients on both treatment arms. Grade 3 anemia and Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia were more common on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. RBC transfusions were given to 29% of the patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus 21% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Platelet transfusions were given to 3% of the patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus 8% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting were also more common on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. On the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, 7% of participants were hospitalized due to febrile neutropenia compared to 12% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. More than twice as many patients had dose reductions or omissions of a scheduled dose of gemcitabine as compared to etoposide, which may explain the differences in the incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia between treatment arms. Flu syndrome was reported by 3% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm with none reported on the comparator arm. Eight patients (12%) on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm reported edema compared to one patient (2%) on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm.

Combination Use in Breast Cancer: In the gemcitabine plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel study, dose reductions occurred with 8% of gemcitabine injections and 5% of paclitaxel injections on the combination arm, versus 2% on the paclitaxel arm. On the combination arm, 7% of gemcitabine doses were omitted and <1% of paclitaxel doses were omitted, compared to <1% of paclitaxel doses on the paclitaxel arm. A total of 18 patients (7%) on the gemcitabine plus paclitaxel arm and 12 (5%) on the paclitaxel arm discontinued the study because of adverse reactions. There were two deaths on study or within 30 days after study drug discontinuation that were possibly drug-related, one on each arm. Table 7 presents the safety data occurrences of >= 10% (all grades) from the gemcitabine plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel study in breast cancer.

Combination Use in Ovarian Cancer: In the gemcitabine for injection plus carboplatin versus carboplatin study, dose reductions occurred with 10.4% of gemcitabine for injection and 1.8% of carboplatin injections on the combination arm, versus 3.8% on the carboplatin alone arm. On the combination arm, 13.7% of gemcitabine for injection doses were omitted and 0.2% of carboplatin doses were omitted, compared to 0% of carboplatin doses on the carboplatin alone arm. There were no differences in discontinuations due to adverse reactions between arms (10.9% versus 9.8%, respectively). Table 8 presents the adverse reactions (all grades) occurring in >=10% of patients in the ovarian cancer study.

Transfusions are not CTC-graded events. Blood transfusions included both packed red blood cells and whole blood. In addition to blood product transfusions as listed in Table 8, myelosuppression was also managed with hematopoietic agents. These agents were administered more frequently with combination therapy than with monotherapy (granulocyte growth factors: 23.6% and 10.1%, respectively; erythropoietic agents: 7.3% and 3.9%, respectively). The following are the clinically relevant adverse reactions, regardless of causality, that occurred in >1% and <10% (all grades) of patients on either arm. In parentheses are the incidences of Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions (gemcitabine plus carboplatin versus carboplatin): AST or ALT elevation (0 versus 1.2%), dyspnea (3.4% versus 2.9%), febrile neutropenia (1.1% versus 0), hemorrhagic event (2.3% versus 1.1%), hypersensitivity reaction (2.3% versus 2.9%), motor neuropathy (1.1% versus 0.6%), and rash/desquamation (0.6% versus 0). No differences in the incidence of laboratory and non-laboratory events were observed in patients 65 years or older, as compared to patients younger than 65. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of gemcitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions have occurred after gemcitabine single-agent use and gemcitabine in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Decisions to include these events are based on the seriousness of the event, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to gemcitabine. Cardiovascular - Congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction have been reported very rarely with the use of gemcitabine. Arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular in nature, have been reported very rarely. Vascular Disorders - Clinical signs of peripheral vasculitis and gangrene have been reported very rarely. Skin - Cellulitis and non-serious injection site reactions in the absence of extravasation have been rarely reported. Severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions, have been reported very rarely. Hepatic - Increased liver function tests including elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels have been reported rarely. Serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure and death has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease has been reported. Pulmonary - Parenchymal toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported rarely following one or more doses of gemcitabine administered to patients with various malignancies. Some patients experienced the onset of pulmonary symptoms up to 2 weeks after the last gemcitabine dose. Respiratory failure and death occurred very rarely in some patients despite discontinuation of therapy. Renal - Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been rarely reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS. Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications - Radiation recall reactions have been reported. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients receiving therapy with gemcitabine should be monitored closely by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Infusion time and dose frequency: Increased toxicity with infusion time >60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Hematology: Monitor for myelosuppression, which can be dose-limiting. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary toxicity: Discontinue gemcitabine immediately for severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Renal: Monitor renal function prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. Use with caution in patients with renal impairment. Cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure, some fatal, have occurred. Discontinue gemcitabine for HUS or severe renal toxicity. (5.4) Hepatic: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, have occurred. Discontinue gemcitabine for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Radiation toxicity. May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity. (5.8) 5.1 Infusion time Caution - Prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes and more frequent than weekly dosing have been shown to increase toxicity [see Clinical Studies (14.5 ) ]. 5.2 Hematology Gemcitabine can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], and myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy [see Dosage and Administration(2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. 5.3 Pulmonary Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine. In cases of severe lung toxicity, gemcitabine therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care measures instituted [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Renal Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)].Gemcitabine should be used with caution in patients with preexisting renal impairment as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.5 Hepatic Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)].Gemcitabine should be used with caution in patients with preexisting hepatic insufficiency as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations. Administration of gemcitabine in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a preexisting medical history of hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis may lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.6 Pregnancy Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In pre-clinical studies in mice and rabbits, gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of gemcitabine in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Laboratory Tests Patients receiving gemcitabine should be monitored prior to each dose with a complete blood count (CBC), including differential and platelet count. Suspension or modification of therapy should be considered when marrow suppression is detected [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. Laboratory evaluation of renal and hepatic function should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.8 Radiation Therapy A pattern of tissue injury typically associated with radiation toxicity has been reported in association with concurrent and non-concurrent use of gemcitabine. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) - Analysis of the data does not indicate enhanced toxicity when gemcitabine is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation, other than radiation recall. Data suggest that gemcitabine can be started after the acute effects of radiation have resolved or at least one week after radiation. Concurrent (given together or <= 7 days apart) - Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that gemcitabine for injection has radiosensitizing activity. Toxicity associated with this multimodality therapy is dependent on many different factors, including dose of gemcitabine frequency of gemcitabine administration, dose of radiation, radiotherapy planning technique, the target tissue, and target volume. In a single trial, where gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 was administered concurrently for up to 6 consecutive weeks with therapeutic thoracic radiation to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, significant toxicity in the form of severe, and potentially life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis was observed, particularly in patients receiving large volumes of radiotherapy [median treatment volumes 4795 cm3]. Subsequent studies have been reported and suggest that gemcitabine administered at lower doses with concurrent radiotherapy has predictable and less severe toxicity. However, the optimum regimen for safe administration of gemcitabine with therapeutic doses of radiation has not yet been determined in all tumor types."

Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (>=20%) adverse reactions of single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (>=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection across 5 clinical trials. Table 5 includes all clinical adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of Gemcitabine for Injection-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients randomized to Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly.(5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression.(5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity.(5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection for HUS or severe renal impairment.(5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus.(5.6, 8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy.(5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection. (5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine for Injection, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of Gemcitabine for Injection is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent and the risks are increased when Gemcitabine for Injection is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemcitabine for Injection. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome to include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine for Injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) — Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which Gemcitabine for Injection was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) — Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemcitabine for Injection is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemcitabine for Injection after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection if PRES develops during therapy."

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in another section of the label Schedule-Dependent Toxicity[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Myelosuppression[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hepatic Toxicity[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Embryo-fetal Toxicity[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] Exacerbation of Radiation Toxicity[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Capillary Leak Syndrome[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (greater than or equal to 20%) adverse reactions of single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection USP are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (greater than or equal to 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection USP due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection USP across 5 clinical trials.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients randomized to gemcitabine plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (greater than 90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus less than 1%) were all higher in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment- related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table. Patients in the gemcitabine cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for treatment-related adverse events was 22% (GC) and 27% in the (EC) arm. The proportion of discontinuation of treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions was higher for patients in the (GC) arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the (GC) arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the gemcitabine/cisplatin arm.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue gemcitabine immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6,8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days ofradiation therapy. (5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue gemcitabine. (5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue gemcitabine. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine for Injection USP, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of gemcitabine is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with gemcitabine as a single agent and the risks are increased when gemcitabine is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent. The frequencies of Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemcitabine for Injection USP. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome to include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection USP. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN)[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1and 6.2)]. Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection USP and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine for Injection USP, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection USP is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or less than or equal to 7 days apart)— Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which Gemcitabine for Injection USP was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given greater than 7 days apart)— Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemcitabine for Injection USP is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemcitabine for Injection USP after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection USP as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection USP if PRES develops during therapy."

Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to gemcitabine as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (>=20%) adverse reactions of single-agent gemcitabine are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (>=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued gemcitabine due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent gemcitabine across 5 clinical trials. Table 5 includes all clinical adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [ see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . Patients randomized to gemcitabine plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table. Patients in the gemcitabine cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for treatment-related adverse events was 22% (GC) and 27% in the (EC) arm. The proportion of discontinuation of treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions was higher for patients in the (GC) arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the (GC) arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the gemcitabine/cisplatin arm.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular - Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias Vascular Disorders - Peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, and capillary leak syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Skin - Cellulitis, severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions Hepatic - Hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease Pulmonary - Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Nervous System - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [see Warnings and Precautions 5.9 ]",
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) -Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) -Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) -Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) -Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) -Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) -Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (5.7) -Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP. (5.8) -Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of Gemcitabine for Injection, USP is influenced by the length of the infusion [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with Gemcitabine as a single agent and the risks are increased when Gemcitabine is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent Gemcitabine. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemcitabine. Discontinue gemcitabine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 ) ]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic uremic syndrome, including fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with gemcitabine. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 ) ] . Assess renal function prior to initiation of gemcitabine and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Permanently discontinue gemcitabine in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 ) ] . Administration of gemcitabine in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of gemcitabine and periodically during treatment. Discontinue gemcitabine in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking gemcitabine, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) - Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) - Excessive toxicity has not been observed when gemcitabine is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive gemcitabine after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue gemcitabine if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue gemcitabine if PRES develops during therapy.",

The most common adverse reactions for the single-agent (>=20%) are nausea and vomiting, anemia, ALT, AST, neutropenia, leukopenia, alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100 or electronically at ProductComplaintsPP@hospira.com, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most adverse reactions are reversible and do not need to result in discontinuation, although doses may need to be withheld or reduced. Gemcitabine has been used in a wide variety of malignancies, both as a single-agent and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Single-Agent Use Myelosuppression is the principal dose-limiting toxicity with gemcitabine therapy. Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity are frequently needed [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. The data in Table 4 are based on 979 patients receiving gemcitabine as a single-agent administered weekly as a 30-minute infusion for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. The gemcitabine starting doses ranged from 800 to 1250 mg/m2. Data are also shown for the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer treated in 5 clinical studies. The frequency of all grades and severe (WHO Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions were generally similar in the single-agent safety database of 979 patients and the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer. Adverse reactions reported in the single-agent safety database resulted in discontinuation of gemcitabine therapy in about 10% of patients. In the comparative trial in pancreatic cancer, the discontinuation rate for adverse reactions was 14.3% for the gemcitabine arm and 4.8% for the 5-FU arm. All WHO-graded laboratory adverse reactions are listed in Table 4, regardless of causality. Non-laboratory adverse reactions listed in Table 4 or discussed below were those reported, regardless of causality, for at least 10% of all patients, except the categories of Extravasation, Allergic, and Cardiovascular and certain specific adverse reactions under the Renal, Pulmonary, and Infection categories.

Red blood cell transfusions were required by 19% of patients. The incidence of sepsis was less than 1%. Petechiae or mild blood loss (hemorrhage), from any cause, was reported in 16% of patients; less than 1% of patients required platelet transfusions. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during gemcitabine therapy and dosage modified or suspended according to the degree of hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)] . Gastrointestinal - Nausea and vomiting were commonly reported (69%) but were usually of mild to moderate severity. Severe nausea and vomiting (WHO Grade 3/4) occurred in <15% of patients. Diarrhea was reported by 19% of patients, and stomatitis by 11% of patients. Hepatic - In clinical trials, gemcitabine was associated with transient elevations of one or both serum transaminases in approximately 70% of patients, but there was no evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with either longer duration of exposure to gemcitabine or with greater total cumulative dose. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Renal - In clinical trials, mild proteinuria and hematuria were commonly reported. Clinical findings consistent with the Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) were reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%) receiving gemcitabine in clinical trials. Four patients developed HUS on gemcitabine therapy, 2 immediately posttherapy. The diagnosis of HUS should be considered if the patient develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, reticulocytosis, severe thrombocytopenia, and/or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN). Gemcitabine therapy should be discontinued immediately. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy and dialysis may be required [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Fever - The overall incidence of fever was 41%. This is in contrast to the incidence of infection (16%) and indicates that gemcitabine may cause fever in the absence of clinical infection. Fever was frequently associated with other flu-like symptoms and was usually mild and clinically manageable. Rash - Rash was reported in 30% of patients. The rash was typically a macular or finely granular maculopapular pruritic eruption of mild to moderate severity involving the trunk and extremities. Pruritus was reported for 13% of patients. Pulmonary - In clinical trials, dyspnea, unrelated to underlying disease, has been reported in association with gemcitabine therapy. Dyspnea was occasionally accompanied by bronchospasm. Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . The etiology of these effects is unknown. If such effects develop, gemcitabine should be discontinued. Early use of supportive care measures may help ameliorate these conditions. Edema - Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%) were reported. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms - "Flu syndrome" was reported for 19% of patients. Individual symptoms of fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, and myalgia were commonly reported. Fever and asthenia were also reported frequently as isolated symptoms. Insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and malaise were reported infrequently. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to flu-like symptoms. Infection - Infections were reported for 16% of patients. Sepsis was rarely reported (<1%). Alopecia - Hair loss, usually minimal, was reported by 15% of patients. Neurotoxicity - There was a 10% incidence of mild paresthesias and a <1% rate of severe paresthesias. Extravasation - Injection-site related events were reported for 4% of patients. There were no reports of injection site necrosis. Gemcitabine is not a vesicant. Allergic - Bronchospasm was reported for less than 2% of patients. Anaphylactoid reaction has been reported rarely. Gemcitabine should not be administered to patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Cardiovascular - During clinical trials, 2% of patients discontinued therapy with gemcitabine due to cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension. Many of these patients had a prior history of cardiovascular disease [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Combination Use in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer In the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 35% of gemcitabine injections and 17% of cisplatin injections on the combination arm, versus 6% on the cisplatin-only arm. Dose adjustments were required in greater than 90% of patients on the combination, versus 16% on cisplatin. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients on the combination arm and 8% of patients on the cisplatin arm. With a median of 4 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment, 94 of 262 patients (36%) experienced a total of 149 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 2 cycles of cisplatin treatment, 61 of 260 patients (23%) experienced 78 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 20% of gemcitabine injections and 16% of cisplatin injections in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared with 20% of etoposide injections and 15% of cisplatin injections in the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. With a median of 5 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment, 15 of 69 patients (22%) experienced 15 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 4 cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin treatment, 18 of 66 patients (27%) experienced 22 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In patients who completed more than one cycle, dose adjustments were reported in 81% of the gemcitabine plus cisplatin patients, compared with 68% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 14% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm and in 8% of patients on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The incidence of myelosuppression was increased in frequency with gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment (~90%) compared to that with the gemcitabine monotherapy (~60%). With combination therapy gemcitabine dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity were required more often while cisplatin dose adjustments were less frequently required. Table 5 presents the safety data from the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study in non-small cell lung cancer. The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) were used. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm. Nine cases of febrile neutropenia were reported on the combination therapy arm compared to 2 on the cisplatin arm. More patients required RBC and platelet transfusions on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. Myelosuppression occurred more frequently on the combination arm, and in 4 possibly treatment-related deaths myelosuppression was observed. Sepsis was reported in 4% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to 1% on the cisplatin arm. Platelet transfusions were required in 21% of patients on the combination arm and <1% of patients on the cisplatin arm. Hemorrhagic events occurred in 14% of patients on the combination arm and 4% on the cisplatin arm. However, severe hemorrhagic events were rare. Red blood cell transfusions were required in 39% of the patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, versus 13% on the cisplatin arm. The data suggest cumulative anemia with continued gemcitabine plus cisplatin use. Nausea and vomiting despite the use of antiemetics occurred more often with gemcitabine plus cisplatin therapy (78%) than with cisplatin alone (71%). In studies with single-agent gemcitabine, a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting (58% to 69%) was reported. Renal function abnormalities, hypomagnesemia, neuromotor, neurocortical, and neurocerebellar toxicity occurred more often with gemcitabine plus cisplatin than with cisplatin monotherapy. Neurohearing toxicity was similar on both arms. Cardiac dysrrhythmias of Grade 3 or greater were reported in 7 (3%) patients treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin compared to one (<1%) Grade 3 dysrrhythmia reported with cisplatin therapy. Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia were associated with one Grade 4 arrhythmia on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination arm. Table 6 presents data from the randomized study of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin in 135 patients with NSCLC. One death (1.5%) was reported on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm due to febrile neutropenia associated with renal failure which was possibly treatment-related. No deaths related to treatment occurred on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The overall incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm was less than on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm (28% versus 56%). Sepsis was experienced by 2% of patients on both treatment arms. Grade 3 anemia and Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia were more common on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. RBC transfusions were given to 29% of the patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus 21% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Platelet transfusions were given to 3% of the patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus 8% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting were also more common on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. On the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, 7% of participants were hospitalized due to febrile neutropenia compared to 12% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. More than twice as many patients had dose reductions or omissions of a scheduled dose of gemcitabine as compared to etoposide, which may explain the differences in the incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia between treatment arms. Flu syndrome was reported by 3% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm with none reported on the comparator arm. Eight patients (12%) on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm reported edema compared to one patient (2%) on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm.

On the combination arm, 7% of gemcitabine doses were omitted and <1% of paclitaxel doses were omitted, compared to <1% of paclitaxel doses on the paclitaxel arm. A total of 18 patients (7%) on the gemcitabine plus paclitaxel arm and 12 (5%) on the paclitaxel arm discontinued the study because of adverse reactions. There were two deaths on study or within 30 days after study drug discontinuation that were possibly drug-related, one on each arm.

No differences in the incidence of laboratory and non-laboratory events were observed in patients 65 years or older, as compared to patients younger than 65. Combination Use in Ovarian Cancer In the gemcitabine plus carboplatin versus carboplatin study, dose reductions occurred with 10.4% of gemcitabine injections and 1.8% of carboplatin injections on the combination arm, versus 3.8% on the carboplatin alone arm. On the combination arm, 13.7% of gemcitabine doses were omitted and 0.2% of carboplatin doses were omitted, compared to 0% of carboplatin doses on the carboplatin alone arm. There were no differences in discontinuations due to adverse reactions between arms (10.9% versus 9.8%, respectively).

These agents were administered more frequently with combination therapy than with monotherapy (granulocyte growth factors: 23.6% and 10.1%, respectively; erythropoietic agents: 7.3% and 3.9%, respectively). The following are the clinically relevant adverse reactions, regardless of causality, that occurred in >1% and <10% (all grades) of patients on either arm. In parentheses are the incidences of Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions (gemcitabine plus carboplatin versus carboplatin): AST or ALT elevation (0 versus 1.2%), dyspnea (3.4% versus 2.9%), febrile neutropenia (1.1% versus 0), hemorrhagic event (2.3% versus 1.1%), hypersensitivity reaction (2.3% versus 2.9%), motor neuropathy (1.1% versus 0.6%), and rash/desquamation (0.6% versus 0). No differences in the incidence of laboratory and non-laboratory events were observed in patients 65 years or older, as compared to patients younger than 65. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of gemcitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions have occurred after gemcitabine single-agent use and gemcitabine in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Decisions to include these events are based on the seriousness of the event, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to gemcitabine. Nervous System - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. Cardiovascular - Congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction have been reported very rarely with the use of gemcitabine. Arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular in nature, have been reported very rarely. Vascular Disorders - Clinical signs of peripheral vasculitis and gangrene have been reported very rarely. Skin - Cellulitis and non-serious injection site reactions in the absence of extravasation have been rarely reported. Severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions, have been reported very rarely. Hepatic - Increased liver function tests including elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels have been reported rarely. Serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure and death has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease has been reported. Pulmonary - Parenchymal toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported rarely following one or more doses of gemcitabine administered to patients with various malignancies. Some patients experienced the onset of pulmonary symptoms up to 2 weeks after the last gemcitabine dose. Respiratory failure and death occurred very rarely in some patients despite discontinuation of therapy. Renal - Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been rarely reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS. Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications - Radiation recall reactions have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] .",

Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) -Radiation toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity. (5.8) -Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection. (5.9) -Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome. (5.10) 5.1 Infusion Time Caution - Prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes and more frequent than weekly dosing have been shown to increase toxicity [ see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. 5.2 Hematology Gemcitabine can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ], and myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. 5.3 Pulmonary Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine. In cases of severe lung toxicity, Gemcitabine Injection therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care measures instituted [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Renal Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)] . Gemcitabine Injection should be used with caution in patients with preexisting renal impairment as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.5 Hepatic Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)] . Gemcitabine Injection should be used with caution in patients with preexisting hepatic insufficiency as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations. Administration of Gemcitabine Injection in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a preexisting medical history of hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis may lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 5.6 Pregnancy Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In pre-clinical studies in mice and rabbits, gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of gemcitabine in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.7 Laboratory Tests Patients receiving Gemcitabine Injection should be monitored prior to each dose with a complete blood count (CBC), including differential and platelet count. Suspension or modification of therapy should be considered when marrow suppression is detected [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)] . Laboratory evaluation of renal and hepatic function should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.8 Radiation Therapy A pattern of tissue injury typically associated with radiation toxicity has been reported in association with concurrent and non-concurrent use of gemcitabine. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) - Analysis of the data does not indicate enhanced toxicity when gemcitabine is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation, other than radiation recall. Data suggest that gemcitabine can be started after the acute effects of radiation have resolved or at least one week after radiation. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) - Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that gemcitabine has radiosensitizing activity. Toxicity associated with this multimodality therapy is dependent on many different factors, including dose of gemcitabine, frequency of gemcitabine administration, dose of radiation, radiotherapy planning technique, the target tissue, and target volume. In a single trial, where gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 was administered concurrently for up to 6 consecutive weeks with therapeutic thoracic radiation to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, significant toxicity in the form of severe, and potentially life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis was observed, particularly in patients receiving large volumes of radiotherapy [median treatment volumes 4795 cm3]. Subsequent studies have been reported and suggest that gemcitabine administered at lower doses with concurrent radiotherapy has predictable and less severe toxicity. However, the optimum regimen for safe administration of gemcitabine with therapeutic doses of radiation has not yet been determined in all tumor types. 5.9 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue gemcitabine if CLS develops during therapy. 5.10 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue gemcitabine if PRES develops during therapy.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in another section of the label -Schedule-Dependent Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] -Myelosuppression [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] -Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] -Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] -Hepatic Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] -Embryo-fetal Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] -Exacerbation of Radiation Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] -Capillary Leak Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] -Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. The most common adverse reactions for the single-agent (>=20%) are nausea and vomiting, anemia, ALT, AST, neutropenia, leukopenia, alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100 or electronically at ProductComplaintsPP@hospira.com, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most adverse reactions are reversible and do not need to result in discontinuation, although doses may need to be withheld or reduced. Gemcitabine has been used in a wide variety of malignancies, both as a single-agent and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Single-Agent Use Myelosuppression is the principal dose-limiting toxicity with gemcitabine therapy. Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity are frequently needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4)]. The data in Table 4 are based on 979 patients receiving gemcitabine as a single-agent administered weekly as a 30-minute infusion for treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. The gemcitabine starting doses ranged from 800 to 1250 mg/m2. Data are also shown for the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer treated in 5 clinical studies. The frequency of all grades and severe (WHO Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions were generally similar in the single-agent safety database of 979 patients and the subset of patients with pancreatic cancer. Adverse reactions reported in the single-agent safety database resulted in discontinuation of gemcitabine therapy in about 10% of patients. In the comparative trial in pancreatic cancer, the discontinuation rate for adverse reactions was 14.3% for the gemcitabine arm and 4.8% for the 5-FU arm. All WHO-graded laboratory adverse reactions are listed in Table 4, regardless of causality. Non-laboratory adverse reactions listed in Table 4 or discussed below were those reported, regardless of causality, for at least 10% of all patients, except the categories of Extravasation, Allergic, and Cardiovascular and certain specific adverse reactions under the Renal, Pulmonary, and Infection categories.

Red blood cell transfusions were required by 19% of patients. The incidence of sepsis was less than 1%. Petechiae or mild blood loss (hemorrhage), from any cause, was reported in 16% of patients; less than 1% of patients required platelet transfusions. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during gemcitabine therapy and dosage modified or suspended according to the degree of hematologic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , and 2.4 ) ] . Gastrointestinal - Nausea and vomiting were commonly reported (69%) but were usually of mild to moderate severity. Severe nausea and vomiting (WHO Grade 3/4) occurred in <15% of patients. Diarrhea was reported by 19% of patients, and stomatitis by 11% of patients. Hepatic - In clinical trials, gemcitabine was associated with transient elevations of one or both serum transaminases in approximately 70% of patients, but there was no evidence of increasing hepatic toxicity with either longer duration of exposure to gemcitabine or with greater total cumulative dose. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Renal - In clinical trials, mild proteinuria and hematuria were commonly reported. Clinical findings consistent with the Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) were reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%) receiving gemcitabine in clinical trials. Four patients developed HUS on gemcitabine therapy, 2 immediately posttherapy. The diagnosis of HUS should be considered if the patient develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, reticulocytosis, severe thrombocytopenia, and/or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN). Gemcitabine therapy should be discontinued immediately. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy and dialysis may be required [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Fever - The overall incidence of fever was 41%. This is in contrast to the incidence of infection (16%) and indicates that gemcitabine may cause fever in the absence of clinical infection. Fever was frequently associated with other flu-like symptoms and was usually mild and clinically manageable. Rash - Rash was reported in 30% of patients. The rash was typically a macular or finely granular maculopapular pruritic eruption of mild to moderate severity involving the trunk and extremities. Pruritus was reported for 13% of patients. Pulmonary - In clinical trials, dyspnea, unrelated to underlying disease, has been reported in association with gemcitabine therapy. Dyspnea was occasionally accompanied by bronchospasm. Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . The etiology of these effects is unknown. If such effects develop, gemcitabine should be discontinued. Early use of supportive care measures may help ameliorate these conditions. Edema - Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%) were reported. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms - "Flu syndrome" was reported for 19% of patients. Individual symptoms of fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, and myalgia were commonly reported. Fever and asthenia were also reported frequently as isolated symptoms. Insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and malaise were reported infrequently. Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to flu-like symptoms. Infection - Infections were reported for 16% of patients. Sepsis was rarely reported (<1%). Alopecia - Hair loss, usually minimal, was reported by 15% of patients. Neurotoxicity - There was a 10% incidence of mild paresthesias and a <1% rate of severe paresthesias. Extravasation - Injection-site related events were reported for 4% of patients. There were no reports of injection site necrosis. Gemcitabine is not a vesicant. Allergic - Bronchospasm was reported for less than 2% of patients. Anaphylactoid reaction has been reported rarely. Gemcitabine should not be administered to patients with a known hypersensitivity to this drug [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Cardiovascular - During clinical trials, 2% of patients discontinued therapy with gemcitabine due to cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension. Many of these patients had a prior history of cardiovascular disease [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Combination Use in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer In the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 35% of gemcitabine injections and 17% of cisplatin injections on the combination arm, versus 6% on the cisplatin-only arm. Dose adjustments were required in greater than 90% of patients on the combination, versus 16% on cisplatin. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients on the combination arm and 8% of patients on the cisplatin arm. With a median of 4 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment, 94 of 262 patients (36%) experienced a total of 149 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 2 cycles of cisplatin treatment, 61 of 260 patients (23%) experienced 78 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin study, dose adjustments occurred with 20% of gemcitabine injections and 16% of cisplatin injections in the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared with 20% of etoposide injections and 15% of cisplatin injections in the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. With a median of 5 cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment, 15 of 69 patients (22%) experienced 15 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. With a median of 4 cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin treatment, 18 of 66 patients (27%) experienced 22 hospitalizations due to possibly treatment-related adverse reactions. In patients who completed more than one cycle, dose adjustments were reported in 81% of the gemcitabine plus cisplatin patients, compared with 68% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. Study discontinuations for possibly drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 14% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm and in 8% of patients on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The incidence of myelosuppression was increased in frequency with gemcitabine plus cisplatin treatment (~90%) compared to that with the gemcitabine monotherapy (~60%). With combination therapy gemcitabine dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity were required more often while cisplatin dose adjustments were less frequently required. Table 5 presents the safety data from the gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin study in non-small cell lung cancer. The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) were used. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm. Nine cases of febrile neutropenia were reported on the combination therapy arm compared to 2 on the cisplatin arm. More patients required RBC and platelet transfusions on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. Myelosuppression occurred more frequently on the combination arm, and in 4 possibly treatment-related deaths myelosuppression was observed. Sepsis was reported in 4% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm compared to 1% on the cisplatin arm. Platelet transfusions were required in 21% of patients on the combination arm and <1% of patients on the cisplatin arm. Hemorrhagic events occurred in 14% of patients on the combination arm and 4% on the cisplatin arm. However, severe hemorrhagic events were rare. Red blood cell transfusions were required in 39% of the patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, versus 13% on the cisplatin arm. The data suggest cumulative anemia with continued gemcitabine plus cisplatin use. Nausea and vomiting despite the use of antiemetics occurred more often with gemcitabine plus cisplatin therapy (78%) than with cisplatin alone (71%). In studies with single-agent gemcitabine, a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting (58% to 69%) was reported. Renal function abnormalities, hypomagnesemia, neuromotor, neurocortical, and neurocerebellar toxicity occurred more often with gemcitabine plus cisplatin than with cisplatin monotherapy. Neurohearing toxicity was similar on both arms. Cardiac dysrrhythmias of Grade 3 or greater were reported in 7 (3%) patients treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin compared to one (<1%) Grade 3 dysrrhythmia reported with cisplatin therapy. Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia were associated with one Grade 4 arrhythmia on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination arm. Table 6 presents data from the randomized study of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus etoposide plus cisplatin in 135 patients with NSCLC. One death (1.5%) was reported on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm due to febrile neutropenia associated with renal failure which was possibly treatment-related. No deaths related to treatment occurred on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. The overall incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm was less than on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm (28% versus 56%). Sepsis was experienced by 2% of patients on both treatment arms. Grade 3 anemia and Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia were more common on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. RBC transfusions were given to 29% of the patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus 21% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Platelet transfusions were given to 3% of the patients who received gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus 8% of patients who received etoposide plus cisplatin. Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting were also more common on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm. On the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm, 7% of participants were hospitalized due to febrile neutropenia compared to 12% on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm. More than twice as many patients had dose reductions or omissions of a scheduled dose of gemcitabine as compared to etoposide, which may explain the differences in the incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia between treatment arms. Flu syndrome was reported by 3% of patients on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm with none reported on the comparator arm. Eight patients (12%) on the gemcitabine plus cisplatin arm reported edema compared to one patient (2%) on the etoposide plus cisplatin arm.

These agents were administered more frequently with combination therapy than with monotherapy (granulocyte growth factors: 23.6% and 10.1%, respectively; erythropoietic agents: 7.3% and 3.9%, respectively). The following are the clinically relevant adverse reactions, regardless of causality, that occurred in >1% and <10% (all grades) of patients on either arm. In parentheses are the incidences of Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions (gemcitabine plus carboplatin versus carboplatin): AST or ALT elevation (0 versus 1.2%), dyspnea (3.4% versus 2.9%), febrile neutropenia (1.1% versus 0), hemorrhagic event (2.3% versus 1.1%), hypersensitivity reaction (2.3% versus 2.9%), motor neuropathy (1.1% versus 0.6%), and rash/desquamation (0.6% versus 0). No differences in the incidence of laboratory and non-laboratory events were observed in patients 65 years or older, as compared to patients younger than 65. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of gemcitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions have occurred after gemcitabine single-agent use and gemcitabine in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Decisions to include these events are based on the seriousness of the event, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to gemcitabine. Nervous System - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. Cardiovascular - Congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction have been reported very rarely with the use of gemcitabine. Arrhythmias, predominantly supraventricular in nature, have been reported very rarely. Vascular Disorders - Clinical signs of peripheral vasculitis and gangrene have been reported very rarely. Skin - Cellulitis and non-serious injection site reactions in the absence of extravasation have been rarely reported. Severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions, have been reported very rarely. Hepatic - Increased liver function tests including elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels have been reported rarely. Serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure and death has been reported very rarely in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease has been reported. Pulmonary - Parenchymal toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported rarely following one or more doses of gemcitabine administered to patients with various malignancies. Some patients experienced the onset of pulmonary symptoms up to 2 weeks after the last gemcitabine dose. Respiratory failure and death occurred very rarely in some patients despite discontinuation of therapy. Renal - Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been rarely reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS. Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications - Radiation recall reactions have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] ."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients receiving therapy with Gemcitabine Injection should be monitored closely by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. -Infusion time and dose frequency: Increased toxicity with infusion time >60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) -Hematology: Monitor for myelosuppression, which can be dose-limiting. (5.2, 5.7) -Pulmonary toxicity: Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection immediately for severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) -Renal: Monitor renal function prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. Use with caution in patients with renal impairment. Cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure, some fatal, have occurred. Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection for HUS or severe renal toxicity. (5.4) -Hepatic: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter. Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, have occurred. Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) -Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) -Radiation toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity. (5.8) -Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemcitabine Injection. (5.9) -Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome. (5.10) 5.1 Infusion Time Caution - Prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes and more frequent than weekly dosing have been shown to increase toxicity [ see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. 5.2 Hematology Gemcitabine can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ], and myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , and 2.4 ) ]. 5.3 Pulmonary Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine. In cases of severe lung toxicity, Gemcitabine Injection therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care measures instituted [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 ) ]. 5.4 Renal Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of gemcitabine. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 ) ] . Gemcitabine Injection should be used with caution in patients with preexisting renal impairment as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 5.5 Hepatic Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 ) ] . Gemcitabine Injection should be used with caution in patients with preexisting hepatic insufficiency as there is insufficient information from clinical studies to allow clear dose recommendation for these patient populations. Administration of Gemcitabine Injection in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a preexisting medical history of hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis may lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 5.6 Pregnancy Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In pre-clinical studies in mice and rabbits, gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of gemcitabine in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Use In Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.7 Laboratory Tests Patients receiving Gemcitabine Injection should be monitored prior to each dose with a complete blood count (CBC), including differential and platelet count. Suspension or modification of therapy should be considered when marrow suppression is detected [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , and 2.4 ) ] . Laboratory evaluation of renal and hepatic function should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.8 Radiation Therapy A pattern of tissue injury typically associated with radiation toxicity has been reported in association with concurrent and non-concurrent use of gemcitabine. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) - Analysis of the data does not indicate enhanced toxicity when gemcitabine is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation, other than radiation recall. Data suggest that gemcitabine can be started after the acute effects of radiation have resolved or at least one week after radiation. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) - Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that gemcitabine has radiosensitizing activity. Toxicity associated with this multimodality therapy is dependent on many different factors, including dose of gemcitabine, frequency of gemcitabine administration, dose of radiation, radiotherapy planning technique, the target tissue, and target volume. In a single trial, where gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 was administered concurrently for up to 6 consecutive weeks with therapeutic thoracic radiation to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, significant toxicity in the form of severe, and potentially life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis was observed, particularly in patients receiving large volumes of radiotherapy [median treatment volumes 4795 cm3]. Subsequent studies have been reported and suggest that gemcitabine administered at lower doses with concurrent radiotherapy has predictable and less severe toxicity. However, the optimum regimen for safe administration of gemcitabine with therapeutic doses of radiation has not yet been determined in all tumor types. 5.9 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue gemcitabine if CLS develops during therapy. 5.10 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue gemcitabine if PRES develops during therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in another section of the label Schedule-Dependent Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Embryo-fetal Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] The most common adverse reactions for the single agent (>=20%) are nausea/vomiting, anemia, hepatic transaminitis, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and peripheral edema (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to gemcitabine for injection as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (>=20%) adverse reactions of single-agent gemcitabine for injection are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (>=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued gemcitabine for injection due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine for injection in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine for injection in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent gemcitabine for injection across 5 clinical trials. Table 5 includes all clinical adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table.

Transfusion requirements — Red blood cell transfusions (19%); platelet transfusions (<1%) Fever — Fever occurred in the absence of clinical infection and frequently in combination with other flu-like symptoms. Pulmonary — Dyspnea unrelated to underlying disease and sometimes accompanied by bronchospasm. Edema — Edema (13%), peripheral edema (20%), and generalized edema (<1%); <1% of patients. discontinued gemcitabine for injection due to edema. Flu-like Symptoms — Characterized by fever, asthenia, anorexia, headache, cough, chills, myalgia, asthenia insomnia, rhinitis, sweating, and/or malaise (19%); <1% of patients discontinued gemcitabine for injection due to flu-like symptoms Infection — Sepsis (<1%) Extravasation — Injection-site reactions (4%) Allergic — Bronchospasm (<2%); anaphylactoid reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of gemcitabine for injection-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Patients randomized to gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

Table 7 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of gemcitabine for injection-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of gemcitabine for injection plus cisplatin (n=69) administered in 21-day cycles as compared to etoposide plus cisplatin alone (n=66) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table. Patients in the gemcitabine for injection cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the (GC) arm and 68% in the (EC) arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for treatment-related adverse events was 22% (GC) and 27% in the (EC) arm. The proportion of discontinuation of treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions was higher for patients in the (GC) arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the (GC) arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the gemcitabine for injection /cisplatin arm.

[see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Additional clinically significant adverse reactions, occurring in less than 10% of patients, are provided following Table 9. The proportion of patients with dose adjustments for carboplatin (1.8% versus 3.8%), doses of carboplatin omitted (0.2% versus 0), and discontinuing treatment for treatment-related adverse reactions (10.9% versus 9.8%), were similar between arms. Dose adjustment for gemcitabine for injection occurred in 10.4% of patients and gemcitabine for injection dose was omitted in 13.7% of patients in the gemcitabine for injection /carboplatin arm.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients receiving therapy with gemcitabine for injection should be monitored closely by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue gemcitabine for injection immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue gemcitabine for injection. (5.8) Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue gemcitabine for injection. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine for injection, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of gemcitabine for injection is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with gemcitabine for injection as a single agent and the risks are increased when gemcitabine for injection is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving gemcitabine for injection in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of gemcitabine for injection. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 )]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome to include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with gemcitabine for injection. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2 )]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of gemcitabine for injection and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Permanently discontinue gemcitabine for injection in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine for injection alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 and 6.2)]. Administration of gemcitabine for injection in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of gemcitabine for injection and periodically during treatment. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking gemcitabine for injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1) ] 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for injection is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) — Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which gemcitabine for injection was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) — Excessive toxicity has not been observed when gemcitabine for injection is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive gemcitabine for injection after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine for injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue gemcitabine for injection if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine for injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue gemcitabine for injection if PRES develops during therapy."

Single-Agent Use: The data described below reflect exposure to Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m2 to 1250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes intravenously, once weekly, in 979 patients with a variety of malignancies. The most common (>=20%) adverse reactions of single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased ALT, increased AST, neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (>=5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting; increased ALT, increase alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued Gemcitabine for Injection due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Gemcitabine for Injection in less than 1% of the 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions reported in 979 patients with various malignancies receiving single-agent Gemcitabine for Injection across 5 clinical trials. Table 5 includes all clinical adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients. A listing of clinically significant adverse reactions is provided following the table.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Table 6 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in >=10% of Gemcitabine for Injection -treated patients and at a higher incidence in the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial of Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin (n=262) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=260) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Patients randomized to Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (9/262 versus 2/260), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the Gemcitabine for Injection plus cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment- related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular — Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, Arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias. Vascular Disorders — Peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, and capillary leak syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions(5.8)]. Skin — Cellulitis, severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions Hepatic — Hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease Pulmonary — Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Nervous System - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]"

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) -Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) -Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) -Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) -Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) -Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) -Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life- threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (5.7) -Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection. (5.8) -Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection. (5.9) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine for Injection, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of Gemcitabine for Injection is influenced by the length of the infusion [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent and the risks are increased when Gemcitabine for Injection is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent Gemcitabine for injection. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemcitabine for Injection. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine for Injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <= 7 days apart) - Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which Gemcitabine for Injection was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given > 7 days apart) - Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemcitabine for Injection is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemcitabine for Injection after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection if CLS develops during therapy. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection if PRES develops during therapy."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular - Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, Arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias. Vascular Disorders - Peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, and capillary leak syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Skin - Cellulitis, severe skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions Hepatic - Hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease Pulmonary - Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-dependent toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. (5.1) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. (5.2, 5.7) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP immediately for unexplained new or worsening dyspnea or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. (5.3) Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP for HUS or severe renal impairment. (5.4) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during therapy. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP for severe hepatic toxicity. (5.5) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.6, 8.1) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. (5.7) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP. (5.8) 5.1 Schedule-dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine for Injection, USP, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of Gemcitabine for Injection, USP is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurs with Gemcitabine for Injection, USP as a single agent and the risks are increased when Gemcitabine for Injection, USP is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8 to 28%, and 5 to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection, USP in combination with another drug. 5.3 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of Gemcitabine for Injection, USP. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. 5.4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome to include fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis can occur in patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection, USP. In clinical trials, HUS was reported in 6 of 2429 patients (0.25%). Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection, USP and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develops anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, elevation of bilirubin or LDH, or reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (elevation of serum creatinine or BUN) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6)]. Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with discontinuation of therapy. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection, USP alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Administration of Gemcitabine for Injection, USP in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history or hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Gemcitabine for Injection, USP and periodically during treatment. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP in patients that develop severe liver injury. 5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, based on its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gemcitabine for Injection, USP, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. [see Use In Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.7 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine for Injection, USP is not indicated for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or <=7 days apart) - Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which Gemcitabine for Injection, USP was administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-concurrent (given >7 days apart) - Excessive toxicity has not been observed when Gemcitabine for Injection, USP is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who receive Gemcitabine for Injection, USP after prior radiation. 5.8 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection, USP as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Discontinue Gemcitabine for Injection, USP if CLS develops during therapy."
