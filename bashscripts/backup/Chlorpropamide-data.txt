        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Body as a Whole: Disulfiram-like reactions have rarely been reported with chlorpropamide (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). Central and Peripheral Nervous System: Dizziness and headache. Hypoglycemia: See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE. Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal disturbances are the most common reactions; nausea has been reported in less than 5% of patients, and diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, and hunger in less than 2%. Other gastrointestinal disturbances have occurred in less than 1% of patients including proctocolitis. They tend to be dose related and may disappear when dosage is reduced. Liver/Biliary: Cholestatic jaundice may occur rarely; chlorpropamide should be discontinued if this occurs. Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported with chlorpropamide. Skin/Appendages: Pruritus has been reported in less than 3% of patients. Other allergic skin reactions, e.g., urticaria and maculopapular eruptions have been reported in approximately 1% or less of patients. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of chlorpropamide; if skin reactions persist the drug should be discontinued. As with other sulfonylureas, porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported. Skin eruptions rarely progressing to erythema multiforme and exfoliative dermatitis have also been reported. Hematologic Reactions: Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, and eosinophilia have been reported with sulfonylureas. Metabolic/Nutritional Reactions: Hypoglycemia (see PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE). Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported with chlorpropamide (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). Endocrine Reactions: On rare occasions, chlorpropamide has caused a reaction identical to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. The features of this syndrome result from excessive water retention and include hyponatremia, low serum osmolality, and high urine osmolality. This reaction has also been reported for other sulfonylureas."
