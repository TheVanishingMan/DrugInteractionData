Magnesium-containing antacids and doxercalciferol should not be used concomitantly because such use may lead to the development of hypermagnesemia (see WARNINGS ). Although not examined specifically, enzyme inducers (such as glutethimide and phenobarbitol) may affect the 25-hydroxylation of doxercalciferol and may necessitate dosage adjustments.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Doxercalciferol injection has been evaluated for safety in 70 patients with chronic renal disease on hemodialysis (who had been previously treated with oral doxercalciferol) from two 12-week, open-label, single-arm, multi-centered studies. (Dosage titrated to achieve target plasma iPTH levels, see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies .) Because there was no placebo group included in the studies of doxercalciferol injection, Table 4 provides the adverse event incidence rates from placebo-controlled studies of oral doxercalciferol.

Late Polyuria, polydipsia, anorexia, weight loss, nocturia, conjunctivitis (calcific), pancreatitis, photophobia, rhinorrhea, pruritus, hyperthermia, decreased libido, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albuminuria, hypercholesterolemia, elevated serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), ectopic calcification, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, sensory disturbances, dehydration, apathy, arrested growth, urinary tract infections, and, rarely, overt psychosis."
