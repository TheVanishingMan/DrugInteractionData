        "Drug Interactions Mitoxantrone and its metabolites are excreted in bile and urine, but it is not known whether the metabolic or excretory pathways are saturable, may be inhibited or induced, or if mitoxantrone and its metabolites undergo enterohepatic circulation. To date, postmarketing experience has not revealed any significant drug interactions in patients who have received mitoxantrone injection for treatment of cancer. Information on drug interactions in patients with multiple sclerosis is limited. Following concurrent administration of mitoxantrone injection with corticosteroids, no evidence of drug interactions has been observed."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Multiple Sclerosis Mitoxantrone injection has been administered to 149 patients with multiple sclerosis in two randomized clinical trials, including 21 patients who received mitoxantrone injection in combination with corticosteroids. In Study 1, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event was 9.7% (n = 6) in the 12 mg/m2 mitoxantrone injection arm (leukopenia, depression, decreased LV function, bone pain and emesis, renal failure, and one discontinuation to prevent future complications from repeated urinary tract infections) compared to 3.1% (n = 2) in the placebo arm (hepatitis and myocardial infarction). The following clinical adverse experiences were significantly more frequent in the mitoxantrone injection groups: nausea, alopecia, urinary tract infection, and menstrual disorders, including amenorrhea. Table 4a summarizes clinical adverse events of all intensities occurring in >= 5% of patients in either dose group of mitoxantrone injection and that were numerically greater on drug than on placebo in Study 1. The majority of these events were of mild to moderate intensity, and nausea was the only adverse event that occurred with severe intensity in more than one patient (three patients [5%] in the 12 mg/m2 group). Of note, alopecia consisted of mild hair thinning. Two of the 127 patients treated with mitoxantrone injection in Study 1 had decreased LVEF to below 50% at some point during the 2 years of treatment. An additional patient receiving 12 mg/m2 did not have LVEF measured, but had another echocardiographic measure of ventricular function (fractional shortening) that led to discontinuation from the study.

However, few of these infections required hospitalization: one placebo patient (tonsillitis), three 5 mg/m2 patients (enteritis, urinary tract infection, viral infection), and four 12 mg/m2 patients (tonsillitis, urinary tract infection [two], endometritis). Table 4b summarizes laboratory abnormalities that occurred in >= 5% of patients in either mitoxantrone injection dose group, and that were numerically more frequent than in the placebo group.

Only mild to moderate intensity infections were reported in 9 of 21 patients in the M + MP group and in 3 of 21 patients in the MP group; none of these required hospitalization. There was no difference among treatment groups in the incidence or severity of hemorrhagic events. There were no withdrawals from Study 2 for safety reasons. Leukemia Mitoxantrone injection has been studied in approximately 600 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Table 6 represents the adverse reaction experience in the large U.S. comparative study of mitoxantrone + cytarabine vs. daunorubicin + cytarabine. Experience in the large international study was similar. A much wider experience in a variety of other tumor types revealed no additional important reactions other than cardiomyopathy (see WARNINGS ). It should be appreciated that the listed adverse reaction categories include overlapping clinical symptoms related to the same condition, e.g., dyspnea, cough and pneumonia. In addition, the listed adverse reactions cannot all necessarily be attributed to chemotherapy as it is often impossible to distinguish effects of the drug and effects of the underlying disease. It is clear, however, that the combination of mitoxantrone injection + cytarabine was responsible for nausea and vomiting, alopecia, mucositis/stomatitis, and myelosuppression. Table 6 summarizes adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with mitoxantrone injection + cytarabine in comparison with those who received daunorubicin + cytarabine for therapy of ANLL in a large multicenter randomized prospective U.S. trial. Adverse reactions are presented as major categories and selected examples of clinically significant subcategories.

Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported rarely. Cutaneous Extravasation at the infusion site has been reported, which may result in erythema, swelling, pain, burning, and/or blue discoloration of the skin. Extravasation can result in tissue necrosis with resultant need for debridement and skin grafting. Phlebitis has also been reported at the site of the infusion. Hematologic Topoisomerase II inhibitors, including mitoxantrone injection, in combination with other antineoplastic agents or alone, have been associated with the development of acute leukemia (see WARNINGS ). Leukemia Myelosuppression is rapid in onset and is consistent with the requirement to produce significant marrow hypoplasia in order to achieve a response in acute leukemia. The incidences of infection and bleeding seen in the U.S. trial are consistent with those reported for other standard induction regimens. Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer In a randomized study where dose escalation was required for neutrophil counts greater than 1000/mm3, Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm3) was observed in 54% of patients treated with mitoxantrone injection + low-dose prednisone. In a separate randomized trial where patients were treated with 14 mg/m2, Grade 4 neutropenia in 23% of patients treated with mitoxantrone injection + hydrocortisone was observed. Neutropenic fever/infection occurred in 11% and 10% of patients receiving mitoxantrone injection + corticosteroids, respectively, on the two trials. Platelets < 50,000/mm3 were noted in 4% and 3% of patients receiving mitoxantrone injection + corticosteroids on these trials, and there was one patient death on mitoxantrone injection + hydrocortisone due to intracranial hemorrhage after a fall. Gastrointestinal Nausea and vomiting occurred acutely in most patients and may have contributed to reports of dehydration, but were generally mild to moderate and could be controlled through the use of antiemetics. Stomatitis/mucositis occurred within 1 week of therapy. Cardiovascular Congestive heart failure, tachycardia, EKG changes including arrhythmias, chest pain, and asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have occurred (see WARNINGS ). Pulmonary Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported in cancer patients receiving combination chemotherapy that included mitoxantrone injection."

Platelets < 50,000/mm3 were noted in 4% and 3% of patients receiving mitoxantrone + corticosteroids on these trials, and there was one patient death on mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone due to intracranial hemorrhage after a fall. Gastrointestinal - Nausea and vomiting occurred acutely in most patients and may have contributed to reports of dehydration, but were generally mild to moderate and could be controlled through the use of antiemetics. Stomatitis/mucositis occurred within 1 week of therapy. Cardiovascular - Congestive heart failure, tachycardia, EKG changes including arrhythmias, chest pain, and asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have occurred. (See WARNINGS ). Pulmonary - Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported in cancer patients receiving combination chemotherapy that included mitoxantrone."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Multiple Sclerosis MitoXANTRONE Injection has been administered to 149 patients with multiple sclerosis in two randomized clinical trials, including 21 patients who received MitoXANTRONE Injection in combination with corticosteroids. In Study 1, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event was 9.7% (n = 6) in the 12 mg/m2 MitoXANTRONE Injection arm (leukopenia, depression, decreased LV function, bone pain and emesis, renal failure, and one discontinuation to prevent future complications from repeated urinary tract infections) compared to 3.1% (n = 2) in the placebo arm (hepatitis and myocardial infarction). The following clinical adverse experiences were significantly more frequent in the MitoXANTRONE Injection groups: nausea, alopecia, urinary tract infection, and menstrual disorders, including amenorrhea. Table 4a summarizes clinical adverse events of all intensities occurring in >= 5% of patients in either dose group of MitoXANTRONE Injection and that were numerically greater on drug than on placebo in Study 1. The majority of these events were of mild to moderate intensity, and nausea was the only adverse event that occurred with severe intensity in more than one patient (three patients [5%] in the 12 mg/m2 group). Of note, alopecia consisted of mild hair thinning. Two of the 127 patients treated with MitoXANTRONE Injection in Study 1 had decreased LVEF to below 50% at some point during the 2 years of treatment. An additional patient receiving 12 mg/m2 did not have LVEF measured, but had another echocardiographic measure of ventricular function (fractional shortening) that led to discontinuation from the study.

However, few of these infections required hospitalization: one placebo patient (tonsillitis), three 5 mg/m2 patients (enteritis, urinary tract infection, viral infection), and four 12 mg/m2 patients (tonsillitis, urinary tract infection [two], endometritis).

There was no difference among treatment groups in the incidence or severity of hemorrhagic events. There were no withdrawals from Study 2 for safety reasons. Leukemia MitoXANTRONE Injection has been studied in approximately 600 patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Table 6 represents the adverse reaction experience in the large U.S. comparative study of mitoxantrone + cytarabine vs daunorubicin + cytarabine. Experience in the large international study was similar. A much wider experience in a variety of other tumor types revealed no additional important reactions other than cardiomyopathy (see WARNINGS ). It should be appreciated that the listed adverse reaction categories include overlapping clinical symptoms related to the same condition, e.g., dyspnea, cough and pneumonia. In addition, the listed adverse reactions cannot all necessarily be attributed to chemotherapy as it is often impossible to distinguish effects of the drug and effects of the underlying disease. It is clear, however, that the combination of MitoXANTRONE Injection + cytarabine was responsible for nausea and vomiting, alopecia, mucositis/stomatitis, and myelosuppression. Table 6 summarizes adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with MitoXANTRONE Injection + cytarabine in comparison with those who received daunorubicin + cytarabine for therapy of ANLL in a large multicenter randomized prospective U.S. trial. Adverse reactions are presented as major categories and selected examples of clinically significant subcategories.

Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported rarely. Cutaneous Extravasation at the infusion site has been reported, which may result in erythema, swelling, pain, burning, and/or blue discoloration of the skin. Extravasation can result in tissue necrosis with resultant need for debridement and skin grafting. Phlebitis has also been reported at the site of the infusion. Hematologic Topoisomerase II inhibitors, including MitoXANTRONE Injection, in combination with other antineoplastic agents or alone, have been associated with the development of acute leukemia (see WARNINGS ). Leukemia Myelosuppression is rapid in onset and is consistent with the requirement to produce significant marrow hypoplasia in order to achieve a response in acute leukemia. The incidences of infection and bleeding seen in the U.S. trial are consistent with those reported for other standard induction regimens. Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer In a randomized study where dose escalation was required for neutrophil counts greater than 1000/mm3, Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500 /mm3) was observed in 54% of patients treated with MitoXANTRONE Injection + low-dose prednisone. In a separate randomized trial where patients were treated with 14 mg/m2, Grade 4 neutropenia in 23% of patients treated with MitoXANTRONE Injection + hydrocortisone was observed. Neutropenic fever/infection occurred in 11% and 10% of patients receiving MitoXANTRONE Injection + corticosteroids, respectively, on the two trials. Platelets < 50,000/mm3 were noted in 4% and 3% of patients receiving MitoXANTRONE Injection + corticosteroids on these trials, and there was one patient death on MitoXANTRONE Injection + hydrocortisone due to intracranial hemorrhage after a fall. Gastrointestinal Nausea and vomiting occurred acutely in most patients and may have contributed to reports of dehydration, but were generally mild to moderate and could be controlled through the use of antiemetics. Stomatitis/mucositis occurred within 1 week of therapy. Cardiovascular Congestive heart failure, tachycardia, EKG changes including arrhythmias, chest pain, and asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have occurred. (See WARNINGS ) Pulmonary Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported in cancer patients receiving combination chemotherapy that included MitoXANTRONE Injection.

General Allergic Reaction Hypotension, urticaria, dyspnea, and rashes have been reported occasionally. Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported rarely. Cutaneous Extravasation at the infusion site has been reported, which may result in erythema, swelling, pain, burning, and/or blue discoloration of the skin. Extravasation can result in tissue necrosis with resultant need for debridement and skin grafting. Phlebitis has also been reported at the site of the infusion. Hematologic Topoisomerase II inhibitors, including mitoxantrone, in combination with other antineoplastic agents or alone, have been associated with the development of acute leukemia (see WARNINGS ). Leukemia Myelosuppression is rapid in onset and is consistent with the requirement to produce significant marrow hypoplasia in order to achieve a response in acute leukemia. The incidences of infection and bleeding seen in the U.S. trial are consistent with those reported for other standard induction regimens. Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer In a randomized study where dose escalation was required for neutrophil counts greater than 1000/mm3, Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500 /mm3) was observed in 54% of patients treated with mitoxantrone + low-dose prednisone. In a separate randomized trial where patients were treated with 14 mg/m2, Grade 4 neutropenia in 23% of patients treated with mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone was observed. Neutropenic fever/infection occurred in 11% and 10% of patients receiving mitoxantrone + corticosteroids, respectively, on the two trials. Platelets < 50,000/mm3 were noted in 4% and 3% of patients receiving mitoxantrone + corticosteroids on these trials, and there was one patient death on mitoxantrone + hydrocortisone due to intracranial hemorrhage after a fall. Gastrointestinal Nausea and vomiting occurred acutely in most patients and may have contributed to reports of dehydration, but were generally mild to moderate and could be controlled through the use of antiemetics. Stomatitis/mucositis occurred within 1 week of therapy. Cardiovascular Congestive heart failure, tachycardia, EKG changes including arrhythmias, chest pain, and asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction have occurred (see WARNINGS ). Pulmonary Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported in cancer patients receiving combination chemotherapy that included mitoxantrone.",
