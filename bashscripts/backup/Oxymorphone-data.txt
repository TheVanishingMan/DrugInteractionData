        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.1) Misuse, abuse, and diversion: OPANA is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. (5.2) CNS effects: Additive CNS-depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.3) Head injury: Effects may be markedly exaggerated. Administer with extreme caution. (5.4) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.5) Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function (5.6) Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus. (5.8) Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.9) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.10) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of OPANA. Respiratory depression may occur more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia, when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer OPANA with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression, or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use OPANA only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.2 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids OPANA contains oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. OPANA tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. OPANA may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of OPANA. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store OPANA in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other non-caregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.3 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including other opioids, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, and alcohol with oxymorphone may produce increased depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer OPANA with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.5 Hypotensive Effect OPANA, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer OPANA with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use OPANA with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)]. OPANA is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.7 Special Risk Groups Use OPANA with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Effects Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of OPANA may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. OPANA is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease OPANA, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed WARNINGS Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients, and patients with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk of respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Interaction with CNS depressants: Consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive effects. (5.7, 7.2) Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.10) Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.2) 5.1 Abuse Potential Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain oxymorphone, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in situations where there is concern about increased risks of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain. Assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction prior to prescribing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. The risk for opioid abuse is increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because these drugs carry a risk for addiction even under appropriate medical use. Misuse or abuse of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk that could result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life Threatening Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the primary risk of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a "sighing" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and following dose increases. Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was prescribed and to keep oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets out of the reach of children, as such inappropriate use may result in fatal respiratory depression. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. Overestimating the oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Respiratory depression has also been reported with use of modified-release opioids when used as recommended and not misused or abused. To further reduce the risk of respiratory depression, consider the following: Proper dosing and titration are essential and oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. Instruct patients to swallow oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed. The resulting oxymorphone dose may be fatal, particularly in opioid-naive individuals. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with respiratory depression and in patients with conditions that increase the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure Accidental consumption of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxymorphone. 5.4 Interaction with Alcohol The co-ingestion of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in an increase of oxymorphone plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone. Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.5 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Therefore, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Interactions with CNS Depressants and Illicit Drugs Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, or respiratory depression may result if oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used concomitantly with other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, consider the patient's use, if any, of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet therapy is to be initiated in a patient taking a CNS depressant, start with a lower oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet dose than usual and monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment reduce the starting dose to the lowest dose and monitor for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 5.9 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with other GI obstruction. The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.12 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablet therapy. 5.13 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonists analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Do not abruptly discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.14 Driving and Operating Machinery Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CNS depressants: Increased risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death. When combined therapy with CNS depressant is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. (7.1) Mixed agonist/antagonist opioids (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol): May reduce analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.2) Cimetidine: Combination use may precipitate confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures. (7.3) Anticholinergics: May result in urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. (7.4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Potentiate the action of opioids. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.5) 7.1 Use with CNS Depressants The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol may produce additive CNS depressant effects. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma and death may result and titrated slowly as necessary for adequate pain relief. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.2 Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxymorphone. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxymorphone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 7.3 Cimetidine CNS side effects have been reported (e.g., confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures) following coadministration of cimetidine with opioid analgesics; a causal relationship has not been established. 7.4 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. 7.5 MAO Inhibitors Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. No specific interaction between oxymorphone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.1) Misuse, abuse, and diversion: Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. (5.2) CNS effects: Additive CNS-depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.3) Head injury: Effects may be markedly exaggerated. Administer with extreme caution. (5.4) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.5) Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function (5.6) Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus. (5.8) Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.9) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.10) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. Respiratory depression may occur more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia, when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression, or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.2 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets contain oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other non-caregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.3 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including other opioids, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, and alcohol with oxymorphone may produce increased depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.5 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.7 Special Risk Groups Use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Effects Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

(7.6) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions Oxymorphone is highly metabolized principally in the liver and undergoes reduction or conjugation with glucuronic acid to form both active and inactive metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Clinical drug interaction studies with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets showed no induction of CYP450 3A4 or 2C9 enzyme activity, indicating that no dose adjustment for CYP 3A4- or 2C9-mediated drug-drug interactions is required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Use with CNS Depressants The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol may produce additive CNS depressant effects. OPANA ER should be started at 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma and death may result, and titrated slowly as necessary for adequate pain relief.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed WARNINGS Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.2) Misuse, abuse, and diversion: OPANA ER is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. (5.3) CNS effects: Additive CNS-depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.4) Head Injury: Effects may be markedly exaggerated. Administer OPANA ER with extreme caution. (5.5) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.6) Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function. (5.7) Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction. (5.9) Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.11) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.12) 5.1 Information Essential for Safe Administration OPANA ER tablets are to be swallowed whole, and are not to be cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved. Taking cut, broken, chewed, dissolved, or crushed OPANA ER tablets could lead to the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxymorphone [see Boxed Warning]. Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages, or prescription or non-prescription medications containing alcohol, while on OPANA ER therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with OPANA ER may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom OPANA ER was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. 5.2 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of OPANA ER. Respiratory depression is a potential problem in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer OPANA ER with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use OPANA ER only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.3 Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids OPANA ER contains oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. OPANA ER tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting or injecting the product. These practices will result in the less controlled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. OPANA ER may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of OPANA ER. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store OPANA ER in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other non-caregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.4 Interactions with Alcohol and other CNS Depressants Patients receiving other opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines or other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with oxymorphone may experience respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions(7.2)]. Avoid concurrent use of alcohol and OPANA ER [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. 5.5 Use in Patients with Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the possible respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer OPANA ER with extreme caution to patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.6 Hypotensive Effect OPANA ER may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer OPANA ER with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment A study of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Use OPANA ER with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.8 Special Risk Groups Use OPANA ER with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison\"s disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.9 Gastrointestinal Effects OPANA ER decreases bowel motility. Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of OPANA ER may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.10 Ambulatory Surgery and Post-Operative Use OPANA ER is not indicated for pre-emptive analgesia (administration pre-operatively for the management of post-operative pain). OPANA ER is only indicated for postoperative use in the patient if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (see American Pain Society Guidelines). Patients who are already receiving OPANA ER as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention. 5.11 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease OPANA ER, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.12 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics, including OPANA ER, may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.1) -Misuse, abuse, and diversion: Oxymorphone hydrochloride is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. (5.2) -CNS effects: Additive CNS-depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.3) -Head injury: Effects may be markedly exaggerated. Administer with extreme caution. (5.4) -Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.5) -Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function (5.6) -Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus. (5.8) -Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.9) -Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.10) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of oxymorphone hydrochloride. Respiratory depression may occur more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia, when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression, or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use oxymorphone hydrochloride only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.2 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets contain oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other non-caregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.3 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including other opioids, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, and alcohol with oxymorphone may produce increased depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Use in Patients With Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.5 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use oxymorphone hydrochloride with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.7 Special Risk Groups Use oxymorphone hydrochloride with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Effects Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxymorphone hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Oxymorphone hydrochloride, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CNS depressants: Increased risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death. When combined therapy with CNS depressant is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. (7.1) Mixed agonist/antagonist opioids (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol): May reduce analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.2) Cimetidine: Combination use may precipitate confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures. (7.3) Anticholinergics: May result in urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. (7.4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Potentiate the action of opioids. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.5) 7.1 Use with CNS Depressants The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol may produce additive CNS depressant effects. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma and death may result and titrated slowly as necessary for adequate pain relief. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.2 Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxymorphone. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxymorphone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 7.3 Cimetidine CNS side effects have been reported (e.g., confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures) following coadministration of cimetidine with opioid analgesics; a causal relationship has not been established. 7.4 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. 7.5 MAO Inhibitors Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. No specific interaction between oxymorphone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release because they may reduce analgesic effect of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.3) 7.1 Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release can result in an increase of oxymorphone plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone. Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release with other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 7.3 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol), and partial agonists (buprenorphine) may reduce the analgesic effect of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release. 7.4 Muscle Relaxants Oxymorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.5 Cimetidine Cimetidine can potentiate opioid-induced respiratory depression. Monitor patients for respiratory depression when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release and cimetidine are used concurrently. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed WARNINGS Interaction with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If coadministration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive pharmacological effects. (5.4, 7.2) Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.8) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.9) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release contains oxymorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxymorphone present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release, and monitor all patients receiving oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxymorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release is essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. Overestimating the oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxymorphone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release is made, start with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release 5 mg every 12 hours, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release and when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment reduce the starting dose to the lowest dose and monitor for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 5.8 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release. In patients with circulatory shock, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release in patients with other GI obstruction. The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release, gradually taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Do not abruptly discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release and know how they will react to the medication."

        "Drug-Drug Interactions In vitro studies revealed little to no biotransformation of oxymorphone to 6-OH-oxymorphone by any of the major cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) isoforms at therapeutically relevant oxymorphone plasma concentrations. No inhibition of any of the major CYP P450 isoforms was observed when oxymorphone was incubated with human liver microsomes at concentrations of <=50 µM. An inhibition of CYP 3A4 activity occurred at oxymorphone concentrations >=150 µM. Therefore, it is not expected that oxymorphone, or its metabolites will act as inhibitors of any of the major CYP P450 enzymes in vivo. Increases in the activity of the CYP 2C9 and CYP 3A4 isoforms occurred when oxymorphone was incubated with human hepatocytes. However, clinical drug interaction studies with OPANA ER showed no induction of CYP450 3A4 or 2C9 enzyme activity, indicating that no dose adjustment for CYP 3A4- or 2C9-mediated drug-drug interactions is required.

(5.5, 5.6) Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions: If symptoms occur, stop administrations immediately, discontinue permanently, and do not rechallenge with any other oxymorphone formulation. (5.7) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.8) Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.10) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.11) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying G1 disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.12) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain oxymorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxymorphone present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and monitor all patients receiving oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxymorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2 ) ]. Overestimating the oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxymorphone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is made, start with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets 5 mg every 12 hours, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have occurred in patients treated with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the postmarket setting. The most commonly described clinical features in these reports were swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, lips, tongue, hands, and/or throat; dyspnea; hives, pruritus, and/or rash; and nausea/vomiting. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately, discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of oxymorphone. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one 1 month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment reduce the starting dose to the lowest dose and monitor for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 5.10 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been post-marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick or otherwise wet oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare post-marketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.13 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with other GI obstruction. The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.14 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Do not abruptly discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed WARNINGS Interaction with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If coadministration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive pharmacological effects. (5.4, 7.2) Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.8) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.9) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain oxymorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxymorphone present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and monitor all patients receiving oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxymorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. Overestimating the oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxymorphone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is made, start with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets 5 mg every 12 hours, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment reduce the starting dose to the lowest dose and monitor for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 5.8 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with other GI obstruction. The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Do not abruptly discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CNS depressants: Increased risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death. When combined therapy with CNS depressant is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. (7.1) Mixed agonist/antagonist opioids (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol): May reduce analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.2) Cimetidine: Combination use may precipitate confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures. (7.3) Anticholinergics: May result in urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. (7.4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Potentiate the action of opioids. Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.5) 7.1 Use with CNS Depressants The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol may produce additive CNS depressant effects. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma and death may result and titrated slowly as necessary for adequate pain relief. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. 7.2 Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxymorphone. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxymorphone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 7.3 Cimetidine CNS side effects have been reported (e.g., confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures) following coadministration of cimetidine with opioid analgesics; a causal relationship has not been established. 7.4 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. 7.5 MAO Inhibitors Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. No specific interaction between oxymorphone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.1) Misuse, abuse, and diversion: Oxymorphone Hydrochloride is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. (5.2) CNS effects: Additive CNS-depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.3) Head injury: Effects may be markedly exaggerated. Administer with extreme caution. (5.4) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.5) Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function (5.6) Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus. (5.8) Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.9) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.10) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. Respiratory depression may occur more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia, when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression, or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.2 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets contain oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other non-caregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.3 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including other opioids, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, and alcohol with oxymorphone may produce increased depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.5 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.5 )]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.7 Special Risk Groups Use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Effects Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.5 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.7 Special Risk Groups Use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Effects Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7.3) Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.4) 7.1 Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in an increase of oxymorphone plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone. Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 7.3 Serotonergic Drugs The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), , triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 7.4 Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol), and partial agonists (buprenorphine) may reduce the analgesic effect of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 7.5 Muscle Relaxants Oxymorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.6 Cimetidine Cimetidine can potentiate opioid-induced respiratory depression. Monitor patients for respiratory depression when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and cimetidine are used concurrently. 7.7 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

The safety of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets was evaluated in a total of 2011 patients in open-label and controlled clinical trials. The clinical trials enrolled of patients with moderate to severe chronic non-malignant pain, cancer pain, and post surgical pain. The most common serious adverse events reported with administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets were chest pain, pneumonia and vomiting. Tables 1 and 2 list the most frequently occurring adverse reactions (in at least 5% of patients) from the placebo-controlled trials in patients with low back pain.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Nervous system disorder: amnesia, convulsion, memory impairment Serotonin syndrome, adrenal insufficiency Anaphylaxis, angioedema, and other hypersensitivity reactions Androgen deficiency: Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ​ See Boxed WARNINGS Interaction with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If coadministration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive pharmacological effects. (5.4 ) Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions: If symptoms occur, stop administrations immediately, discontinue permanently, and do not rechallenge with any other oxymorphone formulation. (5.7) Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.8) Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.10) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.11) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty swallowing or have underlying G1 disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.12) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain oxymorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxymorphone present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and monitor all patients receiving oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxymorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2 ) ]. Overestimating the oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxymorphone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is made, start with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets 5 mg every 12 hours, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have occurred in patients treated with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the postmarket setting. The most commonly described clinical features in these reports were swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, lips, tongue, hands, and/or throat; dyspnea; hives, pruritus, and/or rash; and nausea/vomiting. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately, discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of oxymorphone. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one 1 month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment reduce the starting dose to the lowest dose and monitor for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 5.10 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been post-marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick or otherwise wet oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare post-marketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.13 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with other GI obstruction. The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.14 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Do not abruptly discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CNS depressants: Increased risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death. When combined therapy with CNS depressant is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. (7.1) Mixed agonist/antagonist opioids (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol): May reduce analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.2) Cimetidine: Combination use may precipitate confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures. (7.3) Anticholinergics: May result in urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. (7.4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Potentiate the action of opioids. OPANA should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.5) 7.1 Use with CNS Depressants The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol may produce additive CNS depressant effects. OPANA, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma and death may result and titrated slowly as necessary for adequate pain relief. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.2 Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxymorphone. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxymorphone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 7.3 Cimetidine CNS side effects have been reported (e.g., confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures) following coadministration of cimetidine with opioid analgesics; a causal relationship has not been established. 7.4 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. 7.5 MAO Inhibitors Opana is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. No specific interaction between oxymorphone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.1) Misuse, abuse, and diversion: OPANA is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. (5.2) CNS effects: Additive CNS-depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.3) Head injury: Effects may be markedly exaggerated. Administer with extreme caution. (5.4) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.5) Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function (5.6) Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus. (5.8) Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.9) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.10) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of OPANA. Respiratory depression may occur more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia, when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer OPANA with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression, or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use OPANA only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.2 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids OPANA contains oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. OPANA tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. OPANA may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of OPANA. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store OPANA in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other non-caregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.3 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including other opioids, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, and alcohol with oxymorphone may produce increased depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer OPANA with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.5 Hypotensive Effect OPANA, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer OPANA with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use OPANA with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)]. OPANA is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.7 Special Risk Groups Use OPANA with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Effects Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of OPANA may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. OPANA is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease OPANA, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CNS depressants: Increased risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death. When combined therapy with CNS depressant is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. (7.2) Mixed agonist/antagonist opioids (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol): May reduce analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.3) Cimetidine: Combination use may precipitate confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures. (7.4) Anticholinergics: May result in urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. (7.5) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Potentiate the action of opioids. OPANA ER should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.6) Dose adjustment for CYP3A450 or 2C9-mediated drug-drug interactions is not required. (7.1) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions Oxymorphone is highly metabolized principally in the liver and undergoes reduction or conjugation with glucuronic acid to form both active and inactive metabolites [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]). Clinical drug interaction studies with OPANA ER showed no induction of CYP450 3A4 or 2C9 enzyme activity, indicating that no dose adjustment for CYP 3A4- or 2C9-mediated drug-drug interactions is required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Use with CNS Depressants The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol may produce additive CNS depressant effects. OPANA ER should be started at 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma and death may result, and titrated slowly as necessary for adequate pain relief. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 7.3 Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, or buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic, such as oxymorphone. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxymorphone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 7.4 Cimetidine CNS side effects have been reported (e.g., confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures) following coadministration of cimetidine with opioid analgesics; a causal relationship has not been established. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. 7.6 MAO Inhibitors OPANA ER is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. No specific interaction between oxymorphone and MAO inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed WARNINGS Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.2) Misuse, abuse, and diversion: OPANA ER is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. (5.3) CNS effects: Additive CNS-depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.4) Head Injury: Effects may be markedly exaggerated. Administer with extreme caution. (5.5) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.6) Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function. (5.7) Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction. (5.9) Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.11) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities (5.12) 5.1 Information Essential for Safe Administration OPANA ER tablets are to be swallowed whole, and are not to be broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved. Taking broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved OPANA ER tablets could lead to the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxymorphone [see Boxed Warning]. Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages, or prescription or non-prescription medications containing alcohol, while on OPANA ER therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with OPANA ER may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom OPANA ER was prescribed, as such inappropriate use may have severe medical consequences, including death. 5.2 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of OPANA ER. Respiratory depression is a potential problem in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer OPANA ER with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use OPANA ER only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.3 Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Opioids OPANA ER contains oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. OPANA ER tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting or injecting the product. These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. OPANA ER may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of OPANA ER. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store OPANA ER in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other non-caregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.4 Interactions with Alcohol and other CNS Depressants Patients receiving other opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines or other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with oxymorphone may experience respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions (7.2]). Avoid concurrent use of alcohol and OPANA ER [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. 5.5 Use in Patients with Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the possible respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer OPANA ER with extreme caution to patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.6 Hypotensive Effect OPANA ER may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer OPANA ER with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.7 Hepatic Impairment A study of OPANA ER in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [See Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Use OPANA ER with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.8 Special Risk Groups Use OPANA ER with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.9 Gastrointestinal Effects OPANA ER decreases bowel motility. Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of OPANA ER may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.10 Ambulatory Surgery and Post-Operative Use OPANA ER is not indicated for pre-emptive analgesia (administration pre-operatively for the management of post-operative pain). OPANA ER is only indicated for postoperative use in the patient if the patient is already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate (see American Pain Society guidelines). Patients who are already receiving OPANA ER as part of ongoing analgesic therapy may be safely continued on the drug if appropriate dosage adjustments are made considering the procedure, other drugs given, and the temporary changes in physiology caused by the surgical intervention. 5.11 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease OPANA ER, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.12 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

        "Drug-Drug Interactions In vitro studies revealed little to no biotransformation of oxymorphone to 6-OH-oxymorphone by any of the major cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) isoforms at therapeutically relevant oxymorphone plasma concentrations. No inhibition of any of the major CYP P450 isoforms was observed when oxymorphone was incubated with human liver microsomes at concentrations of <= 50 μM. An inhibition of CYP3A4 activity occurred at oxymorphone concentrations >=150 µM. Therefore, it is not expected that oxymorphone, or its metabolites will act as inhibitors of any of the major CYP P450 enzymes in vivo. Increases in the activity of the CYP 2C9 and CYP 3A4 isoforms occurred when oxymorphone was incubated with human hepatocytes. However, clinical drug interaction studies with OPANA ER showed no induction of CYP450 3A4 or 2C9 enzyme activity, indicating that no dose adjustment for CYP 3A4- or 2C9-mediated drug-drug interactions is required.",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed WARNINGS Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients, and patients with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk of respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Interaction with CNS depressants: Consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive effects. (5.7, 7.2) Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of OPANA ER in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO 2 retention. (5.10) Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.2) 5.1 Abuse Potential OPANA ER contains oxymorphone, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OPANA ER in situations where there is concern about increased risks of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain. Assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction prior to prescribing OPANA ER. The risk for opioid abuse is increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because these drugs carry a risk for addiction even under appropriate medical use. Misuse or abuse of OPANA ER by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk that could result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10 )]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life Threatening Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the primary risk of OPANA ER. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a "sighing" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OPANA ER, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with OPANA ER and following dose increases. Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom OPANA ER was prescribed and to keep OPANA ER out of the reach of children, as such inappropriate use may result in fatal respiratory depression. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OPANA ER are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. Overestimating the OPANA ER dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Respiratory depression has also been reported with use of modified-release opioids when used as recommended and not misused or abused. To further reduce the risk of respiratory depression, consider the following: Proper dosing and titration are essential and OPANA ER should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain. Instruct patients to swallow OPANA ER tablets intact. The tablets are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed. The resulting oxymorphone dose may be fatal, particularly in opioid-naive individuals. OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with respiratory depression and in patients with conditions that increase the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure Accidental consumption of OPANA ER, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxymorphone. 5.4 Interaction with Alcohol The co-ingestion of alcohol with OPANA ER can result in an increase of oxymorphone plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone. Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on OPANA ER therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Therefore, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OPANA ER and when OPANA ER is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with OPANA ER, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of OPANA ER may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Interactions with CNS Depressants and Illicit Drugs Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, or respiratory depression may result if OPANA ER is used concomitantly with other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of OPANA ER in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, consider the patient's use, if any, of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If OPANA ER therapy is to be initiated in a patient taking a CNS depressant, start with a lower OPANA ER dose than usual and monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.2 )]. 5.8 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study of OPANA ER in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment reduce the starting dose to the lowest dose and monitor for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 5.9 Hypotensive Effect OPANA ER may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of OPANA ER. In patients with circulatory shock, OPANA ER may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OPANA ER in patients with circulatory shock. 5.10 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking OPANA ER who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OPANA ER. OPANA ER may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OPANA ER in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.11 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of OPANA ER in patients with other GI obstruction. The oxymorphone in OPANA ER may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.12 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxymorphone in OPANA ER may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OPANA ER therapy. 5.13 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including OPANA ER. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonists analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing OPANA ER, gradually taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Do not abruptly discontinue OPANA ER. 5.14 Driving and Operating Machinery OPANA ER may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OPANA ER and know how they will react to the medication."

(7.5) 7.1 Use with CNS Depressants The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol may produce additive CNS depressant effects. Oxymorphone hydrochloride, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma and death may result and titrated slowly as necessary for adequate pain relief.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.1) Misuse, abuse, and diversion: Oxymorphone Hydrochloride is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. (5.2) CNS effects: Additive CNS-depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.3) Head injury: Effects may be markedly exaggerated. Administer with extreme caution. (5.4) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.5) Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function (5.6) Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus. (5.8) Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.9) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.10) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of oxymorphone hydrochloride. Respiratory depression may occur more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia, when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression, or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use oxymorphone hydrochloride only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.2 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids Oxymorphone hydrochloride contains oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] . Oxymorphone hydrochloride may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of oxymorphone hydrochloride. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store oxymorphone hydrochloride in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other noncaregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.3 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including other opioids, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, and alcohol with oxymorphone may produce increased depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 5.4 Use in Patients with Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.5 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Use oxymorphone hydrochloride with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)] . Oxymorphone hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.7 Special Risk Groups Use oxymorphone hydrochloride with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Effects Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxymorphone hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Oxymorphone hydrochloride, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

Administer with extreme caution. (5.4) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.5) Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function (5.6) Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus. (5.8) Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.9) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.10) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. Respiratory depression may occur more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia, when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression, or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.2 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets contain oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other non-caregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.3 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including other opioids, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, and alcohol with oxymorphone may produce increased depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.5 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.5 )]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.7 Special Risk Groups Use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Effects Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.3) 7.1 Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets can result in an increase of oxymorphone plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone. Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 CNS Depressants The concomitant use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets with other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 7.3 Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol), and partial agonists (buprenorphine) may reduce the analgesic effect of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 7.4 Muscle Relaxants Oxymorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.5 Cimetidine Cimetidine can potentiate opioid-induced respiratory depression. Monitor patients for respiratory depression when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and cimetidine are used concurrently. 7.6 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed WARNINGS -Interaction with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If coadministration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive pharmacological effects. (5.4, 7.2) -Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) -Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.8) -Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.9) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain oxymorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxymorphone present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and monitor all patients receiving oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse, or misuse of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxymorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. Overestimating the oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets dose, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxymorphone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets is made, start with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets 5 mg every 12 hours, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and when oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment reduce the starting dose to the lowest dose and monitor for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 5.8 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with other GI obstruction. The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.11 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. 5.12 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonists and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gradually taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Do not abruptly discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.13 Driving and Operating Machinery Oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of oxymorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed WARNINGS Interaction with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If coadministration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive pharmacological effects. (5.4) Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.5, 5.6) Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.8) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of OPANA ER in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.9) Use with caution in patients who have difficulty in swallowing or have underlying GI disorders that may predispose them to obstruction. (5.10) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse OPANA ER contains oxymorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, OPANA ER exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as OPANA ER deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxymorphone present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OPANA ER and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing OPANA ER, and monitor all patients receiving OPANA ER for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of OPANA ER for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as OPANA ER, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OPANA ER along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of OPANA ER by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxymorphone and can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as OPANA ER are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OPANA ER. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OPANA ER, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with OPANA ER and following dose increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OPANA ER are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the OPANA ER dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OPANA ER, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxymorphone. 5.3 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of OPANA ER during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on OPANA ER therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with OPANA ER may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if OPANA ER is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of OPANA ER in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin OPANA ER is made, start with OPANA ER 5 mg every 12 hours, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.5 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OPANA ER and when OPANA ER is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with OPANA ER, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of OPANA ER may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study of OPANA ER in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In patients with mild hepatic impairment reduce the starting dose to the lowest dose and monitor for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 5.8 Hypotensive Effect OPANA ER may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of OPANA ER. In patients with circulatory shock, OPANA ER may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OPANA ER in patients with circulatory shock. 5.9 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure Monitor patients taking OPANA ER who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OPANA ER. OPANA ER may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OPANA ER in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.10 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen There have been post-marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing Opana ER tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick or otherwise wet Opana ER tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare post-marketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. 5.11 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. Avoid the use of OPANA ER in patients with other GI obstruction. The oxymorphone in OPANA ER may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. 5.12 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders The oxymorphone in OPANA ER may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OPANA ER therapy. 5.13 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including OPANA ER. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. When discontinuing OPANA ER, gradually taper the dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Do not abruptly discontinue OPANA ER. 5.14 Driving and Operating Machinery OPANA ER may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OPANA ER and know how they will react to the medication."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CNS depressants: Increased risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, coma or death. When combined therapy with CNS depressant is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. (7.1) Mixed agonist/antagonist opioids (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol): May reduce analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (7.2) Cimetidine: Combination use may precipitate confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures. (7.3) Anticholinergics: May result in urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. (7.4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Potentiate the action of opioids. Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.5) 7.1 Use with CNS Depressants The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol may produce additive CNS depressant effects. Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants because respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma and death may result and titrated slowly as necessary for adequate pain relief. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 7.2 Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as oxymorphone. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of oxymorphone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients. 7.3 Cimetidine CNS side effects have been reported (e.g., confusion, disorientation, respiratory depression, apnea, seizures) following coadministration of cimetidine with opioid analgesics; a causal relationship has not been established. 7.4 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. 7.5 MAO Inhibitors Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. No specific interaction between oxymorphone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been observed, but caution in the use of any opioid in patients taking this class of drugs is appropriate."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.1) Misuse, abuse, and diversion: Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. (5.2) CNS effects: Additive CNS-depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.3) Head injury: Effects may be markedly exaggerated. Administer with extreme caution. (5.4) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.5) Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function (5.6) Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus. (5.8) Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.9) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.10) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Respiratory depression may occur more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia, when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression, or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.2 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets contain oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ]. Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other non-caregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.3 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including other opioids, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, and alcohol with oxymorphone may produce increased depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.5 Hypotensive Effect Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. Use Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) ]. Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.7 Special Risk Groups Use Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Effects Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets are contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Respiratory depression: Increased risk in elderly, debilitated patients, and those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve. (5.1) Misuse, abuse, and diversion: OPANA is an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. (5.2) CNS effects: Additive CNS-depressive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs. (5.3) Head injury: Effects may be markedly exaggerated. Administer with extreme caution. (5.4) Hypotensive effect: Increased risk with compromised ability to maintain blood pressure. Administer with caution to patients in circulatory shock. (5.5) Mild hepatic impairment: Use with caution and at lower doses due to higher plasma concentrations than in patients with normal hepatic function (5.6) Prolonged gastric obstruction: May occur in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, especially paralytic ileus. (5.8) Sphincter of Oddi: Administer with caution in patients with biliary tract disease. (5.9) Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (5.10) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of OPANA. Respiratory depression may occur more frequently in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia, when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Administer OPANA with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, CNS depression, or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of oxymorphone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Consider alternative non-opioid analgesics and use OPANA only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. 5.2 Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids OPANA contains oxymorphone, a mu opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Oxymorphone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This issue should be considered when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. OPANA tablets may be abused by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the product. These practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. OPANA may be targeted for theft and diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their State Medical Board, State Board of Pharmacy, or State Control Board for information on how to detect or prevent diversion of this product, and security requirements for storing and handling of OPANA. Healthcare professionals should advise patients to store OPANA in a secure place, preferably locked and out of the reach of children and other non-caregivers. Concerns about abuse, misuse, diversion and addiction should not prevent the proper management of pain. 5.3 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of other CNS depressants including other opioids, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, and alcohol with oxymorphone may produce increased depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, coma and death [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure In the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure, the respiratory depressant effects of opioid analgesics and their potential to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated. Furthermore, opioid analgesics can produce effects on papillary response and consciousness, which may obscure neurologic signs of further increases in intracranial pressure in patients with head injuries. Administer OPANA with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.5 Hypotensive Effect OPANA, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension in a patient whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume, or after concurrent administration with drugs such as phenothiazines or other agents that compromise vasomotor tone. Administer OPANA with caution to patients in circulatory shock, since vasodilation produced by the drug may further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment A study of extended-release oxymorphone tablets in patients with hepatic disease indicated greater plasma concentrations than in those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use OPANA with caution in patients with mild impairment, starting with the lowest dose and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5)]. OPANA is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 5.7 Special Risk Groups Use OPANA with caution in the following conditions: adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease), prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture, severe impairment of pulmonary or renal function, and toxic psychosis. Opioids may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. 5.8 Gastrointestinal Effects Opioids diminish propulsive peristaltic waves in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitor for decreased bowel motility in post-operative patients receiving opioids. The administration of OPANA may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. OPANA is contraindicated in patients with paralytic ileus. 5.9 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease OPANA, like other opioids, may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and should be used with caution in patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis. 5.10 Driving and Operating Machinery Opioid analgesics impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery."
