        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with NAMENDA XR, specifically. Use with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution. (7.1) 7.1 Use with other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Antagonists The combined use of NAMENDA XR with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution. 7.2 Effect of Memantine on the Metabolism of Other Drugs In vitro studies conducted with marker substrates of CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, -2A6, -2C9, -2D6, -2E1, -3A4) showed minimal inhibition of these enzymes by memantine. In addition, in vitro studies indicate that at concentrations exceeding those associated with efficacy, memantine does not induce the cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP1A2, -2C9, -2E1 and -3A4/5. No pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes are expected. Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of memantine for interaction with donepezil (See Section 7.7 Use with Cholinesterase Inhibitors) and bupropion. Coadministration of memantine with the AChE inhibitor donepezil HCl does not affect the pharmacokinetics of either compound. Memantine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2B6 substrate bupropion or its metabolite hydroxybupropion. 7.3 Effect of Other Drugs on Memantine Memantine is predominantly renally eliminated, and drugs that are substrates and/or inhibitors of the CYP450 system are not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of memantine. A clinical drug-drug interaction study indicated that bupropion did not affect the pharmacokinetics of memantine. 7.4 Drugs Eliminated via Renal Mechanisms Because memantine is eliminated in part by tubular secretion, coadministration of drugs that use the same renal cationic system, including hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), triamterene (TA), metformin, cimetidine, ranitidine, quinidine, and nicotine, could potentially result in altered plasma levels of both agents. However, coadministration of memantine and HCTZ/TA did not affect the bioavailability of either memantine or TA, and the bioavailability of HCTZ decreased by 20%. In addition, coadministration of memantine with the antihyperglycemic drug Glucovance(R) (glyburide and metformin HCl) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of memantine, metformin and glyburide. Furthermore, memantine did not modify the serum glucose lowering effect of Glucovance(R), indicating the absence of a pharmacodynamic interaction. 7.5 Drugs That Make the Urine Alkaline The clearance of memantine was reduced by about 80% under alkaline urine conditions at pH 8. Therefore, alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse effects. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g. renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions. 7.6 Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins Because the plasma protein binding of memantine is low (45%), an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to plasma proteins, such as warfarin and digoxin, is unlikely [see Section 7.] 7.7 Use with Cholinesterase Inhibitors Coadministration of memantine with the AChE inhibitor donepezil HCl did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either compound. In a 24-week controlled clinical study in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, the adverse event profile observed with a combination of memantine immediate-release and donepezil was similar to that of donepezil alone."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly observed adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and greater than placebo with administration of NAMENDA XR 28 mg/day were headache, diarrhea and dizziness. Other less common and sometimes serious adverse events have been reported. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Contact Forest Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-678-1605 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Data Sources NAMENDA XR was evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial treating a total of 676 patients with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type (341 patients treated with NAMENDA XR 28 mg/day dose and 335 patients treated with placebo) for a treatment period up to 24 weeks. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 6.2 Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the placebo-controlled clinical trial of NAMENDA XR [See Clinical Studies (14 )], which treated a total of 676 patients, the proportion of patients in the NAMENDA XR 28 mg/day dose and placebo groups who discontinued treatment due to adverse events were 10.0% and 6.3%, respectively. The most common adverse reaction in the NAMENDA XR treated group that led to treatment discontinuation in this study was dizziness at a rate of 1.5%. 6.3 Most Common Adverse Reactions The most commonly observed adverse reactions seen in patients administered NAMENDA XR in the controlled clinical trial, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the NAMENDA XR group and at a higher frequency than placebo were headache, diarrhea and dizziness. Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that were observed at an incidence of >= 2% in the NAMENDA XR treated group and occurred at a rate greater than placebo.

There were no clinically important changes in vital signs in patients treated with NAMENDA XR. A comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures for NAMENDA XR and placebo in Alzheimer's patients indicated that NAMENDA XR treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes. 6.5 Laboratory Changes NAMENDA XR and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with NAMENDA XR treatment. 6.6 ECG Changes NAMENDA XR and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various ECG parameters and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in ECG parameters associated with NAMENDA XR treatment. 6.7 Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Trials of NAMENDA XR Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported from 750 patients treated with NAMENDA XR for periods up to 52 weeks in double-blind or open-label clinical trials. The listing does not include those events already listed in Table 1, those events for which a drug cause was remote, those events for which descriptive terms were so lacking in specificity as to be uninformative, and those events reported only once which did not have a substantial probability of being immediately life threatening. Events are categorized by body system. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: anemia. Cardiac Disorders: bradycardia, myocardial infarction. Gastrointestinal Disorders: fecal incontinence, nausea. General Disorders: asthenia, fatigue, gait disturbance, irritability, peripheral edema, pyrexia. Infections and Infestations: bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection. Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: fall. Investigations: weight decreased. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, dehydration, decreased appetite, hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: arthralgia, pain in extremity. Nervous System Disorders: convulsion, dementia Alzheimer's type, syncope, tremor. Psychiatric Disorders: agitation, confusional state, delirium, delusion, disorientation, hallucination, insomnia, restlessness. Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: cough, dyspnea. 6.8 Memantine Immediate Release Clinical Trial and Post Marketing Spontaneous Reports The following additional adverse reactions have been identified from previous worldwide experience with memantine (immediate release) use. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion because of a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to memantine and have not been listed elsewhere in labeling. However, because some of these adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship between their occurrence and the administration of memantine. These events include: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, leukopenia (including neutropenia), pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Cardiac Disorders: atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block (including 2nd and 3rd degree block), cardiac failure, orthostatic hypotension, and torsades de pointes. Endocrine Disorders: inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Gastrointestinal disorders: colitis, pancreatitis. General disorders and administration site conditions: malaise, sudden death. Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatitis (including abnormal hepatic function test, cytolytic and cholestatic hepatitis), hepatic failure. Infections and infestations: sepsis. Investigations: electrocardiogram QT prolonged, international normalized ratio increased. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia. Nervous System Disorders: convulsions (including grand mal), cerebrovascular accident, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal disorder, hypertonia, loss of consciousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, Parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, transient ischemic attack. Psychiatric Disorders: hallucinations (both visual and auditory), restlessness, suicidal ideation. Renal and Urinary Disorders: acute renal failure (including abnormal renal function test), urinary retention. Skin Disorders: rash, Stevens Johnson syndrome. Vascular Disorders: pulmonary embolism, thrombophlebitis, deep venous thrombosis. The following adverse events have been reported to be temporally associated with memantine treatment and are not described elsewhere in the product labeling: aspiration pneumonia, bone fracture, carpal tunnel syndrome, cerebral infarction, chest pain, cholelithiasis, claudication, depressed level of consciousness (including rare reports of coma), dysphagia, encephalopathy, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux, intracranial hemorrhage, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, ileus, impotence, lethargy, myoclonus, supraventricular tachycardia, and tachycardia. However, there is again no evidence that any of these additional adverse events are caused by memantine."

These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion because of a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to memantine and have not been listed elsewhere in labeling. However, because some of these adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship between their occurrence and the administration of memantine. These events include: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, leukopenia (including neutropenia), pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Cardiac Disorders: atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block (including 2nd and 3rd degree block), cardiac failure, orthostatic hypotension, and torsades de pointes.

Nervous System Disorders: convulsions (including grand mal), cerebrovascular accident, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal disorder, hypertonia, loss of consciousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, Parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, transient ischemic attack. Psychiatric Disorders: hallucinations (both visual and auditory), restlessness, suicidal ideation. Renal and Urinary Disorders: acute renal failure (including abnormal renal function test), urinary retention. Skin Disorders: rash, Stevens Johnson syndrome. Vascular Disorders: pulmonary embolism, thrombophlebitis, deep venous thrombosis.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Combined use with NMDA antagonists: use with caution (7.2) NAMZARIC may interfere with anticholinergic medications (7.4) Concomitant administration of succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists may lead to synergistic effect (7.5) 7.1 Use of Memantine with Drugs That Make the Urine Alkaline The clearance of memantine was reduced by about 80% under alkaline urine conditions at pH 8. Therefore, alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse reactions. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g., renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions. 7.2 Use of Memantine with Other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Antagonists The combined use of memantine hydrochloride with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution. 7.3 Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) and CYP2D6 (e.g., quinidine), inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. Inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil. 7.4 Use of Donepezil with Anticholinergics Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil hydrochloride, have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications. 7.5 Use of Donepezil with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil hydrochloride, are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling. Cardiovascular Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Peptic Ulcer Disease and Gastrointestinal Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Genitourinary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Pulmonary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] The most common adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and greater than placebo with memantine hydrochloride extended-release 28 mg/day were headache, diarrhea, and dizziness (6.1) The most common adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil and at twice or more the placebo rate, include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Forest Laboratories, LLC. at 1-800-678-1605 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Memantine Hydrochloride Memantine hydrochloride extended-release was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 676 patients with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type (341 patients treated with memantine 28 mg/day dose and 335 patients treated with placebo) for a treatment period up to 24 weeks. Of the patients randomized, 236 treated with memantine 28 mg/day and 227 treated with placebo were on a stable dose of donepezil for 3 months prior to screening. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation with Memantine Hydrochloride In the placebo-controlled clinical trial of memantine hydrochloride extended-release, the proportion of patients in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release 28 mg/day dose group and in the placebo group who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 10% and 6%, respectively. The most common adverse reaction in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release treated group that led to treatment discontinuation was dizziness, at a rate of 1.5%. Most Common Adverse Reactions with Memantine Hydrochloride The most common adverse reactions with memantine hydrochloride extended-release in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release group and at a higher frequency than placebo, were headache, diarrhea, and dizziness. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of >= 2% in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release treated group and occurred at a rate greater than placebo.

The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen with placebo, were anorexia (2%), nausea (2%), diarrhea (2%) and urinary tract infection (2%). Most Common Adverse Reactions with Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse reactions reported with donepezil hydrochloride in controlled clinical trials in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the donepezil hydrochloride group and at twice or more the placebo rate, were diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions reported with donepezil hydrochloride in controlled clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease were insomnia, muscle cramp, and fatigue. Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of >= 2% in the donepezil hydrochloride group and at a rate greater than placebo in controlled trials in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS NAMZARIC is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia (5.1) NAMZARIC may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block (5.2) Monitor patients for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers (5.3) NAMZARIC can cause diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting (5.4) NAMZARIC may cause bladder outflow obstructions (5.5) Conditions that raise urine pH may decrease the urinary elimination of memantine, resulting in increased plasma levels of memantine (5.5, 7.1) 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride. 5.3 Peptic Ulcer Disease and Gastrointestinal Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients treated with NAMZARIC should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 5.4 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, when initiated, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment. 5.5 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. Conditions that raise urine pH may decrease the urinary elimination of memantine resulting in increased plasma levels of memantine [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Seizures Cholinomimetics, including donepezil hydrochloride, are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. 5.7 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease."
