If superinfection occurs, discontinue use and institute alternative therapy. Whenever clinical judgment dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and where appropriate, fluorescein staining. 5.3 Avoidance of Contact Lens Wear Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis or during the course of therapy with ZYMAXID(R) (see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION, 17.2)."
