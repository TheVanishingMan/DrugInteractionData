        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The major hazards of meperidine, as with other narcotic analgesics, are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression; respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest have occurred. The most frequently observed adverse reactions include light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not experiencing severe pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable. Some adverse reactions in ambulatory patients may be alleviated if the patient lies down. Other adverse reactions include Central Nervous System: Euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, headache, agitation, tremor, uncoordinated muscle movements, transient hallucinations and disorientation, visual disturbances and, rarely, extrapyramidal reactions. Gastrointestinal: Dry mouth, constipation, biliary-tract spasm. Cardiovascular: Flushing of the face, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, syncope. Promethazine adverse reactions Central Nervous System: Drowsiness is the most prominent CNS effect of this drug. Sedation, somnolence, blurred vision, dizziness; confusion, disorientation, and extrapyramidal symptoms such as oculogyric crisis, torticollis, and tongue protrusion; lassitude, tinnitus, incoordination, fatigue, euphoria, nervousness, diplopia, insomnia, tremors, convulsive seizures, excitation, catatonic-like states, hysteria. Hallucinations have also been reported. Cardiovascular: Increased or decreased blood pressure, tachycardia, bradycardia, faintness. Dermatologic: Dermatitis, photosensitivity, urticaria. Hematologic: Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, agranulocytosis. Gastrointestinal: Dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, jaundice. Respiratory: Asthma, nasal stuffiness, respiratory depression (potentially fatal) and apnea (potentially fatal). Other: Angioneurotic edema. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (potentially fatal) has also been reported. Paradoxical Reactions: Hyperexcitability and abnormal movements have been reported in patients following a single administration of promethazine hydrochloride. Consideration should be given to the discontinuation of promethazine hydrochloride and to the use of other drugs if these reactions occur. Respiratory depression, nightmares, delirium, and agitated behavior have also been reported in some of these patients. Minor increases in blood pressure and occasional mild hypotension have been detected. This is not a complete list of possible side effects.
