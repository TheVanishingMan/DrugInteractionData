        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coadministration of didanosine delayed-release capsules can alter the concentration of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of didanosine. The potential drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (4, 7, 12.3) 7.1 Established Drug Interactions Clinical recommendations based on the results of drug interaction studies are listed in Table 5. Pharmacokinetic results of drug interaction studies are shown in Tables 9 to 12 [see Contraindications (4.1 and 4.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Table 5: Established Drug Interactions Based on Studies with Didanosine Delayed-Release Capsules or Studies with Buffered Formulations of Didanosine and Expected to Occur with Didanosine Delayed-Release Capsules Drug Effect Clinical Comment ganciclovir |didanosine concentration If there is no suitable alternative to ganciclovir, then use in combination with didanosine delayed-release capsules with caution. Monitor for didanosine-associated toxicity. methadone |didanosine concentration If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of didanosine is didanosine delayed-release capsules. Patients should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when didanosine delayed-release capsules are coadministered with methadone, including monitoring for changes in HIV RNA viral load. Do not coadminister methadone with didanosine pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations. nelfinavir No interaction 1 hour after didanosine Administer nelfinavir 1 hour after didanosine delayed-release capsules. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate |didanosine concentration A dose reduction of didanosine delayed-release capsules to the following dosage once daily taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kcalories or less and 20% fat or less ) or in the fasted state is recommended.a -250 mg (adults weighing at least 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min) -200 mg (adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min) Patients should be monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities and clinical response. | Indicates increase. | Indicates decrease. a Coadministration of didanosine with food decreases didanosine concentrations. Thus, although not studied, it is possible that coadministration with heavier meals could reduce didanosine concentrations further. Exposure to didanosine is increased when coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Table 5 and see Clinical Pharmacokinetics (12.3, Tables 9 and 10)]. Increased exposure may cause or worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine delayed-release capsules should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. Didanosine delayed-release capsules should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis develop [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily. 7.2 Predicted Drug Interactions Predicted drug interactions with didanosine delayed-release capsules are listed in Table 6.

Adults Study AI454-152 was a 48-week, randomized, open-label study comparing didanosine delayed-release capsules (400 mg once daily) plus stavudine (40 mg twice daily) plus nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) to zidovudine (300 mg) plus lamivudine (150 mg) combination tablets twice daily plus nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) in 511 treatment-naive patients. Selected clinical adverse reactions that occurred in combination with other antiretroviral agents are provided in Table 3. Table 3: Selected Clinical Adverse Reactions, Study AI454-152a Percent of Patientsb,c Adverse Reactions didanosine delayed-release capsules + stavudine + nelfinavir n = 258 zidovudine/ lamivudined+ nelfinavir n = 253 Diarrhea 57 58 Peripheral Neurologic Symptoms/Neuropathy 25 11 Nausea 24 36 Headache 22 17 Rash 14 12 Vomiting 14 19 Pancreatitis (see below) less than 1 * a Median duration of treatment was 62 weeks in the didanosine delayed-release capsules + stavudine + nelfinavir group and 61 weeks in the zidovudine/lamivudine + nelfinavir group. b Percentages based on treated patients. c The incidences reported included all severity grades and all reactions regardless of causality. d Zidovudine/lamivudine combination tablet. * This event was not observed in this study arm. In clinical trials using a buffered formulation of didanosine, pancreatitis resulting in death was observed in one patient who received didanosine plus stavudine plus nelfinavir, one patient who received didanosine plus stavudine plus indinavir, and 2 of 68 patients who received didanosine plus stavudine plus indinavir plus hydroxyurea. In an early access program, pancreatitis resulting in death was observed in one patient who received didanosine delayed-release capsules plus stavudine plus hydroxyurea plus ritonavir plus indinavir plus efavirenz [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related. In phase 3 studies with buffered formulations of didanosine, incidence ranged from 1% to 10% with doses higher than are currently recommended and 1% to 7% with recommended dose. Selected laboratory abnormalities that occurred in a study of didanosine delayed-release capsules in combination with other antiretroviral agents are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Selected Laboratory Abnormalities, Study AI454-152a Percent of Patientsb didanosine delayed-release capsules + stavudine + nelfinavir n = 258 zidovudine/lamivudinec + nelfinavir n = 253 Parameter Grades 3 to 4d All Grades Grades 3 to 4d All Grades SGOT (AST) 5 46 5 19 SGPT (ALT) 6 44 5 22 Lipase 5 23 2 13 Bilirubin less than 1 9 less than 1 3 a Median duration of treatment was 62 weeks in the didanosine delayed-release capsules + stavudine + nelfinavir group and 61 weeks in the zidovudine/lamivudine + nelfinavir group. b Percentages based on treated patients. c Zidovudine/lamivudine combination tablet. d Greater than 5 x ULN for SGOT and SGPT, at least 2.1 x ULN for lipase, and at least 2.6 x ULN for bilirubin (ULN = upper limit of normal). Pediatric Patients In clinical trials, 743 pediatric patients between 2 weeks and 18 years of age have been treated with didanosine. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in these patients were generally consistent with the safety profile of didanosine in adults. In pediatric phase 1 studies, pancreatitis occurred in 2 of 60 (3%) patients treated at entry doses below 300 mg/m2/day and in 5 of 38 (13%) patients treated at higher doses. In study ACTG 152, pancreatitis occurred in none of the 281 pediatric patients who received didanosine 120 mg/m2 every 12 hours and in less than 1% of the 274 pediatric patients who received didanosine 90 mg/m2 every 12 hours in combination with zidovudine [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in pediatric patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of didanosine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to didanosine, or a combination of these factors. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders - anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Body as a Whole - abdominal pain, alopecia, anaphylactoid reaction, asthenia, chills/fever, pain, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Digestive Disorders - anorexia, dyspepsia, and flatulence. Exocrine Gland Disorders - pancreatitis (including fatal cases) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], sialoadenitis, parotid gland enlargement, dry mouth, and dry eyes. Hepatobiliary Disorders - symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]; non-cirrhotic portal hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]; hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders - diabetes mellitus, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level, elevated serum amylase level, elevated serum gamma-glutamyltransferase level, elevated serum uric acid level, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal Disorders - myalgia (with or without increases in creatine kinase), rhabdomyolysis including acute renal failure and hemodialysis, arthralgia, and myopathy. Ophthalmologic Disorders - retinal depigmentation and optic neuritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Use with Stavudine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When didanosine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when didanosine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with didanosine delayed-release capsules in combination with stavudine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The combination of didanosine delayed-release capsules and hydroxyurea, with or without stavudine, should be avoided."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Pancreatitis: Suspension or discontinuation of didanosine may be necessary. (5.1) -Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Suspend didanosine in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.2) -Hepatic toxicity: Interruption or discontinuation of didanosine must be considered upon worsening of liver disease. (5.3) -Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension: Discontinue didanosine in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. (5.4) -Patients may develop peripheral neuropathy (5.5), retinal changes and optic neuritis (5.6), immune reconstitution syndrome (5.7), and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.8) 5.1 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis has occurred during therapy with didanosine used alone or in combination regimens in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. Didanosine delayed-release capsules should be suspended in patients with signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis. Patients treated with didanosine delayed-release capsules in combination with stavudine may be at increased risk for pancreatitis. When treatment with life-sustaining drugs known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, suspension of didanosine delayed-release capsules therapy is recommended. In patients with risk factors for pancreatitis, didanosine delayed-release capsules should be used with extreme caution and only if clearly indicated. Patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, especially the elderly, are at increased risk of pancreatitis and should be followed closely. Patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for pancreatitis if treated without dose adjustment. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.2 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of didanosine and stavudine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering didanosine delayed-release capsules to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with didanosine delayed-release capsules should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical signs or symptoms with or without laboratory findings consistent with symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of didanosine delayed-release capsules have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Non-cirrhotic Portal Hypertension Postmarketing cases of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension have been reported, including cases leading to liver transplantation or death. Cases of didanosine-associated non-cirrhotic portal hypertension were confirmed by liver biopsy in patients with no evidence of viral hepatitis. Onset of signs and symptoms ranged from months to years after start of didanosine therapy. Common presenting features included elevated liver enzymes, esophageal varices, hematemesis, ascites, and splenomegaly. Patients receiving didanosine delayed-release capsules should be monitored for early signs of portal hypertension (e.g., thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly) during routine medical visits. Appropriate laboratory testing including liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, albumin, complete blood count, and international normalized ratio (INR) and ultrasonography should be considered. Didanosine delayed-release capsules should be discontinued in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. 5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving didanosine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy, including stavudine. Discontinuation of didanosine delayed-release capsules should be considered in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.6 Retinal Changes and Optic Neuritis Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in patients taking didanosine. Periodic retinal examinations should be considered for patients receiving didanosine delayed-release capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including didanosine delayed-release capsules. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Cases of didanosine-associated non-cirrhotic portal hypertension were confirmed by liver biopsy in patients with no evidence of viral hepatitis. Onset of signs and symptoms ranged from months to years after start of didanosine therapy. Common presenting features included elevated liver enzymes, esophageal varices, hematemesis, ascites, and splenomegaly. Patients receiving VIDEX EC should be monitored for early signs of portal hypertension (eg, thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly) during routine medical visits. Appropriate laboratory testing including liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, albumin, complete blood count, and international normalized ratio (INR) and ultrasonography should be considered. VIDEX EC should be discontinued in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. 5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving didanosine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy, including stavudine. Discontinuation of VIDEX EC should be considered in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy. [See Adverse Reactions (6) .] 5.6 Retinal Changes and Optic Neuritis Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in patients taking didanosine. Periodic retinal examinations should be considered for patients receiving VIDEX EC [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIDEX EC. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.",

The potential drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (4, 7, 12.3) 7.1 Established Drug Interactions Clinical recommendations based on the results of drug interaction studies are listed in Table 5. Pharmacokinetic results of drug interaction studies are shown in Tables 9 to 12 [see Contraindications (4.1 and 4.2),Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 5: Established Drug Interactions Based on Studies with Didanosine Delayed-release Capsules or Studies with Buffered Formulations of Didanosine and Expected to Occur with Didanosine Delayed-release Capsules Drug Effect Clinical Comment ganciclovir | didanosine concentration If there is no suitable alternative to ganciclovir, then use in combination with didanosine with caution. Monitor for didanosine-associated toxicity. methadone | didanosine concentration If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of didanosine is didanosine delayed-release capsules. Patients should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when didanosine is coadministered with methadone, including monitoring for changes in HIV RNA viral load. Do not coadminister methadone with didanosine pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations. nelfinavir No interaction one hour after didanosine Administer nelfinavir one hour after didanosine. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate | didanosine concentration A dose reduction of didanosine to the following dosage once daily taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kcalories or less and 20% fat or less) or in the fasted state is recommended.Coadministration of didanosine with food decreases didanosine concentrations. Thus, although not studied, it is possible that coadministration with heavier meals could reduce didanosine concentrations further. -250 mg (adults weighing at least 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min) -200 mg (adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min) Patients should be monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities and clinical response. | Indicates increase. | Indicates decrease. Exposure to didanosine is increased when coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Table 5 and see Clinical Pharmacokinetics (12.3, Tables 9 and 10) ]. Increased exposure may cause or worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. Didanosine should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis develop [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily. 7.2 Predicted Drug Interactions Predicted drug interactions with didanosine are listed in Table 6.

(6.1) -Adverse reactions in pediatric patients were consistent with those in adults. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults Study AI454-152 was a 48-week, randomized, open-label study comparing didanosine (400 mg once daily) plus stavudine (40 mg twice daily) plus nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) to zidovudine (300 mg) plus lamivudine (150 mg) combination tablets twice daily plus nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) in 511 treatment-naive patients. Selected clinical adverse reactions that occurred in combination with other antiretroviral agents are provided in Table 3. Table 3: Selected Clinical Adverse Reactions, Study AI454-152Median duration of treatment was 62 weeks in the didanosine + stavudine + nelfinavir group and 61 weeks in the zidovudine/lamivudine + nelfinavir group. Adverse Events Percent of Patients Percentages based on treated patients. , The incidences reported included all severity grades and all reactions regardless of causality. didanosine + stavudine + nelfinavir n = 258 zidovudine/ lamivudine Zidovudine/lamivudine combination tablet. + nelfinavir n = 253 Diarrhea 57 58 Peripheral Neurologic Symptoms/Neuropathy 25 11 Nausea 24 36 Headache 22 17 Rash 14 12 Vomiting 14 19 Pancreatitis (see below) less than 1 This event was not observed in this study arm. In clinical trials using a buffered formulation of didanosine, pancreatitis resulting in death was observed in one patient who received didanosine plus stavudine plus nelfinavir, one patient who received didanosine plus stavudine plus indinavir, and 2 of 68 patients who received didanosine plus stavudine plus indinavir plus hydroxyurea. In an early access program, pancreatitis resulting in death was observed in one patient who received didanosine plus stavudine plus hydroxyurea plus ritonavir plus indinavir plus efavirenz [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related. In phase 3 studies with buffered formulations of didanosine, incidence ranged from 1% to 10% with doses higher than are currently recommended and 1% to 7% with recommended dose. Selected laboratory abnormalities that occurred in a study of didanosine in combination with other antiretroviral agents are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Selected Laboratory Abnormalities, Study AI454-152Median duration of treatment was 62 weeks in the didanosine + stavudine + nelfinavir group and 61 weeks in the zidovudine/lamivudine + nelfinavir group.

Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in these patients were generally consistent with the safety profile of didanosine in adults. In pediatric phase 1 studies, pancreatitis occurred in 2 of 60 (3%) patients treated at entry doses below 300 mg/m2/day and in 5 of 38 (13%) patients treated at higher doses. In study ACTG 152, pancreatitis occurred in none of the 281 pediatric patients who received didanosine 120 mg/m2 every 12 hours and in less than 1% of the 274 pediatric patients who received didanosine 90 mg/m2 every 12 hours in combination with zidovudine [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in pediatric patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of didanosine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to didanosine, or a combination of these factors. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, alopecia, anaphylactoid reaction, asthenia, chills/fever, pain, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Digestive Disorders: anorexia, dyspepsia, and flatulence. Exocrine Gland Disorders: pancreatitis (including fatal cases) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], sialoadenitis, parotid gland enlargement, dry mouth, and dry eyes. Hepatobiliary Disorders: symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]; non-cirrhotic portal hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]; hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders: diabetes mellitus, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level, elevated serum amylase level, elevated serum gamma-glutamyltransferase level, elevated serum uric acid level, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal Disorders: myalgia (with or without increases in creatine kinase), rhabdomyolysis including acute renal failure and hemodialysis, arthralgia, and myopathy. Ophthalmologic Disorders: retinal depigmentation and optic neuritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Use with Stavudine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When didanosine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when didanosine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with didanosine in combination with stavudine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. The combination of didanosine and hydroxyurea, with or without stavudine, should be avoided."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Pancreatitis: Suspension or discontinuation of didanosine may be necessary. (5.1) -Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Suspend didanosine in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.2) -Hepatic toxicity: Interruption or discontinuation of didanosine must be considered upon worsening of liver disease. (5.3) -Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension: Discontinue didanosine in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. (5.4) -Patients may develop peripheral neuropathy (5.5), retinal changes and optic neuritis (5.6), immune reconstitution syndrome (5.7), and redistribution/accumulation of body fat. (5.8) 5.1 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis has occurred during therapy with didanosine used alone or in combination regimens in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. Didanosine should be suspended in patients with signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis. Patients treated with didanosine in combination with stavudine may be at increased risk for pancreatitis. When treatment with life-sustaining drugs known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, suspension of didanosine therapy is recommended. In patients with risk factors for pancreatitis, didanosine should be used with extreme caution and only if clearly indicated. Patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, especially the elderly, are at increased risk of pancreatitis and should be followed closely. Patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for pancreatitis if treated without dose adjustment. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] 5.2 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of didanosine and stavudine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering didanosine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with didanosine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical signs or symptoms with or without laboratory findings consistent with symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of didanosine have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] 5.4 Non-cirrhotic Portal Hypertension Postmarketing cases of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension have been reported, including cases leading to liver transplantation or death. Cases of didanosine-associated non-cirrhotic portal hypertension were confirmed by liver biopsy in patients with no evidence of viral hepatitis. Onset of signs and symptoms ranged from months to years after start of didanosine therapy. Common presenting features included elevated liver enzymes, esophageal varices, hematemesis, ascites, and splenomegaly. Patients receiving didanosine should be monitored for early signs of portal hypertension (e.g., thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly) during routine medical visits. Appropriate laboratory testing including liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, albumin, complete blood count, and international normalized ratio (INR) and ultrasonography should be considered. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. 5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving didanosine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy, including stavudine. Discontinuation of didanosine should be considered in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] 5.6 Retinal Changes and Optic Neuritis Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in patients taking didanosine. Periodic retinal examinations should be considered for patients receiving didanosine [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including didanosine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

The combination of didanosine and stavudine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering didanosine delayed-release capsules to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with didanosine delayed-release capsules should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical signs or symptoms with or without laboratory findings consistent with symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of didanosine delayed-release capsules have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Non-cirrhotic Portal Hypertension Postmarketing cases of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension have been reported, including cases leading to liver transplantation or death. Cases of didanosine-associated non-cirrhotic portal hypertension were confirmed by liver biopsy in patients with no evidence of viral hepatitis. Onset of signs and symptoms ranged from months to years after start of didanosine therapy. Common presenting features included elevated liver enzymes, esophageal varices, hematemesis, ascites, and splenomegaly. Patients receiving didanosine delayed-release capsules should be monitored for early signs of portal hypertension (eg, thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly) during routine medical visits. Appropriate laboratory testing including liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, albumin, complete blood count, and international normalized ratio (INR) and ultrasonography should be considered. Didanosine delayed-release capsules should be discontinued in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. 5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving didanosine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy, including stavudine. Discontinuation of didanosine delayed-release capsules should be considered in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.6 Retinal Changes and Optic Neuritis Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in patients taking didanosine. Periodic retinal examinations should be considered for patients receiving didanosine delayed-release capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including didanosine delayed-release capsules. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coadministration of didanosine delayed-release capsules can alter the concentration of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of didanosine. The potential drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (4, 7, 12.3) 7.1 Established Drug Interactions Clinical recommendations based on the results of drug interaction studies are listed in Table 5. Pharmacokinetic results of drug interaction studies are shown in Tables 9 to 12 [see Contraindications (4.1 and 4.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Table 5: Established Drug Interactions Based on Studies with Didanosine Delayed-Release Capsules or Studies with Buffered Formulations of Didanosine and Expected to Occur with Didanosine Delayed-Release Capsules Drug Effect Clinical Comment | Indicates increase. | Indicates decrease. a Coadministration of didanosine with food decreases didanosine concentrations. Thus, although not studied, it is possible that coadministration with heavier meals could reduce didanosine concentrations further. ganciclovir | didanosine concentration If there is no suitable alternative to ganciclovir, then use in combination with didanosine delayed-release capsules with caution. Monitor for didanosine- associated toxicity. methadone | didanosine concentration If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of didanosine is didanosine delayed-release capsules. Patients should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when didanosine delayed-release capsules is coadministered with methadone, including monitoring for changes in HIV RNA viral load. Do not coadminister methadone with didanosine pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations. nelfinavir No interaction 1 hour after didanosine Administer nelfinavir 1 hour after didanosine delayed-release capsules. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate | didanosine concentration A dose reduction of didanosine delayed-release capsules to the following dosage once daily taken together with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a light meal (400 kcalories or less and 20% fat or less) or in the fasted state is recommended.a 250 mg (adults weighing at least 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min) 200 mg (adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min) Patients should be monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities and clinical response. Exposure to didanosine is increased when coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Table 5 and see Clinical Pharmacokinetics (12.3, Tables 9 and 10) ]. Increased exposure may cause or worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine delayed-release capsules should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. Didanosine delayed-release capsules should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis develop [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily. 7.2 Predicted Drug Interactions Predicted drug interactions with didanosine delayed-release capsules are listed in Table 6. Table 6: Predicted Drug Interactions with Didanosine Delayed-Release Capsules Drug or Drug Class Effect Clinical Comment | Indicates increase. a Only if other drugs are not available and if clearly indicated.

Adults Study AI454-152 was a 48-week, randomized, open-label study comparing didanosine delayed-release capsules (400 mg once daily) plus stavudine (40 mg twice daily) plus nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) to zidovudine (300 mg) plus lamivudine (150 mg) combination tablets twice daily plus nelfinavir (750 mg three times daily) in 511 treatment-naive patients. Selected clinical adverse reactions that occurred in combination with other antiretroviral agents are provided in Table 3.

In an early access program, pancreatitis resulting in death was observed in one patient who received didanosine delayed-release capsules plus stavudine plus hydroxyurea plus ritonavir plus indinavir plus efavirenz [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related. In phase 3 studies with buffered formulations of didanosine, incidence ranged from 1% to 10% with doses higher than are currently recommended and 1% to 7% with recommended dose. Selected laboratory abnormalities that occurred in a study of didanosine delayed-release capsules in combination with other antiretroviral agents are shown in Table 4.

Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in these patients were generally consistent with the safety profile of didanosine in adults. In pediatric phase 1 studies, pancreatitis occurred in 2 of 60 (3%) patients treated at entry doses below 300 mg/m2/day and in 5 of 38 (13%) patients treated at higher doses. In study ACTG 152, pancreatitis occurred in none of the 281 pediatric patients who received didanosine 120 mg/m2 every 12 hours and in less than 1% of the 274 pediatric patients who received didanosine 90 mg/m2 every 12 hours in combination with zidovudine [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in pediatric patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of didanosine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to didanosine, or a combination of these factors. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders - anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Body as a Whole - abdominal pain, alopecia, anaphylactoid reaction, asthenia, chills/fever, pain, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Digestive Disorders - anorexia, dyspepsia, and flatulence. Exocrine Gland Disorders - pancreatitis (including fatal cases) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], sialoadenitis, parotid gland enlargement, dry mouth, and dry eyes. Hepatobiliary Disorders - symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]; non-cirrhotic portal hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]; hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders - diabetes mellitus, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level, elevated serum amylase level, elevated serum gamma-glutamyltransferase level, elevated serum uric acid level, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal Disorders - myalgia (with or without increases in creatine kinase), rhabdomyolysis including acute renal failure and hemodialysis, arthralgia, and myopathy. Ophthalmologic Disorders - retinal depigmentation and optic neuritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Use with Stavudine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When didanosine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when didanosine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with didanosine delayed-release capsules in combination with stavudine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The combination of didanosine delayed-release capsules and hydroxyurea, with or without stavudine, should be avoided."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: Suspension or discontinuation of didanosine may be necessary. (5.1) Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Suspend didanosine in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.2) Hepatic toxicity: Interruption or discontinuation of didanosine must be considered upon worsening of liver disease. (5.3) Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension: Discontinue didanosine in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. (5.4) Patients may develop peripheral neuropathy (5.5), retinal changes and optic neuritis (5.6), immune reconstitution syndrome (5.7), and redistribution/accumulation of body fat. (5.8) 5.1 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis has occurred during therapy with didanosine used alone or in combination regimens in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. Didanosine delayed-release capsules should be suspended in patients with signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis. Patients treated with didanosine delayed-release capsules in combination with stavudine may be at increased risk for pancreatitis. When treatment with life-sustaining drugs known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, suspension of didanosine delayed-release capsules therapy is recommended. In patients with risk factors for pancreatitis, didanosine delayed-release capsules should be used with extreme caution and only if clearly indicated. Patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, especially the elderly, are at increased risk of pancreatitis and should be followed closely. Patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for pancreatitis if treated without dose adjustment. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] 5.2 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of didanosine and stavudine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering didanosine delayed-release capsules to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with didanosine delayed-release capsules should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical signs or symptoms with or without laboratory findings consistent with symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of didanosine delayed-release capsules have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] 5.4 Non-cirrhotic Portal Hypertension Postmarketing cases of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension have been reported, including cases leading to liver transplantation or death. Cases of didanosine-associated non-cirrhotic portal hypertension were confirmed by liver biopsy in patients with no evidence of viral hepatitis. Onset of signs and symptoms ranged from months to years after start of didanosine therapy. Common presenting features included elevated liver enzymes, esophageal varices, hematemesis, ascites, and splenomegaly. Patients receiving didanosine delayed-release capsules should be monitored for early signs of portal hypertension (e.g., thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly) during routine medical visits. Appropriate laboratory testing including liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, albumin, complete blood count, and international normalized ratio (INR) and ultrasonography should be considered. Didanosine delayed-release capsules should be discontinued in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. 5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving didanosine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy, including stavudine. Discontinuation of didanosine delayed-release capsules should be considered in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] 5.6 Retinal Changes and Optic Neuritis Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in patients taking didanosine. Periodic retinal examinations should be considered for patients receiving didanosine delayed-release capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including didanosine delayed-release capsules. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Thus, patients treated with didanosine in combination with stavudine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The combination of didanosine and hydroxyurea, with or without stavudine, should be avoided."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: Suspension or discontinuation of didanosine may be necessary. (5.1 ) Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Suspend didanosine in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.2 ) Hepatic toxicity: Interruption or discontinuation or didanosine must be considered upon worsening of liver disease. (5.3) Patients may develop peripheral neuropathy (5.4), retinal changes and optic neuritis (5.5), immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6), and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) 5.1 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis has occurred during therapy with didanosine used alone or in combination regimens in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. Didanosine should be suspended in patients with signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis. Patients treated with didanosine in combination with stavudine may be at increased risk for pancreatitis. When treatment with life-sustaining drugs known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, suspension of didanosine therapy is recommended. In patients with risk factors for pancreatitis, didanosine should be used with extreme caution and only if clearly indicated. Patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, especially the elderly, are at increased risk of pancreatitis and should be followed closely. Patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for pancreatitis if treated without dose adjustment. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.2 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of didanosine and stavudine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering didanosine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with didanosine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical signs or symptoms with or without laboratory findings consistent with symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of didanosine have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided [see Adverse Reactions (6 )]. 5.4 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving didanosine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy, including stavudine. Discontinuation of didanosine should be considered in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.5 Retinal Changes and Optic Neuritis Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in patients taking didanosine. Periodic retinal examinations should be considered for patients receiving didanosine [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including didanosine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coadministration of VIDEX can alter the concentration of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of didanosine. The potential drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (4, 7, 12.3) 7.1 Established Drug Interactions Clinical recommendations based on the results of drug interaction studies are listed in Table 8. Pharmacokinetic results of drug interaction studies are shown in Tables 12 and 13 [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 8: Established Drug Interactions with VIDEX Drug Effect Clinical Comment | Indicates increase. | Indicates decrease. a The dosing recommendation for coadministration of VIDEX EC and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with respect to meal consumption differs from that of VIDEX. See the complete prescribing information for VIDEX EC. ciprofloxacin | ciprofloxacin concentration Administer VIDEX at least 2 hours after or 6 hours before ciprofloxacin. delavirdine | delavirdine concentration Administer VIDEX 1 hour after delavirdine. ganciclovir | didanosine concentration If there is no suitable alternative to ganciclovir, then use in combination with VIDEX with caution. Monitor for didanosine-associated toxicity. indinavir | indinavir concentration Administer VIDEX 1 hour after indinavir. methadone | didanosine concentration Do not coadminister methadone with VIDEX pediatric powder due to significant decreases in didanosine concentrations. If coadministration of methadone and didanosine is necessary, the recommended formulation of didanosine is VIDEX EC. Patients should be closely monitored for adequate clinical response when VIDEX EC is coadministered with methadone, including monitoring for changes in HIV RNA viral load. nelfinavir No interaction 1 hour after didanosine Administer nelfinavir 1 hour after VIDEX. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate | didanosine concentration A dose reduction of VIDEX to the following dosage once daily is recommended.a -250 mg (adults weighing at least 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min) -200 mg (adults weighing less than 60 kg with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min) VIDEX and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may be taken together in the fasted state. If tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is taken with food, VIDEX should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 30 minutes before food or 2 hours after food). Patients should be monitored for didanosine-associated toxicities and clinical response. Exposure to didanosine is increased when coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Increased exposure may cause or worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with VIDEX should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. VIDEX should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis develop [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily. 7.2 Predicted Drug Interactions Predicted drug interactions with VIDEX are listed in Table 9. Table 9: Predicted Drug Interactions with VIDEX Drug or Drug Class Effect Clinical Comment | Indicates increase. | Indicates decrease. a Only if other drugs are not available and if clearly indicated.

Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in these patients were generally consistent with the safety profile of didanosine in adults. In pediatric phase 1 studies, pancreatitis occurred in 2 of 60 (3%) patients treated at entry doses below 300 mg per m2 per day and in 5 of 38 (13%) patients treated at higher doses. In study ACTG 152, pancreatitis occurred in none of the 281 pediatric patients who received didanosine 120 mg per m2 every 12 hours and in less than 1% of the 274 pediatric patients who received didanosine 90 mg per m2 every 12 hours in combination with zidovudine [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in pediatric patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of didanosine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to VIDEX, or a combination of these factors. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders - anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Body as a Whole - alopecia, anaphylactoid reaction, asthenia, chills/fever, pain, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Digestive Disorders - anorexia, dyspepsia, and flatulence. Exocrine Gland Disorders - pancreatitis (including fatal cases) [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], sialadenitis, parotid gland enlargement, dry mouth, and dry eyes. Hepatobiliary Disorders - symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]; non-cirrhotic portal hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]; hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders - diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal Disorders - myalgia (with or without increases in creatine kinase), rhabdomyolysis including acute renal failure and hemodialysis, arthralgia, and myopathy. Ophthalmologic Disorders - retinal depigmentation and optic neuritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Use with Stavudine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When didanosine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when didanosine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with VIDEX in combination with stavudine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. The combination of VIDEX and hydroxyurea, with or without stavudine, should be avoided.",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Pancreatitis: Suspension or discontinuation of didanosine may be necessary. (5.1) -Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Suspend didanosine in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.2) -Hepatic toxicity: Interruption or discontinuation of didanosine must be considered upon worsening of liver disease. (5.3) -Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension: Discontinue didanosine in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. (5.4) -Patients may develop peripheral neuropathy (5.5), retinal changes and optic neuritis (5.6), immune reconstitution syndrome (5.7), and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.8). 5.1 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis has occurred during therapy with VIDEX used alone or in combination regimens in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. VIDEX should be suspended in patients with signs or symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinued in patients with confirmed pancreatitis. Patients treated with VIDEX in combination with stavudine may be at increased risk for pancreatitis. When treatment with life-sustaining drugs known to cause pancreatic toxicity is required, suspension of VIDEX (didanosine) therapy is recommended. In patients with risk factors for pancreatitis, VIDEX should be used with extreme caution and only if clearly indicated. Patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, especially the elderly, are at increased risk of pancreatitis and should be followed closely. Patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for pancreatitis if treated without dose adjustment. The frequency of pancreatitis is dose related. [See Adverse Reactions (6) .] 5.2 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including didanosine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of didanosine and stavudine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering VIDEX to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with VIDEX should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical signs or symptoms with or without laboratory findings consistent with symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of VIDEX have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided. [See Adverse Reactions (6) .] 5.4 Non-cirrhotic Portal Hypertension Postmarketing cases of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension have been reported, including cases leading to liver transplantation or death. Cases of didanosine-associated non-cirrhotic portal hypertension were confirmed by liver biopsy in patients with no evidence of viral hepatitis. Onset of signs and symptoms ranged from months to years after start of didanosine therapy. Common presenting features included elevated liver enzymes, esophageal varices, hematemesis, ascites, and splenomegaly. Patients receiving VIDEX should be monitored for early signs of portal hypertension (eg, thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly) during routine medical visits. Appropriate laboratory testing including liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, albumin, complete blood count, and international normalized ratio (INR) and ultrasonography should be considered. VIDEX should be discontinued in patients with evidence of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. 5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving VIDEX therapy. Peripheral neuropathy has occurred more frequently in patients with advanced HIV disease, in patients with a history of neuropathy, or in patients being treated with neurotoxic drug therapy, including stavudine. Discontinuation of VIDEX should be considered in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy. [See Adverse Reactions (6) .] 5.6 Retinal Changes and Optic Neuritis Retinal changes and optic neuritis have been reported in adult and pediatric patients. Periodic retinal examinations should be considered for patients receiving VIDEX [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including VIDEX. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.",
