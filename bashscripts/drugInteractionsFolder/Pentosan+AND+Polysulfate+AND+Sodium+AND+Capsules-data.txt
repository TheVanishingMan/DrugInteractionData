        "Drug-Drug Interactions In a study in which healthy subjects received pentosan polysulfate sodium 100 mg capsule or placebo every 8 hours for 7 days, and were titrated with warfarin to an INR of 1.4 to 1.8, the pharmacokinetic parameters of R-warfarin and S-warfarin were similar in the absence and presence of pentosan polysulfate sodium. INR for warfarin + placebo and warfarin + pentosan polysulfate sodium were comparable. See also PRECAUTIONS on the use of ELMIRON(R) in patients receiving other therapies with anticoagulant effects."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS ELMIRON(R) was evaluated in clinical trials in a total of 2627 patients (2343 women, 262 men, 22 unknown) with a mean age of 47 [range 18 to 88 with 581 (22%) over 60 years of age]. Of the 2627 patients, 128 patients were in a 3-month trial and the remaining 2499 patients were in a long-term, unblinded trial. Deaths occurred in 6/2627 (0.2%) patients who received the drug over a period of 3 to 75 months. The deaths appear to be related to other concurrent illnesses or procedures, except in one patient for whom the cause was not known. Serious adverse events occurred in 33/2627 (1.3%) patients. Two patients had severe abdominal pain or diarrhea and dehydration that required hospitalization. Because there was not a control group of patients with interstitial cystitis who were concurrently evaluated, it is difficult to determine which events are associated with ELMIRON(R) and which events are associated with concurrent illness, medicine, or other factors.

Of the original 2499 patients, 1192 (48%) received ELMIRON(R) for 3 months; 892 (36%) received ELMIRON for 6 months; and 598 (24%) received ELMIRON(R) for one year, 355 (14%) received ELMIRON(R) for 2 years, and 145 (6%) for 4 years. Frequency (1 to 4%): Alopecia (4%), diarrhea (4%), nausea (4%), headache (3%), rash (3%), dyspepsia (2%), abdominal pain (2%), liver function abnormalities (1%), dizziness (1%). Frequency (<= 1%): Digestive: Vomiting, mouth ulcer, colitis, esophagitis, gastritis, flatulence, constipation, anorexia, gum hemorrhage. Hematologic: Anemia, ecchymosis, increased prothrombin time, increased partial thromboplastin time, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitive Reactions: Allergic reaction, photosensitivity. Respiratory System: Pharyngitis, rhinitis, epistaxis, dyspnea. Skin and Appendages: Pruritus, urticaria. Special Senses: Conjunctivitis, tinnitus, optic neuritis, amblyopia, retinal hemorrhage. Post-Marketing Experience Rectal Hemorrhage ELMIRON(R) was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, Phase 4 study conducted in 380 patients with interstitial cystitis dosed for 32 weeks. At a daily dose of 300 mg (n = 128), rectal hemorrhage was reported as an adverse event in 6.3% of patients. The severity of the events was described as \"mild\" in most patients. Patients in that study who were administered ELMIRON(R) 900 mg daily, a dose higher than the approved dose, experienced a higher incidence of rectal hemorrhage, 15%. Liver Function Abnormality A randomized, double-blind, parallel group, phase 2 study was conducted in 100 men (51 ELMIRON(R) and 49 placebo) dosed for 16 weeks. At a daily dose of 900 mg, a dose higher than the approved dose, elevated liver function tests were reported as an adverse event in 11.8% (n = 6) of ELMIRON(R)-treated patients and 2% (n = 1) of placebo-treated patients."
