        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent adverse reactions observed with the use of dinoprostone for abortion are related to its contractile effect on smooth muscle. In the patients studied, approximately two-thirds experienced vomiting, one-half temperature elevations, two-fifths diarrhea, one-third some nausea, one-tenth headache, and one-tenth shivering and chills. In addition, approximately one-tenth of the patients studied exhibited transient diastolic blood pressure decreases of greater than 20 mmHg. Two cases of myocardial infarction following the use of dinoprostone have been reported in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.
