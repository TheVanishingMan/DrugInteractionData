(5.3) Use in children: ULESFIA ® Lotion should only be used on children under the direct supervision of an adult. Keep out of reach of children. (5.4) 5. 1 Neonatal Toxicity Intravenous administration of products containing benzyl alcohol has been associated with neonatal gasping syndrome consisting of severe metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, progressive hypotension, seizures, central nervous system depression, intraventricular hemorrhage, and death in preterm, low birth weight infants. Neonates (i.e. patients less than 1 month of age or preterm infants with a corrected age of less than 44 weeks) could be at risk for gasping syndrome if treated with ULESFIA ® Lotion [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 5.2 Eye Irritation Avoid eye exposure. ULESFIA ® Lotion may cause eye irritation. If ULESFIA ® Lotion comes in contact with the eyes, flush them immediately with water.
