        "Drug Interactions In clinical trials, no significant adverse reactions occurred with other drugs commonly used in the perioperative period, including: central nervous system depressants, autonomic drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, anti-infective agents, hormones and synthetic substitutes, blood derivatives, and cardiovascular drugs. INTRAVENOUS ANESTHETICS: Sevoflurane, USP administration is compatible with barbiturates, propofol, and other commonly used intravenous anesthetics. BENZODIAZEPINES AND OPIOIDS: Benzodiazepines and opioids would be expected to decrease the MAC of sevoflurane, USP in the same manner as with other inhalational anesthetics. Sevoflurane, USP administration is compatible with benzodiazepines and opioids as commonly used in surgical practice. Opioids, such as fentanyl, alfentanil, and sufentanil, when combined with sevoflurane, may lead to a synergistic decrease in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. NITROUS OXIDE: As with other halogenated volatile anesthetics, the anesthetic requirement for sevoflurane, USP is decreased when administered in combination with nitrous oxide. Using 50% N2O, the MAC equivalent dose requirement is reduced approximately 50% in adults, and approximately 25% in pediatric patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENTS: As is the case with other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane, USP increases both the intensity and duration of neuromuscular blockade induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. When used to supplement alfentanil-N2O anesthesia, sevoflurane, USP and isoflurane equally potentiate neuromuscular block induced with pancuronium, vecuronium or atracurium. Therefore, during sevoflurane, USP anesthesia, the dosage adjustments for these muscle relaxants are similar to those required with isoflurane. Potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents requires equilibration of muscle with delivered partial pressure of sevoflurane, USP. Reduced doses of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation. Among available nondepolarizing agents, only vecuronium, pancuronium and atracurium interactions have been studied during sevoflurane, USP anesthesia. In the absence of specific guidelines: For endotracheal intubation, do not reduce the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. During maintenance of anesthesia, the required dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is likely to be reduced compared to that during N2O/opioid anesthesia. Administration of supplemental doses of muscle relaxants should be guided by the response to nerve stimulation. The effect of sevoflurane, USP on the duration of depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by succinylcholine has not been studied. EPINEPHRINE/ ADRENALINE Sevoflurane is similar to isoflurane in the sensitization of the myocardium to the arrhythmogenic effect of exogenously administered adrenaline. The threshold dose of adrenaline producing multiple ventricular arrhythmias has been established at 5 mcg/kg body weight when administered submucosally. BETA BLOCKERS Sevoflurane may increase the negative inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects of beta blockers through blockade of cardiovascular compensation mechanisms. VERAPAMIL Impairment of atrioventricular conduction was observed when verapamil and sevoflurane were administered at the same time. ST. JOHN'S WART Severe hypotension and delayed emergence from anesthesia with halogenated inhalational anesthetics have been reported in patients treated long-term with St Johnâ€™s Wort."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse events are derived from controlled clinical trials conducted in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The reference drugs were isoflurane, enflurane, and propofol in adults and halothane in pediatric patients. The studies were conducted using a variety of premedications, other anesthetics, and surgical procedures of varying length. Most adverse events reported were mild and transient, and may reflect the surgical procedures, patient characteristics (including disease) and/or medications administered. Of the 5182 patients enrolled in the clinical trials, 2906 were exposed to sevoflurane, USP, including 118 adults and 507 pediatric patients who underwent mask induction. Each patient was counted once for each type of adverse event. Adverse events reported in patients in clinical trials and considered to be possibly or probably related to sevoflurane, USP are presented within each body system in order of decreasing frequency in the following listings. One case of malignant hyperthermia was reported in pre-registration clinical trials. Adverse Events During the Induction Period (from onset of anesthesia by mask induction to surgical incision) Incidence >1% Adult Patients (N = 118) Cardiovascular: Bradycardia 5%, Hypotension 4%, Tachycardia 2% Nervous System: Agitation 7% Respiratory System: Laryngospasm 8%, Airway obstruction 8%, Breathholding 5%, Cough Increased 5% Pediatric Patients (N = 507) Cardiovascular: Tachycardia 6%, Hypotension 4% Nervous System: Agitation 15% Respiratory System: Breathholding 5%, Cough Increased 5%, Laryngospasm 3%, Apnea 2% Digestive System: Increased salivation 2% Adverse Events During Maintenance and Emergence Periods, Incidence >1% (N = 2906) Body as a whole: Fever 1%, Shivering 6%, Hypothermia 1%, Movement 1%, Headache 1% Cardiovascular: Hypotension 11%, Hypertension 2%, Bradycardia 5%, Tachycardia 2% Nervous System: Somnolence 9%, Agitation 9%, Dizziness 4%, Increased salivation 4% Digestive System: Nausea 25%, Vomiting 18% Respiratory System: Cough increased 11%, Breathholding 2%, Laryngospasm 2% Adverse Events, All Patients in Clinical Trials (N = 2906), All Anesthetic Periods, Incidence <1% (reported in 3 or more patients) Body as a whole: Asthenia, Pain Cardiovascular: Arrhythmia, Ventricular Extrasystoles, Supraventricular Extrasystoles, Complete AV Block, Bigeminy, Hemorrhage, Inverted T Wave, Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial Arrhythmia, Second Degree AV Block, Syncope, S-T Depressed Nervous System: Crying, Nervousness, Confusion, Hypertonia, Dry Mouth, Insomnia Respiratory System: Sputum Increased, Apnea, Hypoxia, Wheezing, Bronchospasm, Hyperventilation, Pharyngitis, Hiccup, Hypoventilation, Dyspnea, Stridor Metabolism and Nutrition: Increases in LDH, AST, ALT, BUN, Alkaline Phosphatase, Creatinine, Bilirubinemia, Glycosuria, Fluorosis, Albuminuria, Hypophosphatemia, Acidosis, Hyperglycemia Hemic and Lymphatic System: Leucocytosis, Thrombocytopenia Skin and Special Senses: Amblyopia, Pruritus, Taste Perversion, Rash, Conjunctivitis Urogenital: Urination Impaired, Urine Abnormality, Urinary Retention, Oliguria See WARNINGS for information regarding malignant hyperthermia. Adverse Events During Post-Marketing Experience: Post-marketing reports indicate that sevoflurane, USP use has been associated with seizures and dystonic movements. The majority of cases of seizures were in children and young adults, most of whom had no medical history of seizures. Several cases reported no concomitant medications, and at least one case was confirmed by EEG. Although many cases were single seizures that resolved spontaneously or after treatment, cases of multiple seizures have also been reported. Seizures have occurred during, or soon after sevoflurane, USP induction, during emergence, and during post-operative recovery up to a day following anesthesia. Rare cases of malignant hyperthermia (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS) and allergic reactions, such as rash, urticaria, pruritis, bronchospasm, eyelid edema, anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS) have been reported. CARDIAC DISORDERS: Cardiac arrest, Ventricular fibrillation, Torsade de pointes, Ventricular tachycardia, Electrocardiogram QT prolonged GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS: Pancreatitis Very rare cases of mild, moderate and severe post-operative hepatic dysfunction or hepatitis with or without jaundice have been reported. Histological evidence was not provided for any of the reported hepatitis cases. In most of these cases, patients had underlying hepatic conditions or were under treatment with drugs known to cause hepatic dysfunction. Most of the reported events were transient and resolved spontaneously (see PRECAUTIONS). In addition, there have been rare post-marketing reports of hepatic failure and hepatic necrosis associated with the use of potent volatile anesthetic agents, including sevoflurane, USP. However, the actual incidence and relationship of sevoflurane, USP to these events cannot be established with certainty. MUSCULOSKELETAL, CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND BONE DISORDERS: Muscle rigidity, Rhabdomyolosis. RENAL AND URINARY DISORDERS: Renal failure, Tubulointerstitial nephritis GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS: Edema Laboratory Findings Transient elevations in glucose, liver function tests, and white blood cell count may occur as with use of other anesthetic agents."

Administration of supplemental doses of muscle relaxants should be guided by the response to nerve stimulation. The effect of sevoflurane on the duration of depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by succinylcholine has not been studied. Hepatic Function Results of evaluations of laboratory parameters (e.g., ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, etc.) as well as investigator-reported incidence of adverse events relating to liver function, demonstrate that sevoflurane can be administered to patients with normal or mild-to-moderately impaired hepatic function. However, patients with severe hepatic dysfunction were not investigated. Occasional cases of transient changes in postoperative hepatic function tests were reported with both sevoflurane and reference agents. Sevoflurane was found to be comparable to isoflurane with regard to these changes in hepatic function. Very rare cases of mild, moderate and severe post-operative hepatic dysfunction or hepatitis with or without jaundice have been reported from post-marketing experiences. Clinical judgment should be exercised when sevoflurane is used in patients with underlying hepatic conditions or under treatment with drugs known to cause hepatic dysfunction (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). It has been reported that previous exposure to halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics, especially if the interval is less than 3 months, may increase the potential for hepatic injury. Desiccated CO2 Absorbents An exothermic reaction occurs when sevoflurane is exposed to CO2 absorbents. This reaction is increased when the CO2 absorbent becomes desiccated, such as after an extended period of dry gas flow through the CO2 absorbent canisters. Rare cases of extreme heat, smoke and/or spontaneous fire in the anesthesia breathing circuit have been reported during sevoflurane use in conjunction with the use of desiccated CO2 absorbent, specifically those containing potassium hydroxide (e.g. BaralymeÂ®). KOH containing CO2 absorbents are not recommended for use with sevoflurane. An unusually delayed rise or unexpected decline of inspired sevoflurane concentration compared to the vaporizer setting may be associated with excessive heating of the CO2 absorbent and chemical breakdown of sevoflurane. As with other inhalational anesthetics, degradation and production of degradation products can occur when sevoflurane is exposed to desiccated absorbents. When a clinician suspects that the CO2 absorbent may be desiccated, it should be replaced. The color indicator of most CO2 absorbents may not change upon desiccation. Therefore, the lack of significant color change should not be taken as an assurance of adequate hydration. CO2 absorbents should be replaced routinely regardless of the state of the color indicator."

The majority of cases were in children and young adults, most of whom had no medical history of seizures. Several cases reported no concomitant medications, and at least one case was confirmed by EEG. Although many cases were single seizures that resolved spontaneously or after treatment, cases of multiple seizures have also been reported. Seizures have occurred during, or soon after sevoflurane induction, during emergence, and during post-operative recovery up to a day following anesthesia. Cardiac Cardiac arrest Hepatic Cases of mild, moderate and severe post-operative hepatic dysfunction or hepatitis with or without jaundice have been reported. Histological evidence was not provided for any of the reported hepatitis cases. In most of these cases, patients had underlying hepatic conditions or were under treatment with drugs known to cause hepatic dysfunction. Most of the reported events were transient and resolved spontaneously (see PRECAUTIONS ).

        "Drug Interactions In clinical trials, no significant adverse reactions occurred with other drugs commonly used in the perioperative period, including: central nervous system depressants, autonomic drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, anti-infective agents, hormones and synthetic substitutes, blood derivatives, and cardiovascular drugs. Intravenous Anesthetics Sevoflurane administration is compatible with barbiturates, propofol, and other commonly used intravenous anesthetics. Benzodiazepines and Opioids Benzodiazepines and opioids would be expected to decrease the MAC of sevoflurane in the same manner as with other inhalational anesthetics. Sevoflurane administration is compatible with benzodiazepines and opioids as commonly used in surgical practice. Nitrous Oxide As with other halogenated volatile anesthetics, the anesthetic requirement for sevoflurane is decreased when administered in combination with nitrous oxide. Using 50% N2O, the MAC equivalent dose requirement is reduced approximately 50% in adults, and approximately 25% in pediatric patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Neuromuscular Blocking Agents As is the case with other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane increases both the intensity and duration of neuromuscular blockade induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. When used to supplement alfentanil-N2O anesthesia, sevoflurane and isoflurane equally potentiate neuromuscular block induced with pancuronium, vecuronium or atracurium. Therefore, during sevoflurane anesthesia, the dosage adjustments for these muscle relaxants are similar to those required with isoflurane. Potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents requires equilibration of muscle with delivered partial pressure of sevoflurane. Reduced doses of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation. Among available nondepolarizing agents, only vecuronium, pancuronium and atracurium interactions have been studied during sevoflurane anesthesia. In the absence of specific guidelines: For endotracheal intubation, do not reduce the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. During maintenance of anesthesia, the required dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is likely to be reduced compared to that during N2O/opioid anesthesia. Administration of supplemental doses of muscle relaxants should be guided by the response to nerve stimulation. The effect of sevoflurane on the duration of depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by succinylcholine has not been studied."

Administration of supplemental doses of muscle relaxants should be guided by the response to nerve stimulation. The effect of sevoflurane on the duration of depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by succinylcholine has not been studied. Hepatic Function Results of evaluations of laboratory parameters (e.g., ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, etc.) as well as investigator-reported incidence of adverse events relating to liver function, demonstrate that sevoflurane can be administered to patients with normal or mild-to-moderately impaired hepatic function. However, patients with severe hepatic dysfunction were not investigated. Occasional cases of transient changes in postoperative hepatic function tests were reported with both sevoflurane and reference agents. Sevoflurane was found to be comparable to isoflurane with regard to these changes in hepatic function. Very rare cases of mild, moderate and severe post-operative hepatic dysfunction or hepatitis with or without jaundice have been reported from post-marketing experiences. Clinical judgment should be exercised when sevoflurane is used in patients with underlying hepatic conditions or under treatment with drugs known to cause hepatic dysfunction (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). It has been reported that previous exposure to halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics, especially if the interval is less than 3 months, may increase the potential for hepatic injury. Desiccated CO2 Absorbents An exothermic reaction occurs when sevoflurane is exposed to CO2 absorbents. This reaction is increased when the CO2 absorbent becomes desiccated, such as after an extended period of dry gas flow through the CO2 absorbent canisters. Rare cases of extreme heat, smoke and/or spontaneous fire in the anesthesia breathing circuit have been reported during sevoflurane use in conjunction with the use of desiccated CO2 absorbent, specifically those containing potassium hydroxide (e.g. BaralymeÂ®). KOH containing CO2 absorbents are not recommended for use with sevoflurane. An unusually delayed rise or unexpected decline of inspired sevoflurane concentration compared to the vaporizer setting may be associated with excessive heating of the CO2 absorbent and chemical breakdown of sevoflurane. As with other inhalational anesthetics, degradation and production of degradation products can occur when sevoflurane is exposed to desiccated absorbents. When a clinician suspects that the CO2 absorbent may be desiccated, it should be replaced. The color indicator of most CO2 absorbents may not change upon desiccation. Therefore, the lack of significant color change should not be taken as an assurance of adequate hydration. CO2 absorbents should be replaced routinely regardless of the state of the color indicator."
