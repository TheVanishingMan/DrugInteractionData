        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bleeding events: Hemorrhage can occur at any site. Discontinue Bivalirudin for an unexplained fall in blood pressure or hematocrit. (5.1) Coronary artery brachytherapy: Risk of thrombus formation, including fatal outcomes, in gamma brachytherapy. (5.2) 5.1 Bleeding Events Although most bleeding associated with the use of Bivalirudin in PCI/PTCA occurs at the site of arterial puncture, hemorrhage can occur at any site. An unexplained fall in blood pressure or hematocrit should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event and cessation of Bivalirudin administration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Bivalirudin should be used with caution in patients with disease states associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 5.2 Coronary Artery Brachytherapy An increased risk of thrombus formation, including fatal outcomes, has been associated with the use of Bivalirudin in gamma brachytherapy. If a decision is made to use Bivalirudin during brachytherapy procedures, maintain meticulous catheter technique, with frequent aspiration and flushing, paying special attention to minimizing conditions of stasis within the catheter or vessels [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]."

Bivalirudin should be used with caution in patients with disease states associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 5.2 Coronary Artery Brachytherapy An increased risk of thrombus formation, including fatal outcomes, has been associated with the use of bivalirudin in gamma brachytherapy. If a decision is made to use bivalirudin during brachytherapy procedures, maintain meticulous catheter technique, with frequent aspiration and flushing, paying special attention to minimizing conditions of stasis within the catheter or vessels [ see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] .",

In the BAT trial, there was no causality assessment for adverse events. 6.2 Immunogenicity/Re-Exposure In in vitro studies, Angiomax exhibited no platelet aggregation response against sera from patients with a history of HIT/HITTS. Among 494 subjects who received Angiomax in clinical trials and were tested for antibodies, 2 subjects had treatment-emergent positive bivalirudin antibody tests. Neither subject demonstrated clinical evidence of allergic or anaphylactic reactions and repeat testing was not performed. Nine additional patients who had initial positive tests were negative on repeat testing. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because postmarketing adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Angiomax: fatal bleeding; hypersensitivity and allergic reactions including reports of anaphylaxis; lack of anticoagulant effect; thrombus formation during PCI with and without intracoronary brachytherapy, including reports of fatal outcomes; pulmonary hemorrhage; cardiac tamponade; and INR increased."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bleeding events: Hemorrhage can occur at any site. Discontinue Angiomax for an unexplained fall in blood pressure or hematocrit. (5.1) Acute Stent Thrombosis: Increased incidence of acute stent thrombosis in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI. (2.1, 5.2) Coronary artery brachytherapy: Risk of thrombus formation, including fatal outcomes, in gamma brachytherapy. (5.3) Laboratory Test Interference: Bivalirudin interferes with INR measurements. (5.4) 5.1 Bleeding Events Although most bleeding associated with the use of Angiomax in PCI/PTCA occurs at the site of arterial puncture, hemorrhage can occur at any site. An unexplained fall in blood pressure or hematocrit should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event and cessation of Angiomax administration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Angiomax should be used with caution in patients with disease states associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 5.2 Acute Stent Thrombosis in Patients with STEMI undergoing PCI Acute stent thrombosis (AST) (<4 hours) has been observed at a greater frequency in Angiomax treated patients (1.2%, 36/2889) compared to heparin treated patients (0.2%, 6/2911) with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. Among patients who experienced an AST, one fatality (0.03%) occurred in an Angiomax treated patient and one fatality (0.03%) in a heparin treated patient. These patients have been managed by Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR). Patients should remain for at least 24 hours in a facility capable of managing ischemic complications and should be carefully monitored following primary PCI for signs and symptoms consistent with myocardial ischemia. 5.3 Coronary Artery Brachytherapy An increased risk of thrombus formation, including fatal outcomes, has been associated with the use of Angiomax in gamma brachytherapy. If a decision is made to use Angiomax during brachytherapy procedures, maintain meticulous catheter technique, with frequent aspiration and flushing, paying special attention to minimizing conditions of stasis within the catheter or vessels [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.4 Laboratory Test Interference Angiomax affects International Normalized Ratio (INR), therefore INR measurements made in patients who have been treated with Angiomax may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin."

In the BAT trial, there was no causality assessment for adverse events. 6.2 Immunogenicity/Re-Exposure In in vitro studies, Bivalirudin exhibited no platelet aggregation response against sera from patients with a history of HIT/HITTS. Among 494 subjects who received Bivalirudin in clinical trials and were tested for antibodies, 2 subjects had treatment-emergent positive bivalirudin antibody tests. Neither subject demonstrated clinical evidence of allergic or anaphylactic reactions and repeat testing was not performed. Nine additional patients who had initial positive tests were negative on repeat testing. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because postmarketing adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Bivalirudin: fatal bleeding; hypersensitivity and allergic reactions including reports of anaphylaxis; lack of anticoagulant effect; thrombus formation during PCI with and without intracoronary brachytherapy, including reports of fatal outcomes."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bleeding events: Hemorrhage can occur at any site. Discontinue Bivalirudin for an unexplained fall in blood pressure or hematocrit. (5.1) Coronary artery brachytherapy: Risk of thrombus formation, including fatal outcomes, in gamma brachytherapy. (5.2) 5.1 Bleeding Events Although most bleeding associated with the use of Bivalirudin in PCI/PTCA occurs at the site of arterial puncture, hemorrhage can occur at any site. An unexplained fall in blood pressure or hematocrit should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event and cessation of Bivalirudin administration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Bivalirudin should be used with caution in patients with disease states associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 5.2 Coronary Artery Brachytherapy An increased risk of thrombus formation, including fatal outcomes, has been associated with the use of Bivalirudin in gamma brachytherapy. If a decision is made to use Bivalirudin during brachytherapy procedures, maintain meticulous catheter technique, with frequent aspiration and flushing, paying special attention to minimizing conditions of stasis within the catheter or vessels [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]."
