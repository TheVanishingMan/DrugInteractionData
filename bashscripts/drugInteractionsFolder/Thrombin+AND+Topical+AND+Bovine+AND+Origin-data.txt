        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions during clinical trial (reported in at least 2% of subjects treated with EVITHROM) were prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, increased INR, decreased lymphocyte count, prolonged prothrombin time and increased neutrophil count. The most common adverse reactions during clinical trial (reported in at least 2% of subjects treated with EVITHROM) were prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, increased INR, decreased lymphocyte count, prolonged prothrombin time and increased neutrophil count. Adverse events were reported in the clinical trial with similar frequency in the two study groups (EVITHROM or bovine thrombin group) (6). Anaphylactic reactions may occur ( 6 ). Immunogenicity was evaluated by testing for the development of antibodies to highly purified antigens: human thrombin, human Factor V/Va, bovine thrombin and bovine Factor V/Va. None of the patients treated with EVITHROM developed antibodies to human thrombin or to human Factor V/Va. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ETHICON Customer Support Center at (877) 384-4266 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Anaphylactic reactions may occur in rare cases. No adverse events of this type were reported during the conduct of the clinical trials. Mild reactions can be managed with anti-histamines. Severe hypotensive reactions require immediate intervention using current principles of shock therapy. In a phase III multicenter, prospective, controlled, randomized, double-blinded study of 305 subjects where EVITHROM (n=153) was compared with bovine thrombin (n=152), occurrence of adverse events was not statistically different between the two groups. Overall, adverse events occurred in similar proportions of subjects in the two study groups (see Table 1). No clinically significant differences were seen in age (<65 years, >65 years) or gender subgroup analyses of adverse events. At least one serious adverse event (SAE) was reported for 26/153 (17%) subjects treated with human thrombin and 17/152 (11%) subjects treated with bovine thrombin. The SAEs reported were associated with post-surgical complications (e.g. wound infection 3/153 for EVITHROM and 2/152 for bovine thrombin) and the medical condition of the subject and were not considered related to study drug. Two subjects (1.3%) in EVITHROM group experienced a treatment emergent severe adverse event: respiratory arrest and post-procedural hematoma (in one subject) and extradural hematoma. Three subjects in the bovine thrombin group experienced a treatment emergent severe adverse event: hyperhidrosis, pyrexia and post-procedural hematoma. No deaths were reported during the study period. Viral serology was not monitored during the study with EVITHROM. However, no adverse events indicative of infection with transfusion-transmissible agents were reported. Table 1: Incidence of subjects with related adverse events reported in at least 2% of subjects treated with either human or bovine thrombin Thrombin Type System Organ Class/Adverse Event EVITHROM (n=153) Bovine (n=152) Total (n=305) Investigations 11 (7.2%) 14 (9.2%) 25 (8.2%) Activated partial thromboplastin time increased 4 (2.6%) 8 (5.3%) 12 (3.9%) International normalized ratio increased 4 (2.6%) 5 (3.3%) 9 (3.0%) Lymphocyte count decreased 4 (2.6%) 2 (1.3%) 6 (2.0%) Prothrombin time prolonged 4 (2.6%) 8 (5.3%) 12 (3.9%) Neutrophil count increased 3 (2.0%) 2 (1.3%) 5 (1.6%) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders 1 (0.7%) 3 (2.0%) 4 (1.3%) Pruritis 1 (0.7%) 3 (2.0%) 4 (1.3%) General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions 0 3 (2.0%) 3 (1.0%) Immunogenicity In the clinical study, serum samples were collected at baseline and at 5 weeks post-surgery for evaluation of antibodies to bovine thrombin, bovine Factor V/Va, human thrombin, and human Factor V/Va. Samples were collected at both time points for 81.3% of the subjects. The ELISA data were adjudicated by a panel of experts blinded to treatment assignment. After reviewing all data, the panel used an algorithm for assigning outcomes for each antigen: seroconversion negative or seroconversion positive. The protocol did not specify any comparative analysis for immunogenicity data, only descriptive statistics. The adjudicated results show that 3.3% of the subjects treated with EVITHROM (frozen formulation) developed antibodies to any of the four antigens, compared to 12.7% of the subjects developing antibodies in the control group (bovine thrombin). 7.94% of the subjects treated with bovine thrombin (control group) developed antibodies to bovine thrombin and 9.52% of these subjects developed antibodies to bovine Factor V/Va. A few control subjects had antibodies that cross-reacted with human thrombin, but none had antibodies that cross-reacted with human Factor V/Va. None of the patients treated with EVITHROM developed detectable antibodies to human thrombin or to human Factor V/Va. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent upon the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The observed incidence of a positive signal in an assay may be influenced by several factors including timing of sampling, sample handling, concomitant medications, or underlying disease. Therefore, direct comparison of incidence of antibody development to human thrombin, bovine thrombin, human Factor V/Va or bovine Factor V/Va following administration of EVITHROM with incidence of antibody development following administration of other products may be misleading and the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience No adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous post-marketing reports."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 1% of patients treated with ARTISS were skin graft failure and pruritus (6.1, 6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare Corporation at 1-866-888-2472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Overall Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 1% of patients treated with ARTISS were skin graft failure and pruritus. Hypersensitivity/Allergic/Anaphylactic Reactions: Hypersensitivity or allergic/anaphylactoid reactions may occur (see WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS, Hypersensitivity/Allergic/Anaphylactic Reactions (5.1) ). No adverse events of this type were reported during clinical trials. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The following adverse reactions have been reported from a clinical trial where ARTISS was used to affix split thickness sheet skin grafts to excised burn wounds (see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)). A total of 8 non-serious adverse reactions were deemed related to the use of ARTISS by the investigator. Of the 8 related non-serious adverse reactions, 5 were incidences of skin graft failure: 4 were graft detachment/non-adherence and 1 was graft necrosis. The graft detachment in 2 patients may have been related to the maximum thawing temperature (40°C) being exceeded during study product preparation. The 3 other non-serious adverse reactions considered related to ARTISS were 2 incidences of pruritus and 1 incidence of dermal cyst. The graft necrosis and the 2 cases of pruritus considered related to ARTISS each had an equivalent adverse reaction with the exact start date and severity reported at a control wound where skin grafts were affixed with staples. Therefore, these events are most likely not related to ARTISS, but instead are expected outcomes for any grafted wound regardless of the method of attachment. Overall, the data collected and analyzed during this study demonstrated that ARTISS is safe for the attachment of sheet skin grafts in subjects with deep partial thickness or full thickness burn wounds. The adverse reactions and their frequencies are summarized in Table 2: Table 2. Adverse reactions (Preferred Term) Number of events/ Number of patients treated Dermal cyst 1/138 Pruritus 2/138 Skin graft failure 5/138 6.3 Post Marketing The following adverse reactions reflect what has been reported in post marketing experience with Baxter's fibrin sealant that could reasonably be expected to occur with ARTISS: Immune system disorders: anaphylactic responses, hypersensitivity Cardiac disorders: bradycardia, tachycardia Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Gastrointestinal disorders: nausea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria General disorders and administration site conditions: flushing, impaired healing, edema, pyrexia Injury, poisoning and procedural complication: seroma Air embolism associated with misapplication of fibrin sealant using the spray device, Class Effect: A postmarketing fatality was reported in association with the use of another fibrin sealant when applied using a spray device. The case involved an attempt to stop active bleeding by applying the fibrin sealant using a spray device attached to a wall unit at a higher than recommended pressure for the spray device. In addition, the spray head was placed at a distance from the bleeding site that was closer than the recommended distance guidelines for the application of the sealant. The patient suffered a fatal air embolism. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Apply only as thin layer (2.3, 5.2) Air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure regulator to administer fibrin sealants. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than recommended pressures and in close proximity to the surface of the tissue (5.2) Exposure to solutions containing alcohol, iodine or heavy metals may cause ARTISS to be denatured (5.2) This product is made from pooled human plasma which may, theoretically, contain infectious agents (5.3) 5.1 Hypersensitivity/Allergic/Anaphylactic Reactions Hypersensitivity or allergic/anaphylactoid reactions may occur with the use of ARTISS. Cases (<1/10,000) have been reported in post marketing experience with Baxter's fibrin sealant (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Post Marketing (6.3)). In specific cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis. Such reactions may especially be seen if ARTISS is applied repeatedly over time or in the same setting, or if systemic aprotinin has been administered previously. Even if the first treatment was well tolerated, a subsequent administration of ARTISS or systemic aprotinin may not exclude the occurrence of an allergic reaction. Symptoms associated with allergic anaphylactic reactions include: flush, urticaria, pruritus, nausea, drop in blood pressure, tachycardia or bradycardia, dyspnea, severe hypotension and anaphylactic shock. Such reactions may also occur in patients receiving ARTISS for the first time. Discontinue administration of ARTISS in the event of hypersensitivity reactions. Remove the already applied, polymerized product from the surgical field. Mild reactions can be managed with antihistamines. Severe hypotensive reactions require immediate intervention using current principles of shock therapy. 5.2 Application Precautions Apply ARTISS as a thin layer. Excessive clot thickness may negatively interfere with the product’s efficacy and the wound healing process. Air or gas embolism has occurred with the use of spray devices employing pressure regulator to administer fibrin sealants. This event appears to be related to the use of the spray device at higher than recommended pressures and in close proximity to the tissue surface. When applying ARTISS using a spray device, be sure to use the pressure within the pressure range recommended by the spray device manufacturer. In the absence of a specific recommendation avoid using pressure above 20-25 psi. Do not spray closer than the distance recommended by the spray device manufacturer. In the absence of a specific recommendation avoid spraying closer than 10-15 cm from the surface of the tissue. When spraying ARTISS, changes in blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation and end tidal CO2 should be monitored because of the possibility of occurrence of air or gas embolism. The sealer protein and thrombin solutions can be denatured by alcohol, iodine or heavy metal ions (e.g. antiseptic solutions). If any of these substances have been used to clean the wound area, the area must be thoroughly rinsed before application of ARTISS and made as dry as possible. 5.3 Infection Risk from Human Plasma ARTISS is made from human plasma. Products made from human plasma may contain infectious agents, such as viruses, that can cause disease. The risk that such products will transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and by inactivating and removing certain viruses (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Other Clinical Pharmacology Information (12.4)). Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. Because this product is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses or other pathogens. All infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Baxter Healthcare Corporation, telephone # 1-866-888-2472. Some viruses, such as parvovirus B19, are particularly difficult to remove or inactivate at this time. Parvovirus B19 most seriously affects pregnant women (fetal infection), immune-compromised individuals or individuals with an increased erythropoiesis (e.g., hemolytic anemia) (see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS, Pregnancy (8.1) and PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17))."

The most common adverse reactions reported in >1% of patients during clinical trials were anemia, nausea and vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, increased white blood cell count, ascites, itching, atrial fibrillation, pleural effusion, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, wound infection, hypophosphatemia, urinary tract infection and post-procedural bile leakage in hepatic surgery. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare Corporation at 1-866-888-2472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Cardiovascular Surgery In the cardiovascular trial, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were atrial fibrillation and pleural effusion. Seventy-four percent (74%) of patients treated with TachoSil and 75% of comparator treated patients experienced one or more clinically relevant adverse reactions (see Table 2). Table 2.

However in a clinical trial with human fibrinogen/human thrombin sponge (patch) in hepatic surgery, in which patients were investigated for the development of antibodies, about 26% of the 96 patients tested and treated with human fibrinogen/human thrombin sponge (patch) developed antibodies to equine collagen. The equine collagen antibodies that developed in some patients after human fibrinogen/human thrombin sponge (patch) use were not reactive with human collagen. One patient developed antibodies to human fibrinogen. There were no adverse events attributable to the development of human fibrinogen or equine collagen antibodies. There is very limited clinical data available regarding re-exposure of the human fibrinogen/human thrombin sponge (patch). Two subjects have been re-exposed in a clinical trial and have not reported any immune-mediated adverse events, however, their antibody status to collagen or fibrinogen is unknown. Pediatric Clinical Trial Experience In pediatric patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea, hypertension and increased transaminases (see Table 4). Ninety-four percent (94%) of patients treated with TachoSil and 100% of comparator treated patients experienced one or more clinically relevant adverse reactions. Table 4.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Thrombosis can occur if TachoSil is applied intravascularly. Ensure that TachoSil is applied to the surface of cardiac, vascular or hepatic tissue only. (5.1) •Can cause hypersensitivity or allergic/anaphylactoid reactions with first time or repetitive application. (5.2) •Avoid use in contaminated areas of the body or in the presence of an active infection. (5.3) •TachoSil contains collagen, which may adhere to bleeding surfaces. (5.4) •Avoid over-packing in cavities or closed spaces, because this may cause compression of underlying tissue. (5.5) •Use the least number of patches required to cover the entire bleeding area. Do not pack. Remove any unattached pieces of TachoSil. (5.6) •May carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, such as viruses, and theoretically, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent, and the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agents, despite manufacturing steps designed to reduce the risk of viral transmission. (5.7) 5.1 Thrombosis Thrombosis can occur if TachoSil is applied intravascularly. Ensure that TachoSil is applied to the surface of cardiac, vascular, or hepatic tissue only. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity or allergic/anaphylactoid reactions may occur with TachoSil. Symptoms associated with allergic anaphylactic reactions include: flush, urticaria, pruritus, nausea, drop in blood pressure, tachycardia or bradycardia, dyspnea, severe hypotension and anaphylactic shock. These reactions may occur in patients receiving TachoSil for the first time or may increase with repetitive applications of TachoSil. 5.3 Infection Avoid application to contaminated or infected areas of the body, or in the presence of active infection. 5.4 Adhesions TachoSil contains collagen, which may adhere to bleeding surfaces. 5.5 Compression When placing TachoSil into cavities or closed spaces, avoid over-packing because this may cause compression of underlying tissue. 5.6 Dislodged Material Use only minimum amount of TachoSil patches necessary to achieve hemostasis. Do not pack. Theoretically, excess patch material can become dislodged and migrate to other areas of the body. Remove unattached pieces of TachoSil; if medically necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.7 Transmissible Infectious Agents Because the biological components of this product are made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents (e.g., viruses), and theoretically, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent and the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. The risk that TachoSil will transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain virus infections, and by inactivating and removing, certain viruses [see Description (11)].
