        "Drug Interactions Codeine: In patients receiving MAO inhibitors, an initial small test dose is advisable to allow observation of any excessive narcotic effects or MAOI interaction. Promethazine CNS Depressants - Promethazine may increase, prolong or intensify the sedative action of other central-nervous-system depressants, such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine HCl. When given concomitantly with promethazine, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Dosage must be individualized. Excessive amounts of promethazine HCl relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in the patient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain. Epinephrine - Because of the potential for promethazine to reverse epinephrine's vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with promethazine overdose. Anticholinergics - Concomitant use of other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken with caution. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) - Drug interactions, including an increased incidence of extrapyramidal effects, have been reported when some MAOI and phenothiazines are used concomitantly. Phenylephrine Drug Effect Phenylephrine with prior administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). Cardiac pressor response potentiated. May cause acute hypertensive crisis. Phenylephrine with tricyclic antidepressants. Pressor response increased. Phenylephrine with ergot alkaloids. Excessive rise in blood pressure. Phenylephrine with bronchodilator sympathomimetic agents and with epinephrine or other sympathomimetics. Tachycardia or other arrhythmias may occur. Phenylephrine with prior administration of propranolol or other β-adrenergic blockers. Cardiostimulating effects blocked. Phenylephrine with atropine sulfate. Reflex bradycardia blocked; pressor response enhanced. Phenylephrine with prior administration of phentolamine or other α-adrenergic blockers. Pressor response decreased.

Promethazine CNS depressants - Promethazine may increase, prolong, or intensify the sedative action of other central-nervous-system depressants, such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine HCl. When given concomitantly with promethazine, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Dosage must be individualized. Excessive amounts of promethazine HCl relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in the patient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain. Epinephrine - Because of the potential for promethazine to reverse epinephrine's vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with promethezine overdose. Anticholinergics - Concomitant use of other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken with caution. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) - Drug interactions, including an increased incidence of extrapyramidal effects, have been reported when some MAOI and phenothiazines are used concomitantly. Phenylephrine: Drug Effect Phenylephrine with prior administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). Cardiac pressor response potentiated. May cause acute hypertensive crisis. Phenylephrine with tricyclic antidepressants. Pressor response increased. Phenylephrine with ergot alkaloids. Excessive rise in blood pressure. Phenylephrine with bronchodilator sympathomimetic agents and with epinephrine or other sympathomimetics. Tachycardia or other arrhythmias may occur. Phenylephrine with prior administration of propranolol or other β-adrenergic blockers. Cardiostimulating effects blocked. Phenylephrine with atropine sulfate. Reflex bradycardia blocked; pressor response enhanced. Phenylephrine with prior administration of phentolamine or other α-adrenergic blockers. Pressor response decreased.

The infusion site should be checked for free flow. Care should be taken to avoid extravasation of VAZCULEP. 5.4 Bradycardia VAZCULEP can cause severe bradycardia and decreased cardiac output. 5.5 Allergic Reactions VAZCULEP contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. 5.6 Renal Toxicity VAZCULEP can increase the need for renal replacement therapy in patients with septic shock. Monitor renal function. 5.7 Risk of Augmented Pressor Affect in Patients with Autonomic Dysfunction The increasing blood pressure response to adrenergic drugs, including VAZCULEP, can be increased in patients with autonomic dysfunction, as may occur with spinal cord injuries. 5.8 Pressor Effect with Concomitant Oxytocic Drugs Oxytocic drugs potentiate the increasing blood pressure effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines including VAZCULEP [see Drug Interactions (7.1)], with the potential for hemorrhagic stroke."

        "Drug Interactions: Codeine: In patients receiving MAO inhibitors, an initial small test dose is advisable to allow observation of any excessive narcotic effects or MAOI interaction. Promethazine: CNS Depressants - Promethazine may increase, prolong, or intensify the sedative action of other central-nervous-system depressants, such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine HCl. When given concomitantly with promethazine, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Dosage must be individualized. Excessive amounts of promethazine HCl relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in the patient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain. Epinephrine - Because of the potential for promethazine to reverse epinephrine's vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with promethazine overdose.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe bradycardia and decreased cardiac output: (5.2) Extravasation: during intravenous administration may cause necrosis or sloughing of tissue (5.4) Concomitant use with oxytocic drugs: pressor effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines is potentiated (5.5) Allergic-type reactions: Sulfite (5.6) 5.1 Exacerbation of Angina, Heart Failure, or Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Because of its pressor effects, phenylephrine hydrochloride can precipitate angina in patients with severe arteriosclerosis or history of angina, exacerbate underlying heart failure, and increase pulmonary arterial pressure. 5.2 Bradycardia Phenylephrine hydrochloride can cause severe bradycardia and decreased cardiac output. 5.3 Risk in Patients with Autonomic Dysfunction The pressor response to adrenergic drugs, including phenylephrine, can be increased in patients with autonomic dysfunction, as may occur with spinal cord injuries. 5.4 Skin and Subcutaneous Necrosis Extravasation of phenylephrine can cause necrosis or sloughing of tissue. 5.5 Pressor Effect with Concomitant Oxytocic Drugs Oxytocic drugs potentiate the pressor effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines including phenylephrine hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7.1 )], with the potential for hemorrhagic stroke. 5.6 Allergic Reactions This product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people. 5.7 Peripheral and Visceral Ischemia Phenylephrine hydrochloride can cause excessive peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction and ischemia to vital organs, particularly in patients with extensive peripheral vascular disease. 5.8 Renal Toxicity Phenylephrine hydrochloride can increase the need for renal replacement therapy in patients with septic shock. Monitor renal function."
