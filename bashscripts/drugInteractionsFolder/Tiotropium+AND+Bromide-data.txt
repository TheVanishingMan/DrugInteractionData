        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Other adrenergic drugs may potentiate effect. Use with caution. (5.3, 7.1) Xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, or non-potassium sparing diuretics may potentiate hypokalemia or ECG changes. Use with caution. (7.2, 7.3) MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and drugs that prolong QTc interval may potentiate effect on cardiovascular system. Use with extreme caution. (7.4) Beta-blockers may decrease effectiveness. Use with caution and only when medically necessary. (7.5) Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT with other anticholinergic-containing drugs. (7.6) 7.1 Adrenergic Drugs If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the sympathetic effects of olodaterol, one component of STIOLTO RESPIMAT may be potentiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6, 5.10, 5.11)]. 7.2 Sympathomimetics, Xanthine Derivatives, Steroids, or Diuretics Tiotropium has been used concomitantly with short-acting and long-acting sympathomimetic (beta-agonists) bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids, without increases in adverse reactions. Concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, or diuretics may potentiate any hypokalemic effect of olodaterol [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. 7.3 Non-Potassium Sparing Diuretics The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT with non-potassium sparing diuretics. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors, Tricyclic Antidepressants, QTc Prolonging Drugs STIOLTO RESPIMAT, as with other drugs containing beta2-agonists, should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants or other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval because the action of adrenergic agonists on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents. Drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval may be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. 7.5 Beta-Blockers Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and the olodaterol component of STIOLTO RESPIMAT may interfere with the effect of each other when administered concurrently. Beta-blockers not only block the therapeutic effects of beta-agonists, but may produce severe bronchospasm in COPD patients. Therefore, patients with COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. 7.6 Anticholinergics There is potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Therefore, avoid co-administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 7.7 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 and P-gp Efflux Transporter In a drug interaction study using the strong dual CYP and P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole, a 1.7-fold increase of olodaterol maximum plasma concentrations and AUC was observed [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. Olodaterol was evaluated in clinical trials for up to one year at doses up to twice the recommended therapeutic dose. No dose adjustment of STIOLTO RESPIMAT is necessary."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS LABA, such as olodaterol, one of the active components in STIOLTO RESPIMAT, increase the risk of asthma-related death. STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [see Boxed Warning and Warning and Precautions 5.1]. The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] The most common adverse reactions (>3% incidence and more than an active control) were nasopharyngitis, cough, and back pain. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidences in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. The clinical program for STIOLTO RESPIMAT included 7151 subjects with COPD in two 52-week active-controlled trials, one 12-week placebo-controlled trial, three 6-week placebo-controlled cross-over trials, and four additional trials of shorter duration. A total of 1988 subjects received at least 1 dose of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Adverse reactions observed in the ≤12-week trials were consistent with those observed in the 52-week trials, which formed the primary safety database. The primary safety database consisted of pooled data from the two 52-week double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group confirmatory clinical trials. These trials included 5162 adult COPD patients (72.9% males and 27.1% females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 1029 were treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT once daily. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT group was composed of mostly Caucasians (71.1%) with a mean age of 63.8 years and a mean percent predicted FEV1 at baseline of 43.2%. In these two trials, tiotropium 5 mcg and olodaterol 5 mcg were included as active control arms and no placebo was used. In these two clinical trials, 74% of patients exposed to STIOLTO RESPIMAT reported an adverse reaction compared to 76.6% and 73.3% in the olodaterol 5 mcg and tiotropium 5 mcg groups, respectively. The proportion of patients who discontinued due to an adverse reaction was 7.4% for STIOLTO RESPIMAT treated patients compared to 9.9% and 9.0% for olodaterol 5 mcg and tiotropium 5 mcg treated patients. The adverse reaction most commonly leading to discontinuation was worsening COPD. The most common serious adverse reactions were COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. Table 1 shows all adverse drug reactions that occurred with an incidence of >3% in the STIOLTO RESPIMAT treatment group and a higher incidence rate than the active comparator groups listed. Table 1: Number and frequency of adverse drug reactions greater than 3% (and higher than any of the comparators tiotropium and/or olodaterol) in COPD patients exposed to STIOLTO RESPIMAT: Pooled data from the two 52-week, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials in COPD patients 40 years of age and older Treatment STIOLTO RESPIMAT (once daily) Tiotropium (5 mcg once daily) Olodaterol (5 mcg once daily) Body system (adverse drug reaction) n=1029 n (%) n=1033 n (%) n=1038 n (%) Infections and infestations Nasopharyngitis 128 (12.4) 121 (11.7) 131 (12.6) Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders Cough 40 (3.9) 45 (4.4) 31 (3.0) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Back Pain 37 (3.6) 19 (1.8) 35 (3.4) Other adverse drug reactions in patients receiving STIOLTO RESPIMAT that occurred in ≤3% of patients in clinical studies are listed below: Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration Nervous system disorders: dizziness, insomnia Eye disorders: glaucoma, intraocular pressure increased, vision blurred Cardiac/vascular disorders: atrial fibrillation, palpitations, supraventricular tachycardia, tachycardia, hypertension Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis, pharyngitis, dysphonia, bronchospasm, laryngitis, sinusitis Gastrointestinal disorders: dry mouth, constipation, oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gingivitis, glossitis, stomatitis, intestinal obstruction including ileus paralytic Skin and subcutaneous disorders: rash, pruritus, angioneurotic edema, urticaria, skin infection, and skin ulcer, dry skin, hypersensitivity (including immediate reactions) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, joint swelling Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, dysuria, and urinary tract infection."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS LABA increase the risk of asthma related death. (5.1) Do not initiate STIOLTO RESPIMAT in acutely deteriorating COPD patients. (5.2) Do not use for relief of acute symptoms. Concomitant short-acting beta2-agonists can be used as needed for acute relief. (5.2) Do not exceed the recommended dose. Excessive use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT, or use in conjunction with other medications containing LABA can result in clinically significant cardiovascular effects and may be fatal. (5.3) Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue STIOLTO RESPIMAT at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. (5.4) Life-threatening paradoxical bronchospasm can occur. Discontinue STIOLTO RESPIMAT immediately. (5.5) Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, or sensitivity to sympathomimetic drugs. (5.6, 5.7) Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (5.8) Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (5.9) Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. (5.11) 5.1 Asthma-Related Death [See Boxed Warning] Data from a large placebo-controlled study in asthma patients showed that long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related death. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists. A 28-week, placebo-controlled US study comparing the safety of another long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.25, 15.34). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, including olodaterol, one of the active ingredients in STIOLTO RESPIMAT. No study adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in patients treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT has been conducted. The safety and efficacy of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in patients with asthma have not been established. STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [See Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be initiated in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD, which may be a life-threatening condition. STIOLTO RESPIMAT has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD. The use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in this setting is inappropriate. STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. STIOLTO RESPIMAT has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist. When beginning STIOLTO RESPIMAT, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing STIOLTO RESPIMAT, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta2-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated. COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If STIOLTO RESPIMAT no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or the patient’s inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalation of short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dosage of STIOLTO RESPIMAT beyond the recommended dose is not appropriate in this situation. 5.3 Excessive Use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT and Use With Other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists As with other inhaled drugs containing beta2-adrenergic agents, STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing long-acting beta2-agonists, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. 5.4 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue or throat), rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or itching may occur after administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine or its derivatives should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to STIOLTO RESPIMAT. 5.5 Paradoxical Bronchospasm As with other inhaled medicines, STIOLTO RESPIMAT may cause paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be stopped immediately and alternative therapy instituted. 5.6 Cardiovascular Effects Olodaterol, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If such effects occur, STIOLTO RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Long acting beta2-adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. 5.7 Coexisting Conditions Olodaterol, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, in patients with known or suspected prolongation of the QT interval, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. 5.8 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.9 Worsening of Urinary Retention STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.10 Renal Impairment Because tiotropium is a predominantly renally excreted drug, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of ≤60 mL/min) treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia Beta-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Inhalation of high doses of beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce increases in plasma glucose. In patients with severe COPD, hypokalemia may be potentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment [see Drug Interactions (7.2)], which may increase the susceptibility for cardiac arrhythmias. Clinically notable decreases in serum potassium or changes in blood glucose were infrequent during clinical studies with long-term administration of olodaterol with the rates similar to those for placebo controls. Olodaterol has not been investigated in patients whose diabetes mellitus is not well controlled."

SPIRIVA HandiHaler was studied in two 1-year placebo-controlled trials, two 1-year active-controlled trials, and two 6-month placebo-controlled trials in patients with COPD. In these trials, 1308 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HandiHaler at the recommended dose of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age ranging from 39 to 87 years with 65% to 85% males, 95% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) percent predicted of 39% to 43%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. An additional 6-month trial conducted in a Veteran's Affairs setting is not included in this safety database because only serious adverse events were collected. The most commonly reported adverse drug reaction was dry mouth. Dry mouth was usually mild and often resolved during continued treatment. Other reactions reported in individual patients and consistent with possible anticholinergic effects included constipation, tachycardia, blurred vision, glaucoma (new onset or worsening), dysuria, and urinary retention. Four multicenter, 1-year, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials evaluated SPIRIVA HandiHaler in patients with COPD. Table 1 shows all adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of ≥3% in the SPIRIVA HandiHaler group in the 1-year placebo-controlled trials where the rates in the SPIRIVA HandiHaler group exceeded placebo by ≥1%. The frequency of corresponding reactions in the ipratropium-controlled trials is included for comparison.

Other reactions that occurred in the SPIRIVA HandiHaler group at a frequency of 1% to 3% in the placebo-controlled trials where the rates exceeded that in the placebo group include: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, leg pain; Central and Peripheral Nervous System: dysphonia, paresthesia; Gastrointestinal System Disorders: gastrointestinal disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), gastroesophageal reflux, stomatitis (including ulcerative stomatitis); Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia; Musculoskeletal System Disorders: skeletal pain; Cardiac Events: angina pectoris (including aggravated angina pectoris); Psychiatric Disorder: depression; Infections: herpes zoster; Respiratory System Disorder (Upper): laryngitis; Vision Disorder: cataract. In addition, among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials with an incidence of <1% were atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, angioedema, and urinary retention. In the 1-year trials, the incidence of dry mouth, constipation, and urinary tract infection increased with age [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Two multicenter, 6-month, controlled studies evaluated SPIRIVA HandiHaler in patients with COPD. The adverse reactions and the incidence rates were similar to those seen in the 1-year controlled trials. 4-Year Trial The data described below reflect exposure to SPIRIVA HandiHaler in 5992 COPD patients in a 4-year placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, 2986 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HandiHaler at the recommended dose of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age range from 40 to 88 years, was 75% male, 90% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted of 40%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. When the adverse reactions were analyzed with a frequency of ≥3% in the SPIRIVA HandiHaler group where the rates in the SPIRIVA HandiHaler group exceeded placebo by ≥1%, adverse reactions included (SPIRIVA HandiHaler, placebo): pharyngitis (12.5%, 10.8%), sinusitis (6.5%, 5.3%), headache (5.7%, 4.5%), constipation (5.1%, 3.7%), dry mouth (5.1%, 2.7%), depression (4.4%, 3.3%), insomnia (4.4%, 3.0%), and arthralgia (4.2%, 3.1%). Additional Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions not previously listed that were reported more frequently in COPD patients treated with SPIRIVA HandiHaler than placebo include: dehydration, skin ulcer, stomatitis, gingivitis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, dry skin, skin infection, and joint swelling. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been identified during worldwide post-approval use of SPIRIVA HandiHaler. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are: application site irritation (glossitis, mouth ulceration, and pharyngolaryngeal pain), dizziness, dysphagia, hoarseness, intestinal obstruction including ileus paralytic, intraocular pressure increased, oral candidiasis, palpitations, pruritus, tachycardia, throat irritation, and urticaria."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidences in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. Since the same active ingredient (tiotropium bromide) is administered to COPD and asthma patients, prescribers and patients should take into account that the observed adverse reactions could be relevant for both patient populations independent of dosage strength. The most common adverse reactions in: COPD: (>3% incidence in the placebo-controlled trials with treatment durations of between 4 and 48 weeks) were pharyngitis, cough, dry mouth, and sinusitis. (6.1). Asthma: (>2% incidence in the placebo-controlled trials with treatment durations of between 12 and 52 weeks) were pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and headache in adults (6.2). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease The SPIRIVA RESPIMAT clinical development program included ten placebo controlled clinical trials in COPD. Two trials were four-week cross-over trials and eight were parallel group trials. The parallel group trials included a three week dose-ranging trial, two 12-week trials, three 48-week trials, and two trials of 4-week and 24-week duration conducted for a different program that contained tiotropium bromide 5 mcg treatment arms. The primary safety database consists of pooled data from the 7 randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 4-48 weeks in treatment duration. These trials included 6565 adult COPD patients (75% males and 25% females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 3282 patients were treated with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg and 3283 received placebo. The SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg group was composed mostly of Caucasians (78%) with a mean age of 65 years and a mean baseline percent predicted post-bronchodilator FEV1 of 46%. In these 7 clinical trials, 68.3% of patients exposed to SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg reported an adverse event compared to 68.7% of patients in the placebo group. There were 68 deaths in the SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg treatment group (2.1%) and 52 deaths (1.6%) in patients who received placebo [see Clinical Studies (14) Long-term active controlled mortality trial: Survival]. The percentage of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT patients who discontinued due to an adverse event were 7.3% compared to 10% with placebo patients. The percentage of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg patients who experienced a serious adverse event were 15.0% compared to 15.1% with placebo patients. In both groups, the adverse event most commonly leading to discontinuation was COPD exacerbation (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.0%, placebo 4.0%) which was also the most frequent serious adverse event. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were pharyngitis, cough, dry mouth, and sinusitis (Table 1). Other adverse reactions reported in individual patients and consistent with possible anticholinergic effects included constipation, dysuria, and urinary retention. Table 1 shows all adverse reactions that occurred with an incidence of >3% in the SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg treatment group, and a higher incidence rate on SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg than on placebo. Table 1 Number Percentage) of COPD Patients Exposed to SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg with Adverse Reactions >3% (and Higher than Placebo): Pooled Data from 7 Clinical Trials with Treatment Periods Ranging between 4 and 48 Weeks in COPD Patients *Adverse reactions include a grouping of similar terms Body System (Reaction)* SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg [n=3282] Placebo [n=3283] Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry mouth 134 (4.1) 52 (1.6) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 378 (11.5) 333 (10.1) Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Cough 190 (5.8) 182 (5.5) Sinusitis 103 (3.1) 88 (2.7) Other reactions that occurred in the SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg group at an incidence of 1% to 3% and at a higher incidence rate on SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg than on placebo included: Cardiac disorders: palpitations; Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation; gastroesophageal reflux disease; oropharyngeal candidiasis; Nervous system disorders: dizziness; Respiratory system disorders (Upper): dysphonia; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pruritus, rash; Renal and urinary disorders: urinary tract infection. Less Common Adverse Reactions Among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials with an incidence of <1% and at a higher incidence rate on SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg than on placebo were: dysphagia, gingivitis, intestinal obstruction including ileus paralytic, joint swelling, dysuria, urinary retention, epistaxis, laryngitis, angioedema, dry skin, skin infection, and skin ulcer. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Asthma Adult Patients SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg has been compared to placebo in four placebo-controlled parallel-group trials ranging from 12 to 52 weeks of treatment duration in adult patients (aged 18 to 75 years) with asthma. The safety data described below are based on one 1-year, two 6-month and one 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in a total of 2849 asthma patients on background treatment of at least ICS or ICS and long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA). Of these patients, 787 were treated with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT at the recommended dose of 2.5 mcg once-daily; 59.7% were female and 47.5% were Caucasian with a mean age of 43.7 years and a mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 90.0% at baseline. Table 2 shows all adverse reactions that occurred with an incidence of >2% in the SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg treatment group, and a higher incidence rate on SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg than on placebo. Table 2 Number (Percentage) of Asthma Patients Exposed to SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg with Adverse Reactions >2% (and Higher than Placebo): Pooled Data from 4 Adult Clinical Trials with Treatment Periods Ranging between 12 and 52 Weeks in Asthma Patients *Adverse reactions include a grouping of similar terms Body System (Reaction)* SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg [n=787] Placebo [n=735] Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Pharyngitis 125 (15.9) 91 (12.4) Sinusitis 21 (2.7) 10 (1.4) Bronchitis 26 (3.3) 10 (1.4) Nervous System Disorders Headache 30 (3.8) 20 (2.7) Other reactions that occurred in the SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg group at an incidence of 1% to 2% and at a higher incidence rate on SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg than on placebo included: Nervous system disorders: dizziness; Gastrointestinal disorders: oropharyngeal, candidiasis, diarrhea; Respiratory system disorders (Upper): cough, rhinitis allergic; Renal and urinary disorders: urinary tract infection; General disorders and administration site conditions: pyrexia; and Vascular disorders: hypertension. Less Common Adverse Reactions Among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials with an incidence of 0.5% to <1% and at a higher incidence rate on SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg than on placebo were: palpitations, dysphonia, acute tonsillitis, tonsillitis, rhinitis, herpes zoster, gastroesophageal reflux disease, oropharyngeal discomfort, abdominal pain upper, insomnia, hypersensitivity (including immediate reactions), angioedema, dehydration, arthralgia, muscle spasms, pain in extremity, chest pain, hepatic function abnormal, liver function test abnormal. Adolescent Patients Aged 12 to 17 years SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg has been compared to placebo in two placebo-controlled parallel-group trials ranging from 12 to 48 weeks of treatment duration in adolescent patients with asthma. The safety data described below are based on one 1-year and one 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in a total of 789 adolescent asthma patients on background treatment of at least ICS or ICS plus one or more controller. Of these patients, 252 were treated with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT at the recommended dose of 2.5 mcg once-daily; 63.9% were male and 95.6% were Caucasian with a mean age of 14.3 years and a mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 of 98.3% at baseline. The adverse reaction profile for adolescent patients with asthma was comparable to that observed in adult patients with asthma. SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg also has been compared to placebo in seven placebo-controlled parallel-group trials ranging from 12 to 52 weeks of treatment duration in 4149 adult patients (aged 18 to 75 years) with asthma and in two placebo-controlled parallel-group trials ranging from 12 to 48 weeks of treatment duration in 789 adolescent patients (1370 adults and 264 adolescents receiving SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg once-daily). The adverse reaction profile for SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg in patients with asthma was comparable to that observed with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 2.5 mcg in patients with asthma. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions observed during the SPIRIVA RESPIMAT clinical trials in COPD, the following adverse reactions have been identified during the worldwide use of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT 5 mcg and another tiotropium formulation, SPIRIVA® HandiHaler® (tiotropium bromide inhalation powder): glaucoma, intraocular pressure increased, vision blurred, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, bronchospasm, glossitis, stomatitis, dehydration, insomnia, hypersensitivity (including immediate reactions), and urticaria."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Not for acute use, i.e., not a rescue medication (5.1) Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue SPIRIVA RESPIMAT at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. (5.2) Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue SPIRIVA RESPIMAT and consider other treatments if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs. (5.3) Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (5.4) Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patient to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (5.5) 5.1 Not for Acute Use SPIRIVA RESPIMAT is intended as a once-daily maintenance treatment for COPD and asthma and should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. In the event of an acute attack, a rapid-acting beta2-agonist should be used. 5.2 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue or throat), rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or itching may occur after administration of SPIRIVA RESPIMAT. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine or its derivatives should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to SPIRIVA RESPIMAT. 5.3 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Inhaled medicines, including SPIRIVA RESPIMAT, may cause paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist such as albuterol. Treatment with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT should be stopped and other treatments considered. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma SPIRIVA RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.5 Worsening of Urinary Retention SPIRIVA RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.6 Renal Impairment As a predominantly renally excreted drug, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with SPIRIVA RESPIMAT should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

SPIRIVA HANDIHALER was studied in two 1-year placebo-controlled trials, two 1-year active-controlled trials, and two 6-month placebo-controlled trials in patients with COPD. In these trials, 1308 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at the recommended dose of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age ranging from 39 to 87 years with 65% to 85% males, 95% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) percent predicted of 39% to 43%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. An additional 6-month trial conducted in a Veteran’s Affairs setting is not included in this safety database because only serious adverse events were collected. The most commonly reported adverse drug reaction was dry mouth. Dry mouth was usually mild and often resolved during continued treatment. Other reactions reported in individual patients and consistent with possible anticholinergic effects included constipation, tachycardia, blurred vision, glaucoma (new onset or worsening), dysuria, and urinary retention. Four multicenter, 1-year, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials evaluated SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in patients with COPD. Table 1 shows all adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of ≥3% in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group in the 1-year placebo-controlled trials where the rates in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group exceeded placebo by ≥1%. The frequency of corresponding reactions in the ipratropium-controlled trials is included for comparison.

Other reactions that occurred in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group at a frequency of 1% to 3% in the placebo-controlled trials where the rates exceeded that in the placebo group include: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, leg pain; Central and Peripheral Nervous System: dysphonia, paresthesia; Gastrointestinal System Disorders: gastrointestinal disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), gastroesophageal reflux, stomatitis (including ulcerative stomatitis); Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia; Musculoskeletal System Disorders: skeletal pain; Cardiac Events: angina pectoris (including aggravated angina pectoris); Psychiatric Disorder: depression; Infections: herpes zoster; Respiratory System Disorder (Upper): laryngitis; Vision Disorder: cataract. In addition, among the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials with an incidence of <1% were atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, angioedema, and urinary retention. In the 1-year trials, the incidence of dry mouth, constipation, and urinary tract infection increased with age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Two multicenter, 6-month, controlled studies evaluated SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in patients with COPD. The adverse reactions and the incidence rates were similar to those seen in the 1-year controlled trials. 4-Year Trial The data described below reflect exposure to SPIRIVA HANDIHALER in 5992 COPD patients in a 4-year placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, 2986 patients were treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER at the recommended dose of 18 mcg once a day. The population had an age range from 40 to 88 years, was 75% male, 90% Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted of 40%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, or symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from these trials. When the adverse reactions were analyzed with a frequency of ≥3% in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group where the rates in the SPIRIVA HANDIHALER group exceeded placebo by ≥1%, adverse reactions included (SPIRIVA HANDIHALER, placebo): pharyngitis (12.5%, 10.8%), sinusitis (6.5%, 5.3%), headache (5.7%, 4.5%), constipation (5.1%, 3.7%), dry mouth (5.1%, 2.7%), depression (4.4%, 3.3%), insomnia (4.4%, 3.0%), and arthralgia (4.2%, 3.1%). Additional Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions not previously listed that were reported more frequently in COPD patients treated with SPIRIVA HANDIHALER than placebo include: dehydration, skin ulcer, stomatitis, gingivitis, oropharyngeal candidiasis, dry skin, skin infection, and joint swelling. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been identified during worldwide post-approval use of SPIRIVA HANDIHALER. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are: application site irritation (glossitis, mouth ulceration, and pharyngolaryngeal pain), dizziness, dysphagia, hoarseness, intestinal obstruction including ileus paralytic, intraocular pressure increased, oral candidiasis, palpitations, pruritus, tachycardia, throat irritation, and urticaria."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are: application site irritation (glossitis, mouth ulceration, and pharyngolaryngeal pain), dizziness, dysphagia, hoarseness, intestinal obstruction including ileus paralytic, intraocular pressure increased, oral candidiasis, palpitations, pruritus, tachycardia, throat irritation, and urticaria."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Not for acute use: Not for use as a rescue medication (5.1) Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue SPIRIVA HandiHaler at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. Use with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. (5.2) Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue SPIRIVA HandiHaler and consider other treatments if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs (5.3) Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (5.4) Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (5.5) 5.1 Not for Acute Use SPIRIVA HandiHaler is intended as a once-daily maintenance treatment for COPD and is not indicated for the initial treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm (i.e., rescue therapy). 5.2 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or itching, may occur after administration of SPIRIVA HandiHaler. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with SPIRIVA HandiHaler should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to SPIRIVA HandiHaler. In addition, SPIRIVA HandiHaler should be used with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. 5.3 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Inhaled medicines, including SPIRIVA HandiHaler, can produce paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, treatment with SPIRIVA HandiHaler should be stopped and other treatments considered. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma SPIRIVA HandiHaler should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.5 Worsening of Urinary Retention SPIRIVA HandiHaler should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.6 Renal Impairment As a predominantly renally excreted drug, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of ≤50 mL/min) treated with SPIRIVA HandiHaler should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."
