Rarely, a severe, immediate-type, apparently hyperallergic corneal reaction may occur which includes acute, intense and diffuse epithelial keratitis; a gray, ground-glass appearance; sloughing of large areas of necrotic epithelium; corneal filaments and, sometimes, iritis with descemetitis.

Softening and erosion of the corneal epithelium and conjunctival congestion and hemorrhage have been reported."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS: Avoid contamination - do not touch tip of sterile dropper used to dispense solution to any surface. Replace container closure immediately after using. Prolonged use of a topical ocular anesthetic is not recommended. It may product permanent corneal opacification with accompanying visual loss. PRECAUTIONS: This product should be used cautiously and sparingly in patients with known allergies, cardiac disease, or hyperthyroidism. The long-term toxicity is unknown; prolonged use may possibly delay wound healing. Although exceedingly rare with ophthalmic application of local anesthetics, it should be borne in mind that systemic toxicity manifested by central nervous system stimulation followed by depression may occur. Protection of the eye from irritating chemicals, foreign bodies and rubbing during the period of anesthesia is very important. Tonometers soaked in sterilizing or detergent solutions should be thoroughly rinsed with sterile distilled water prior to use. Patients should be advised to avoid touching the eye until the anesthesia has worn off."
