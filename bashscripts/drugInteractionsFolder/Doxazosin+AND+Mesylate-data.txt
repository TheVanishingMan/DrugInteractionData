        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day one of a 4-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin tablets with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) The incidence of adverse events has been ascertained from worldwide clinical trials in 965 BPH patients. The incidence rates presented below (Table 3) are based on combined data from seven placebo-controlled trials involving once daily administration of doxazosin in doses of 1 mg to 16 mg in hypertensives and 0.5 mg to 8 mg in normotensives. The adverse events when the incidence in the doxazosin group was at least 1% are summarized in Table 3. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events compared to placebo was seen except for dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, edema and dyspnea. Dizziness and dyspnea appeared to be dose-related.

These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%); and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to 3 years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin were mild. Hypertension Doxazosin mesylate has been administered to approximately 4,000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1,679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studies involving once daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1 mg to 16 mg. Table 4 summarizes those adverse experiences (possibly/probably related) reported for patients in these hypertension studies where the prevalence rate in the doxazosin group was at least 0.5% or where the reaction is of particular interest.

The following adverse reactions occurred with a frequency of between 0.5% and 1%: syncope, hypoesthesia, increased sweating, agitation, increased weight. The following additional adverse reactions were reported by < 0.5% of 3,960 patients who received doxazosin in controlled or open, short- or long-term clinical studies, including international studies. Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Autonomic Nervous System: pallor; Metabolic: thirst, gout, hypokalemia; Hematopoietic: lymphadenopathy, purpura; Reproductive System: breast pain; Skin Disorders: alopecia, dry skin, eczema; Central Nervous System: paresis, tremor, twitching, confusion, migraine, impaired concentration; Psychiatric: paroniria, amnesia, emotional lability, abnormal thinking, depersonalization; Special Senses: parosmia, earache, taste perversion, photophobia, abnormal lacrimation; Gastrointestinal System: increased appetite, anorexia, fecal incontinence, gastroenteritis; Respiratory System: bronchospasm, sinusitis, coughing, pharyngitis; Urinary System: renal calculus; General Body System: hot flushes, back pain, infection, fever/rigors, decreased weight, influenza-like symptoms. Doxazosin has not been associated with any clinically significant changes in routine biochemical tests. No clinically relevant adverse effects were noted on serum potassium, serum glucose, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine or liver function tests. Doxazosin has been associated with decreases in white blood cell counts (see PRECAUTIONS: Leukopenia/Neutropenia). In post-marketing experience, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported: Autonomic Nervous System: priapism; Central Nervous System: hypoesthesia; Endocrine System: gynecomastia; Gastrointestinal System: vomiting; General Body System: allergic reaction; Heart Rate/Rhythm: bradycardia; Hematopoietic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; Liver/Biliary System: hepatitis, hepatitis cholestatic; Respiratory System: bronchospasm aggravated; Skin Disorders: urticaria; Special Senses: Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Cataract Surgery); Urinary System: hematuria, micturition disorder, micturition frequency, nocturia."

In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin mesylate tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin mesylate tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin mesylate with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin mesylate vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%); and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin mesylate were mild. Hypertension Doxazosin mesylate has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin mesylate to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue/malaise.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS A. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) The incidence of adverse events has been ascertained from worldwide clinical trials in 965 BPH patients. The incidence rates presented below (Table 3) are based on combined data from seven placebo-controlled trials involving once-daily administration of doxazosin in doses of 1 to 16 mg in hypertensives and 0.5 to 8 mg in normotensives. The adverse events when the incidence in the doxazosin group was at least 1% are summarized in Table 3. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events compared to placebo was seen except for dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, edema, and dyspnea. Dizziness and dyspnea appeared to be dose-related.

These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%); and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin were mild. B. Hypertension Doxazosin has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studies involving once-daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1 to 16 mg.

Doxazosin tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin tablets with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin mesylate vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%), and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin mesylate were mild. B. Hypertension Doxazosin mesylate has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin mesylate to placebo there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studies involving once daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1-16 mg. Table 4 summarizes those adverse experiences (possibly/probably related) reported for patients in these hypertension studies where the prevalence rate in the doxazosin group was at least 0.5% or where the reaction is of particular interest.

The following adverse reactions occurred with a frequency of between 0.5% and 1%: syncope, hypoesthesia, increased sweating, agitation, increased weight. The following additional adverse reactions were reported by <0.5% of 3960 patients who received doxazosin in controlled or open, short- or long-term clinical studies, including international studies. Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Autonomic Nervous System: pallor; Metabolic: thirst, gout, hypokalemia; Hematopoietic: lymphadenopathy, purpura; Reproductive System: breast pain; Skin Disorders: alopecia, dry skin, eczema; Central Nervous System: paresis, tremor, twitching, confusion, migraine, impaired concentration; Psychiatric: paroniria, amnesia, emotional lability, abnormal thinking, depersonalization; Special Senses: parosmia, earache, taste perversion, photophobia, abnormal lacrimation; Gastrointestinal System: increased appetite, anorexia, fecal incontinence, gastroenteritis; Respiratory System: bronchospasm, sinusitis, coughing, pharyngitis; Urinary System: renal calculus; General Body System: hot flushes, back pain, infection, fever/rigors, decreased weight, influenza-like symptoms. Doxazosin mesylate has not been associated with any clinically significant changes in routine biochemical tests. No clinically relevant adverse effects were noted on serum potassium, serum glucose, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine or liver function tests. Doxazosin mesylate has been associated with decreases in white blood cell counts (see PRECAUTIONS, Leukopenia/Neutropenia). In post-marketing experience the following additional adverse reactions have been reported: Autonomic Nervous System: priapism; Central Nervous System: hypoesthesia; Endocrine System: gynecomastia; Gastrointestinal System: vomiting; General Body System: allergic reaction; Heart Rate/Rhythm: bradycardia; Hematopoietic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; Liver/Biliary System: hepatitis, hepatitis cholestatic; Respiratory System: bronchospasm aggravated; Skin Disorders: urticaria; Special Senses: Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS, Cataract Surgery); Urinary System: hematuria, micturition disorder, micturition frequency, nocturia."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin mesylate has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein-bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin mesylate has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin mesylate tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin mesylate tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin mesylate with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Cardiac Toxicity in Animals An increased incidence of myocardial necrosis or fibrosis was displayed by Sprague-Dawley rats after 6 months of dietary administration at concentrations calculated to provide 80 mg doxazosin/kg/day, and after 12 months of dietary administration at concentrations calculated to provide 40 mg doxazosin/kg/day (AUC exposure in rats 8 times the human AUC exposure with a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose). Myocardial fibrosis was observed in both rats and mice treated in the same manner with 40 mg doxazosin/kg/day for 18 months (exposure 8 times human AUC exposure in rats and somewhat equivalent to human Cmax exposure in mice). No cardiotoxicity was observed at lower doses (up to 10 or 20 mg/kg/day, depending on the study) in either species. These lesions were not observed after 12 months of oral dosing in dogs at maximum doses of 20 mg/kg/day [maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) in dogs 14 times the Cmax exposure in humans receiving a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose] and in Wistar rats at doses of 100 mg/kg/day (Cmax exposures 15 times human Cmax exposure with a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose). There is no evidence that similar lesions occur in humans."

Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%), and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin were mild. B. Hypertension Doxazosin has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studies involving once-daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1 to 16 mg. Table 4 summarizes those adverse experiences (possibly/probably related) reported for patients in these hypertension studies where the prevalence rate in the doxazosin group was at least 0.5% or where the reaction is of particular interest.

        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a 4-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin tablets with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

Cardiac Toxicity in Animals An increased incidence of myocardial necrosis or fibrosis was displayed by Sprague-Dawley rats after 6 months of dietary administration at concentrations calculated to provide 80 mg doxazosin/kg/day and after 12 months of dietary administration at concentrations calculated to provide 40 mg doxazosin/kg/day (AUC exposure in rats 8 times the human AUC exposure with a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose).

No cardiotoxicity was observed at lower doses (up to 10 or 20 mg/kg/day, depending on the study) in either species. These lesions were not observed after 12 months of oral dosing in dogs at maximum doses of 20 mg/kg/day [maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) in dogs 14 times the Cmax exposure in humans receiving a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose] and in Wistar rats at doses of 100 mg/kg/day (Cmax exposures 15 times human Cmax exposure with a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose).

        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day one of a 4-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin tablets with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

Doxazosin mesylate has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin mesylate tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin mesylate tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies.

Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin mesylate vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System : angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System : dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%); and Psychiatric Disorders : libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin mesylate were mild. Hypertension Doxazosin mesylate has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group.

In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin mesylate to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studies involving once-daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1-16 mg.

        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin mesylate has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein-bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin mesylate has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin mesylate tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin mesylate tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin mesylate with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events has been ascertained from worldwide clinical trials in 965 BPH patients. The incidence rates presented below (Table 3) are based on combined data from seven placebo-controlled trials involving once-daily administration of doxazosin in doses of 1 to 16 mg in hypertensives and 0.5 to 8 mg in normotensives. The adverse events when the incidence in the doxazosin group was at least 1% are summarized in Table 3. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events compared to placebo was seen except for dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, edema, and dyspnea.

These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%); and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin were mild. Doxazosin has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related.

        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin mesylate has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein-bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin mesylate has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin mesylate tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin mesylate tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin mesylate with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a 4-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies.

These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are ( Doxazosin mesylate vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%); and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with Doxazosin mesylate were mild. B. Hypertension Doxazosin mesylate has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing Doxazosin mesylate to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events has been ascertained from worldwide clinical trials in 965 BPH patients. The incidence rates presented below (TABLE 3) are based on combined data from seven placebo-controlled trials involving once-daily administration of doxazosin mesylate in doses of 1 to 16 mg in hypertensives and 0.5 to 8 mg in normotensives. The adverse events when the incidence in the doxazosin mesylate group was at least 1% are summarized in TABLE 3. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events compared to placebo was seen except for dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, edema, and dyspnea. Dizziness and dyspnea appeared to be dose-related.

These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin mesylate vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System : angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System : dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%); and Psychiatric Disorders : libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin mesylate were mild. Doxazosin mesylate has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin mesylate to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studies involving once-daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1 to 16 mg. TABLE 4 summarizes those adverse experiences (possibly/probably related) reported for patients in these hypertension studies where the prevalence rate in the doxazosin group was at least 0.5% or where the reaction is of particular interest.

The following additional adverse reactions were reported by < 0.5% of 3960 patients who received doxazosin in controlled or open, short- or long-term clinical studies, including international studies. Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Autonomic Nervous System : pallor; Metabolic : thirst, gout, hypokalemia; Hematopoietic : lymphadenopathy, purpura; Reproductive System : breast pain; Skin Disorders : alopecia, dry skin, eczema; Central Nervous System : paresis, tremor, twitching, confusion, migraine, impaired concentration; Psychiatric : paroniria, amnesia, emotional lability, abnormal thinking, depersonalization; Special Senses : parosmia, earache, taste perversion, photophobia, abnormal lacrimation; Gastrointestinal System : increased appetite, anorexia, fecal incontinence, gastroenteritis; Respiratory System : bronchospasm, sinusitis, coughing, pharyngitis; Urinary System : renal calculus; General Body System : hot flushes, back pain, infection, fever/rigors, decreased weight, influenza-like symptoms. Doxazosin mesylate has not been associated with any clinically significant changes in routine biochemical tests. No clinically relevant adverse effects were noted on serum potassium, serum glucose, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine or liver function tests. Doxazosin mesylate has been associated with decreases in white blood cell counts (see PRECAUTIONS, Leukopenia/Neutropenia). In postmarketing experience, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported: Autonomic Nervous System : priapism; Central Nervous System : hypoesthesia; Endocrine System : gynecomastia; Gastrointestinal System : vomiting; General Body System : allergic reaction; Heart Rate/Rhythm : bradycardia; Hematopoietic : leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; Liver/Biliary System : hepatitis, hepatitis cholestatic; Respiratory System : bronchospasm aggravated; Skin Disorders : urticaria; Special Senses : Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (see PRECAUTIONS, Cataract Surgery); Urinary System : hematuria, micturition disorder, micturition frequency, nocturia."

        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin mesylate has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein-bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin mesylate has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin mesylate tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin mesylate tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin mesylate with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

Dizziness and dyspnea appeared to be dose-related.In these placebo-controlled studies of 665 doxazosin patients, treated for a mean of 85 days, additional adverse reactions have been reported. These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%), and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin were mild. HypertensionDoxazosin mesylate has been administered to approximately 4,000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1,679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin to placebo there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studies involving once daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1 to 16 mg. Table 4 summarizes those adverse experiences (possibly/probably related) reported for patients in these hypertension studies where the prevalence rate in the doxazosin group was at least 0.5% or where the reaction is of particular interest."

In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day one of a 4-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies.

Myocardial fibrosis was observed in both rats and mice treated in the same manner with 40 mg doxazosin/kg/day for 18 months (exposure 8 times human AUC exposure in rats and somewhat equivalent to human Cmax exposure in mice). No cardiotoxicity was observed at lower doses (up to 10 or 20 mg/kg/day, depending on the study) in either species. These lesions were not observed after 12 months of oral dosing in dogs at maximum doses of 20 mg/kg/day [maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) in dogs 14 times the Cmax exposure in humans receiving a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose] and in Wistar rats at doses of 100 mg/kg/day (Cmax exposures 15 times human Cmax exposure with a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose).

The following additional adverse reactions were reported by < 0.5% of 3960 patients who received doxazosin in controlled or open, short- or long-term clinical studies, including international studies. Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Autonomic Nervous System : pallor; Metabolic : thirst, gout, hypokalemia; Hematopoietic : lymphadenopathy, purpura; Reproductive System : breast pain; Skin Disorders : alopecia, dry skin, eczema; Central Nervous System : paresis, tremor, twitching, confusion, migraine, impaired concentration; Psychiatric : paroniria, amnesia, emotional lability, abnormal thinking, depersonalization; Special Senses : parosmia, earache, taste perversion, photophobia, abnormal lacrimation; Gastrointestinal System : increased appetite, anorexia, fecal incontinence, gastroenteritis; Respiratory System : bronchospasm, sinusitis, coughing, pharyngitis; Urinary System : renal calculus; General Body System : hot flushes, back pain, infection, fever/rigors, decreased weight, influenza-like symptoms. Doxazosin mesylate has not been associated with any clinically significant changes in routine biochemical tests. No clinically relevant adverse effects were noted on serum potassium, serum glucose, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine or liver function tests. Doxazosin mesylate has been associated with decreases in white blood cell counts (see PRECAUTIONS, Leukopenia/Neutropenia).

(7.1) Concomitant administration of CARDURA XL with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension. (7.3) 7.1 CYP 3A4 Inhibitors No in vivo drug interaction studies were conducted with CARDURA XL. In vitro studies suggest that doxazosin is a substrate of CYP 3A4. Caution should be exercised when concomitantly administering CARDURA XL with a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, such as atanazavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Antihypertensive Medications Pharmacodynamic interactions between CARDURA XL and antihypertensive medications or other vasodilating agents have not been determined. 7.3 PDE-5 Inhibitors Concomitant administration of CARDURA XL with a PDE-5 inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions from clinical trials are asthenia, headache, hypotension, and dizziness. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The incidence of adverse reactions was derived from two controlled efficacy and safety trials involving 1473 BPH patients. In Study 1, CARDURA XL (n=317) was compared to doxazosin IR tablets (n=322) and to placebo (n=156). In Study 2, CARDURA XL (n=350) was compared just to doxazosin IR tablets (n=330). In both of these studies, CARDURA XL was initiated at a dose of 4 mg, which could be increased by the investigator to 8 mg after seven weeks if an adequate response was not seen [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Similarly, doxazosin IR was begun at a dose of 1 mg, which was increased in all patients to 2 mg after 1 week, followed by the option to increase to 4 mg after 4 weeks, and 8 mg after 7 weeks. The most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the CARDURA XL group were: dizziness, dyspnea, asthenia, headache, hypotension, postural hypotension, and somnolence. The rates of discontinuation for adverse reactions were 6%, 7% and 3% in the CARDURA XL, doxazosin IR, and placebo groups, respectively. Table 1 lists the incidence rates of adverse reactions derived from all reported adverse events in the two controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) combined, at a rate greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with CARDURA XL. TABLE 1 Adverse Reactions, Derived from All Adverse Events Exceeding Placebo Rate and Occurring in â‰¥1% of BPH Patients Treated with CARDURA XL Body System CARDURA XL (N = 666) Doxazosin IR (N = 651) Placebo (N = 156) BODY AS A WHOLE Abdominal Pain 1.8% 2.3% 0.6% Asthenia 3.9% 6.9% 1.3% Headache 6.0% 5.1% 4.5% CARDIOVASCULAR Hypotension 1.7% 1.8% 0.0% Postural Hypotension 1.2% 2.2% 0.6% DIGESTIVE Dyspepsia 1.4% 1.2% 0.0% Nausea 1.2% 2.3% 0.6% MUSCULOSKELETAL Myalgia 1.4% 0.5% 0.0% NERVOUS Dizziness 5.3% 9.1% 1.9% Somnolence 1.5% 1.2% 0.0% Vertigo 1.5% 4.1% 0.6% RESPIRATORY Dyspnea 1.2% 1.2% 0.0% Respiratory Tract Infection 4.8% 4.5% 1.9% UROGENITAL Urinary Tract Infection 1.4% 0.8% 0.6% Additional adverse events reported with CARDURA XL, reported by less than 1% of patients, and those of clinical interest include: Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris, syncope, tachycardia, chest pain, palpitations; Digestive System: diarrhea; Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia; Nervous System: libido decreased; Urogenital System: impotence, dysuria. In general, the adverse events reported in the open-label safety extension, in approximately 295 BPH patients treated for up to 37 weeks, were similar in type and frequency to the events described above in the controlled trials. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of doxazosin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Autonomic Nervous System: priapism; Cardiovascular System: cerebrovascular accidents, dizziness postural, myocardial infarction; Central and Peripheral Nervous System: hypoesthesia, paresthesia; Endocrine System: gynecomastia; Gastrointestinal System: gastrointestinal obstruction, vomiting; General Body System: fatigue, hot flushes, malaise; Heart Rate/Rhythm: bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias; Hematopoietic: leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia; Liver/Biliary System: abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis, hepatitis cholestatic, jaundice; Musculoskeletal System: muscle cramps, muscle weakness; Psychiatric: agitation, anorexia, nervousness; Respiratory System: bronchospasm aggravated; Skin Disorders: alopecia, urticaria, skin rash, pruritus; Special Senses: blurred vision, Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]; Urinary System: hematuria, micturition disorder, micturition frequency, nocturia, polyuria. There have been rare reports of gastrointestinal irritation and gastrointestinal bleeding with use of another drug in this non-deformable sustained release formulation, although causal relationship to the drug is uncertain."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Postural hypotension with or without syncope may occur in the first few hours after administration. (5.1) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken CARDURA XL tablets. (5.2) Caution should be used when administering to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing or coronary insufficiency. (5.3, 5.7) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. (5.4) 5.1 Postural Hypotension Postural hypotension with or without symptoms (e.g., dizziness) may develop within a few hours following administration of CARDURA XL. However, infrequently, symptomatic postural hypotension has also been reported later than a few hours after dosing. As with other alpha-blockers, there is a potential for syncope, especially after the initial dose or after an increase in dosage strength. Patients should be warned of the possible occurrence of such events and should avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur. Care should be taken when CARDURA XL is administered to patients with symptomatic hypotension or patients who have had a hypotensive response to other medications. 5.2 Cataract Surgery Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha1 blockers. This variant of small pupil syndrome is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's surgeon should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. There does not appear to be a benefit from stopping alpha1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders As with any other non-deformable material, caution should be used when administering CARDURA XL to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of another drug in this non-deformable extended release formulation. Markedly increased GI retention times, as may occur in patients with chronic constipation, can increase systemic exposure to doxazosin and thereby potentially increase adverse reactions. 5.4 Prostate Cancer Carcinoma of the prostate causes many of the same symptoms associated with BPH and the two disorders frequently co-exist. Carcinoma of the prostate should therefore be ruled out prior to commencing therapy with CARDURA XL. 5.5 PDE-5 Inhibitors Concomitant administration of CARDURA XL with a PDE-5 inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension. Pharmacodynamic interactions between CARDURA XL and antihypertensive medications or other vasodilating agents have not been determined. 5.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment CARDURA XL is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be administered with caution to patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.7 Patients with Coronary Insufficiency Patients with congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, or acute myocardial infarction within the last 6 months were excluded from the Phase 3 studies. If symptoms of angina pectoris should newly appear or worsen, CARDURA XL should be discontinued. 5.8 CYP 3A4 Inhibitors Caution should be exercised when concomitantly administering CARDURA XL with a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, such as atanazavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole. 5.9 Priapism Rarely (probably less frequently than once in every several thousand patients), alpha-1 antagonists, including doxazosin, have been associated with priapism (painful penile erection, sustained for hours and unrelieved by sexual intercourse or masturbation). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not promptly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events has been ascertained from worldwide clinical trials in 965 BPH patients. The incidence rates presented below (Table 3) are based on combined data from seven placebo-controlled trials involving once-daily administration of doxazosin mesylate tablet in doses of 1â€“16 mg in hypertensives and 0.5â€“8 mg in normotensives. The adverse events when the incidence in the doxazosin mesylate tablet group was at least 1% are summarized in Table 3. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events compared to placebo was seen except for dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, edema, and dyspnea.

The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin mesylate tablet were mild. Doxazosin mesylate tablet has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin mesylate tablet to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related.

        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin mesylate has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein-bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin mesylate has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin mesylate tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin mesylate tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin mesylate with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a 4-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, doxazosin tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of doxazosin tablets with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) The incidence of adverse events has been ascertained from worldwide clinical trials in 965 BPH patients. The incidence rates presented below (Table 3) are based on combined data from seven placebo-controlled trials involving once daily administration of doxazosin in doses of 1 mg to 16 mg in hypertensives and 0.5 mg to 8 mg in normotensives. The adverse events when the incidence in the doxazosin group was at least 1% are summarized in Table 3.

These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%), and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin were mild. Hypertension Doxazosin mesylate has been administered to approximately 4,000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1,679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin to placebo there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose related.

        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that CARDURA has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein- bound drugs on doxazosin binding. CARDURA has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p=0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, CARDURA tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. CARDURA tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies.

The adverse events when the incidence in the CARDURA group was at least 1% are summarized in Table 3.

These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (CARDURA vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%); and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with CARDURA were mild. B. Hypertension CARDURA has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing CARDURA to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The incidence of adverse events has been ascertained from worldwide clinical trials in 965 BPH patients. The incidence rates presented below (Table 3) are based on combined data from seven placebo-controlled trials involving once-daily administration of doxazosin in doses of 1 to 16 mg in hypertensives and 0.5 to 8 mg in normotensives. The adverse events when the incidence in the doxazosin group was at least 1% are summarized in Table 3. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events compared to placebo was seen except for dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, edema, and dyspnea. Dizziness and dyspnea appeared to be dose-related.

These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%), postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs. 1.3%); and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years was similar to that in the placebo-controlled studies. The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin were mild. Doxazosin has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation of treatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuation were postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%. In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin to placebo, there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence, and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related.

        "Drug Interactions Most (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that Doxazosin mesylate has no effect on protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein- bound drugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin mesylate has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patients receiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p=0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown. In clinical trials, Doxazosin mesylate tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formal interaction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin mesylate tablets have been used with the following drugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen, indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and flu remedies. Concomitant administration of Doxazosin mesylate with a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug InteractionsMost (98%) of plasma doxazosin is protein bound. In vitro data in human plasma indicate that doxazosin has no effect on proteinbinding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin or indomethacin. There is no information on the effect of other highly plasma protein bounddrugs on doxazosin binding. Doxazosin has been administered without any evidence of an adverse drug interaction to patientsreceiving thiazide diuretics, beta-blocking agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a placebo-controlled trial in normalvolunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a 4-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily)resulted in a 10% increase in mean AUC of doxazosin (p = 0.006), and a slight but not statistically significant increase in mean Cmaxand mean half-life of doxazosin. The clinical significance of this increase in doxazosin AUC is unknown.In clinical trials, doxazosin tablets have been administered to patients on a variety of concomitant medications; while no formalinteraction studies have been conducted, no interactions were observed. Doxazosin tablets have been used with the followingdrugs or drug classes: 1) analgesic/anti-inflammatory (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine and codeine combinations, ibuprofen,indomethacin); 2) antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin); 3) antihistamines (e.g.,chlorpheniramine); 4) cardiovascular agents (e.g., atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol); 5) corticosteroids; 6) gastrointestinalagents (e.g., antacids); 7) hypoglycemics and endocrine drugs; 8) sedatives and tranquilizers (e.g., diazepam); 9) cold and fluremedies.Cardiac Toxicity in AnimalsAn increased incidence of myocardial necrosis or fibrosis was displayed by Sprague-Dawley rats after 6 months of dietaryadministration at concentrations calculated to provide 80 mg doxazosin/kg/day and after 12 months of dietary administration atconcentrations calculated to provide 40 mg doxazosin/kg/day (AUC exposure in rats 8 times the human AUC exposure with a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose). Myocardial fibrosis was observed in both rats and mice treated in the same manner with 40 mg doxazosin/kg/day for 18 months (exposure 8 times human AUC exposure in rats and somewhat equivalent to human Cmax exposure in mice). Nocardiotoxicity was observed at lower doses (up to 10 or 20 mg/kg/day, depending on the study) in either species. These lesions werenot observed after 12 months of oral dosing in dogs at maximum doses of 20 mg/kg/day [maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax)in dogs 14 times the Cmax exposure in humans receiving a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose] and in Wistar rats at doses of 100 mg/kg/day(Cmax exposures 15 times human Cmax exposure with a 12 mg/day therapeutic dose). There is no evidence that similar lesions occur inhumans.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityChronic dietary administration (up to 24 months) of doxazosin mesylate at maximally tolerated doses of 40 mg/kg/day in rats and120 mg/kg/day in mice revealed no evidence of carcinogenic potential. The highest doses evaluated in the rat and mouse studies areassociated with AUCs (a measure of systemic exposure) that are 8 times and 4 times, respectively, the human AUC at a dose of 16mg/day.Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug- or metabolite-related effects at either chromosomal or subchromosomal levels.Studies in rats showed reduced fertility in males treated with doxazosin at oral doses of 20 (but not 5 or 10) mg/kg/day, about 4 timesthe AUC exposures obtained with a 12 mg/day human dose. This effect was reversible within two weeks of drug withdrawal. Therehave been no reports of any effects of doxazosin on male fertility in humans."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS ADVERSE REACTIONSBenign Prostatic HyperplasiaThe incidence of adverse events has been ascertained from worldwide clinical trials in 965 BPH patients. The incidence ratespresented below (Table 3) are based on combined data from seven placebo-controlled trials involving once daily administration ofdoxazosin in doses of 1 to 16 mg in hypertensives and 0.5 to 8 mg in normotensives. The adverse events when the incidence in thedoxazosin group was at least 1% are summarized in Table 3. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events compared toplacebo was seen except for dizziness, fatigue, hypotension, edema and dyspnea. Dizziness and dyspnea appeared to be dose-related.TABLE 3 ADVERSE REACTIONS DURING PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDIES BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Body System DOXAZOSIN(N=665) PLACEBO(N=300) BODY AS A WHOLE Back pain 1.8% 2.0% Chest Pain 1.2% 0.7% Fatigue 8.0%* 1.7% Headache 9.9% 9.0% Influenza-like symptoms 1.1% 1.0% Pain 2.0% 1.0% CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Hypotension 1.7%* 0.0% Palpitation 1.2% 0.3% DIGESTIVE SYSTEM Abdominal Pain 2.4% 2.0% Diarrhea 2.3% 2.0% Dyspepsia 1.7% 1.7% Nausea 1.5% 0.7% METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONALDISORDERS Edema 2.7%* 0.7% NERVOUS SYSTEM Dizziness206 15.6%* 9.0% Mouth Dry 1.4% 0.3% Somnolence 3.0% 1.0% RESPIRATORY SYSTEM Dyspnea 2.6%* 0.3% Respiratory Disorder 1.1% 0.7% SPECIAL SENSES page 8 of 12 Vision Abnormal 1.4% 0.7% UROGENITAL SYSTEM Impotence 1.1% 1.0% Urinary Tract Infection 1.4% 2.3% SKIN & APPENDAGES Sweating Increased 1.1% 1.0% PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS Anxiety 1.1% 0.3% Insomnia 1.2% 0.3% *p 243 0.05 for treatment differences206Includes vertigoIn these placebo-controlled studies of 665 doxazosin patients, treated for a mean of 85 days, additional adverse reactions have beenreported. These are less than 1% and not distinguishable from those that occurred in the placebo group. Adverse reactions with anincidence of less than 1% but of clinical interest are (doxazosin vs. placebo): Cardiovascular System: angina pectoris (0.6% vs. 0.7%),postural hypotension (0.3% vs. 0.3%), syncope (0.5% vs. 0.0%), tachycardia (0.9% vs. 0.0%); Urogenital System: dysuria (0.5% vs.1.3%), and Psychiatric Disorders: libido decreased (0.8% vs. 0.3%). The safety profile in patients treated for up to three years wassimilar to that in the placebo-controlled studies.The majority of adverse experiences with doxazosin were mild.HypertensionDoxazosin mesylate has been administered to approximately 4,000 hypertensive patients, of whom 1,679 were included in thehypertension clinical development program. In that program, minor adverse effects were frequent, but led to discontinuation oftreatment in only 7% of patients. In placebo-controlled studies adverse effects occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosinand placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. The major reasons for discontinuationwere postural effects (2%), edema, malaise/fatigue, and some heart rate disturbance, each about 0.7%.In controlled hypertension clinical trials directly comparing doxazosin to placebo there was no significant difference in the incidenceof side effects, except for dizziness (including postural), weight gain, somnolence and fatigue/malaise. Postural effects and edemaappeared to be dose related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studiesinvolving once daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1 to 16 mg. Table 4 summarizes those adverse experiences(possibly/probably related) reported for patients in these hypertension studies where the prevalence rate in the doxazosin group was atleast 0.5% or where the reaction is of particular interest.TABLE 4 ADVERSE REACTIONS DURING PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDIES HYPERTENSION DOXAZOSIN(N=339) PLACEBO(N=336) CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Dizziness 19% 9% Vertigo 2% 1% Postural Hypotension 0.3% 0% Edema 4% 3% Palpitation 2% 3% Arrhythmia 1% 0% Hypotension 1% 0% Tachycardia 0.3% 1% Peripheral Ischemia 0.3% 0% SKIN & APPENDAGES Rash 1% 1% Pruritus 1% 1% MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM Arthralgia/Arthritis 1% 0% Muscle Weakness 1% 0% Myalgia 1% 0% CENTRAL & PERIPHERAL N.S. page 9 of 12 Headache 14% 16% Paresthesia 1% 1% Kinetic Disorders 1% 0% Ataxia 1% 0% Hypertonia 1% 0% Muscle Cramps 1% 0% AUTONOMIC Mouth Dry 2% 2% Flushing 1% 0% SPECIAL SENSES Vision Abnormal 2% 1% Conjunctivitis/Eye Pain 1% 1% Tinnitus 1% 0.3% PSYCHIATRIC Somnolence 5% 1% Nervousness 2% 2% Depression 1% 1% Insomnia 1% 1% Sexual Dysfunction 2% 1% GASTROINTESTINAL Nausea 3% 4% Diarrhea 2% 3% Constipation 1% 1% Dyspepsia 1% 1% Flatulence 1% 1% Abdominal Pain 0% 2% Vomiting 0% 1% RESPIRATORY Rhinitis 3% 1% Dyspnea 1% 1% Epistaxis 1% 0% URINARY Polyuria 2% 0% Urinary Incontinence 1% 0% Micturition Frequency 0% 2% GENERAL Fatigue/Malaise 12% 6% Chest Pain 2% 2% Asthenia 1% 1% Face Edema 1% 0% Pain 2% 2% Additional adverse reactions have been reported, but these are, in general, not distinguishable from symptoms that might haveoccurred in the absence of exposure to doxazosin.
