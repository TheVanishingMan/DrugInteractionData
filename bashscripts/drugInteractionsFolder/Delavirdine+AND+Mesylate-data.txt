        "Drug Interactions (See also CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions.) Delavirdine is an inhibitor of CYP3A isoform and other CYP isoforms to a lesser extent including CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19. Coadministration of RESCRIPTOR and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and sildenafil) may result in increased plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug that could increase or prolong both its therapeutic or adverse effects. Delavirdine is metabolized primarily by CYP3A, but in vitro data suggest that delavirdine may also be metabolized by CYP2D6. Coadministration of RESCRIPTOR and drugs that induce CYP3A, such as rifampin, may decrease delavirdine plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. Coadministration of RESCRIPTOR and drugs that inhibit CYP3A may increase delavirdine plasma concentrations. (See Table 6, Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With RESCRIPTOR, and Table 7, Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction.) Table 6. Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With RESCRIPTOR Drug Class: Drug Name Clinical Comment Anticonvulsant agents: Phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine May lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to RESCRIPTOR or to the class of NNRTIs. Antihistamines: Astemizole, terfenadine CONTRAINDICATED due to potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Antimycobacterials: Rifabutin,a rifampin a May lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to RESCRIPTOR or to the class of NNRTIs or other coadministered antiviral agents. Ergot Derivatives: Dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine CONTRAINDICATED due to potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues. GI motility agent: Cisapride CONTRAINDICATED due to potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Herbal Products: St. John's wort ( hypericum perforatum) May lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to RESCRIPTOR or to the class of NNRTIs. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: Lovastatin, simvastatin Potential for serious reactions such as risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. Neuroleptic: Pimozide CONTRAINDICATED due to potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Sedative/hypnotics: Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam CONTRAINDICATED due to potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression. aSee CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for magnitude of interaction, Tables 1 and 2.

Didanosinea |Delavirdine|Didanosine Administration of didanosine (buffered tablets) and RESCRIPTOR should be separated by at least 1 hour. Indinavira |Indinavir A dose reduction of indinavir to 600 mg 3 times daily should be considered when RESCRIPTOR and indinavir are coadministered. Lopinavir/Ritonavir |Lopinavir|Ritonavir Appropriate doses of this combination with respect to safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics have not been established. Nelfinavira |Nelfinavir|Delavirdine Appropriate doses of this combination with respect to safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics have not been established.

Saquinavira |Saquinavir A dose reduction of saquinavir (soft gelatin capsules) may be considered when RESCRIPTOR and saquinavir are coadministered (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Table 1). Appropriate doses with respect to safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics have not been established. Other Agents Acid blockers: Antacidsa |Delavirdine Doses of an antacid and RESCRIPTOR should be separated by at least 1 hour, because the absorption of delavirdine is reduced when coadministered with antacids. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists: Cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine |Delavirdine These agents increase gastric pH and may reduce the absorption of delavirdine. Although the effect of these drugs on delavirdine absorption has not been evaluated, chronic use of these drugs with RESCRIPTOR is not recommended. Proton pump inhibitors: Omeprazole, lansoprazole |Delavirdine These agents increase gastric pH and may reduce the absorption of delavirdine. Although the effect of these drugs on delavirdine absorption has not been evaluated, chronic use of these drugs with RESCRIPTOR is not recommended. Amphetamines |Amphetamines Use with caution. Antidepressant: Trazodone |Trazodone Concomitant use of trazodone and RESCRIPTOR may increase plasma concentrations of trazodone. Adverse events of nausea, dizziness, hypotension, and syncope have been observed following coadministration of trazodone and ritonavir. If trazodone is used with a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as RESCRIPTOR, the combination should be used with caution and a lower dose of trazadone should be considered. Antiarrhythmics: Bepridil |Antiarrhythmics Use with caution. Increased bepridil exposure may be associated with life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Amiodarone,lidocaine (systemic), quinidine, flecainide, propafenone Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended, if available, for antiarrhythmics when coadministered with RESCRIPTOR. Anticoagulant: Warfarin |Warfarin It is recommended that INR (international normalized ratio) be monitored. Anti-infective: Clarithromycina |Clarithromycin When coadministered with RESCRIPTOR, clarithromycin should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function: For patients with CLCR 30 to 60 mL/min the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%. For patients with CLCR <30 mL/min the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 75%. Calcium channel blockers: Amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil |Calcium channel blockers Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. Corticosteroid: Dexamethasone |Delavirdine Use with caution. RESCRIPTOR may be less effective due to decreased delavirdine plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly. Erectile dysfunction agents: Sildenafil |Sildenafil Sildenafil should not exceed a maximum single dose of 25 mg in a 48-hour period. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: Atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin |Atorvastatin |Cerivastatin|Fluvastatin Use lowest possible dose of atorvastatin or cerivastatin, or fluvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as pravastatin in combination with RESCRIPTOR.
