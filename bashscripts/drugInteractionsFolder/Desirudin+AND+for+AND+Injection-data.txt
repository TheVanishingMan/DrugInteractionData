        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use with other drugs that inhibit or modify platelet function or affect blood clotting (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, NSAIDs, SSRIs) as coadministration may potentiate bleeding (7). 7.1 Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk Discontinue any agent which may enhance the risk of hemorrhage prior to initiation of Iprivask therapy. These agents include medications such as Dextran 40, systemic glucocorticoids, thrombolytics, and anticoagulants. If co-administration cannot be avoided, close clinical and laboratory monitoring should be conducted. During prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, concomitant treatment with heparins (unfractionated and low-molecular weight heparins) or dextrans is not recommended. The effects of desirudin and unfractionated heparins on prolongation of aPTT are additive. As with other anticoagulants, desirudin should be used with caution in conjunction with drugs which affect platelet function. These medications include systemic salicylates, NSAIDS including ketorolac, acetylsalicylic acid, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, sulfinpyrazone, clopidogrel, abciximab and other glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 7.2 Coadministration with Warfarin The concomitant administration of warfarin did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic effects of desirudin. When warfarin and desirudin were coadministered, greater inhibition of hemostasis measured by activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and international normalized ratio (INR) was observed [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] ."

In the Phase II and III clinical studies, desirudin was administered to 2159 patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery to determine the safety and efficacy of Iprivask in preventing VTE in this population. Below is the safety profile of the Iprivask 15 mg (q12h) regimen. Hemorrhagic Events [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] : The following rates of hemorrhagic events have been reported during clinical trials.

Non-hemorrhagic Events: Non-hemorrhagic adverse events occurring at ≥2% incidence in patients treated with Iprivask 15 mg (q 12h) during elective hip replacement surgery and considered to be remotely, possibly, or probably related to desirudin are provided below.

These events were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size and the frequency of occurrence cannot be determined precisely: reports of major hemorrhages [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], some of which were fatal, and anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage: Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with Iprivask. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. Avoid intramuscular injection as local bleeding and hematoma formation may result. (5.2). Increased Risk of bleeding with Renal Impairment: Dose reductions by factors of three and nine are recommended for patients with moderate and severe renal impairment respectively (2.2). In addition, daily aPTT and serum creatinine monitoring are recommended for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment(5.3). 5.1 Spinal/Epidural Hematoma There is a risk of neuraxial hematoma formation with the concurrent use of desirudin and spinal/epidural anesthesia, which has the potential to result in long term or permanent paralysis. The risk may be greater with the use of post-operative indwelling catheters or the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs), platelet inhibitors or other anticoagulants [ see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated neuraxial puncture. To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of desirudin and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia, the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug should be considered [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] when scheduling or using epidural or spinal anesthesia in proximity to desirudin administration. The physician should consider placement of the catheter prior to initiating desirudin and removal of the catheter when the anticoagulant effect of desirudin is low [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural/spinal anesthesia, extreme vigilance and frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and symptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Patients should be instructed to inform their physician immediately if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, urgent diagnosis and treatment including spinal cord decompression should be initiated. The physician should consider the potential benefit versus risk before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. Iprivask cannot be used interchangeably with other hirudins as they differ in manufacturing process and specific biological activity (ATUs). Each of these medicines has its own instructions for use. 5.2 Hemorrhagic Events Avoid intramuscular injection of Iprivask as bleeding and local hematoma formation can occur. Iprivask increases the risks of hemorrhage in patients with recent major surgery, organ biopsy or puncture of a non-compressible vessel within the last month; a history of hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial or intraocular bleeding including diabetic (hemorrhagic) retinopathy; recent ischemic stroke, severe uncontrolled hypertension, bacterial endocarditis, a known hemostatic disorder (congenital or acquired, e.g. hemophilia, liver disease) or a history of gastrointestinal or pulmonary bleeding within the past 3 months. Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with Iprivask. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site. In post marketing experience reports of fatal and serious bleeding events have occurred in patients treated with Iprivask. Sources of hemorrhage included bleeding from the brain, gastrointestinal tract, spleen, rectum, and vagina [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Avoid use with other drugs that inhibit or modify platelet function or affect blood clotting (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, NSAIDs, SSRIs) as coadministration with Iprivask may potentiate bleeding. If these concomitant medications cannot be avoided, patients should be monitored for bleeding [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Increased Risk of Bleeding with Renal Impairment Iprivask must be used with caution in patients with renal impairment due to an increased risk for bleeding, particularly in those with moderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce dose and monitor daily aPTT and serum creatinine in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.4 Antibodies/Re-exposure Antibodies have been reported in patients treated with hirudins. Potential for cross-sensitivity to hirudin products cannot be excluded. Irritative skin reactions were observed in 9/322 volunteers exposed to Iprivask by subcutaneous injection or intravenous bolus or infusion in single or multiple administrations of the drug. The allergic reaction in volunteers consisted of arthralgia, erythema, pruritus, or uticaria. Allergic events were reported in <2% of patients who were administered desirudin in Phase III clinical trials. Allergic events were reported in 1% of patients receiving unfractionated heparin and 1% of patients receiving enoxaparin. Hirudin-specific IgE evaluations may not be indicative of sensitivity to Iprivask as this test was not always positive in the presence of symptoms. Anti-hirudin antibodies have been detected upon re-exposure to desirudin [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported during hirudin therapy."
