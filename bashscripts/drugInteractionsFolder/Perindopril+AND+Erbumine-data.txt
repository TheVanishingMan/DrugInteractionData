        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Diuretics: Excessive drop in blood pressure (7.1) Potassium-sparing diuretics/potassium supplements: Hyperkalemia (7.2) Lithium: Increase serum lithium levels, symptoms of lithium toxicity (7.3) Injectable gold: Nitritoid reactions (facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) (7.4) NSAID use may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect (7.7) Dual inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia (7.8). 7.1 Diuretics Patients on diuretics, and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of ACEON therapy. The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either decreasing the dose of or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril. If diuretic therapy cannot be altered, provide close medical supervision with the first dose of ACEON, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics. The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition. 7.2 Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics ACEON may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patient's serum potassium frequently. 7.3 Lithium Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. Frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended. Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity. 7.4 Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including ACEON. 7.5 Digoxin A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when coadministered with ACEON, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded. 7.6 Gentamicin Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin. However, this has not been investigated in human studies. 7.7 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving perindopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.8 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on ACEON and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with ACEON in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with ACEON in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypertension: Most common adverse events (incidence greater than or equal to 5%) are cough, dizziness and back pain (6.1) Stable Coronary Artery Disease: Most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were cough, drug intolerance, and hypotension (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Symplmed, LLC. at 1-888-985-7657 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.FDA.gov/Medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia and agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Impaired renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Cough [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Hypertension ACEON has been evaluated for safety in approximately 3,400 patients with hypertension in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. The data presented here are based on results from the 1,417 ACEON-treated patients who participated in the U.S. clinical trials. Over 220 of these patients were treated with ACEONÂ® (perindopril erbumine) for at least one year. In placebo-controlled U.S. clinical trials, the incidence of premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was 6.5% in patients treated with ACEON and 6.7% in patients treated with placebo. The most common causes were cough, headache, asthenia and dizziness. Among 1,012 patients in placebo-controlled U.S. trials, the overall frequency of reported adverse events was similar in patients treated with ACEON and in those treated with placebo (approximately 75% in each group). The only adverse events whose incidence on ACEON was at least 2% greater than on placebo were cough (12% vs. 4.5%) and back pain (5.8% vs. 3.1%). Dizziness was not reported more frequently in the perindopril group (8.2%) than in the placebo group (8.5%), but its likelihood increased with dose, suggesting a causal relationship with perindopril. Stable Coronary Artery Disease Perindopril has been evaluated for safety in EUROPA, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 12,218 patients with stable coronary artery disease. The overall rate of discontinuation was about 22% on drug and placebo. The most common medical reasons for discontinuation that were more frequent on perindopril than placebo were cough, drug intolerance and hypotension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Voluntary reports of adverse events in patients taking ACEON that have been received since market introduction and are of unknown causal relationship to ACEON include: cardiac arrest, eosinophilic pneumonitis, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, nephritis, hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic), symptomatic hyponatremia, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, acute pancreatitis, falls, psoriasis, exfoliative dermatitis and a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), leukocytosis, eosinophilia or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). 6.3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Hematology: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit occur frequently in hypertensive patients treated with ACEON, but are rarely of clinical importance. In controlled clinical trials, no patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Leukopenia (including neutropenia) was observed in 0.1% of patients in U.S. clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Liver Function Tests: Elevations in ALT (1.6% ACEON versus 0.9% placebo) and AST (0.5% ACEON versus 0.4% placebo) have been observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials. The elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Watch for anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema (5.1) Monitor renal function during therapy (5.8) Assess for hypotension and hyperkalemia (5.2, 5.6) 5.1 Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including ACEON) may be subject to a variety of adverse events, some of them serious. Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to nonblacks. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including ACEON (0.1% of patients treated with ACEON in U.S. clinical trials). Angioedema associated with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx may be fatal. In such cases, discontinue ACEON treatment immediately and observe until the swelling disappears. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, administer appropriate therapy, such as subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL), promptly. Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. 5.2 Hypotension ACEON can cause symptomatic hypotension. ACEON has been associated with hypotension in 0.3% of uncomplicated hypertensive patients in U.S. placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms related to orthostatic hypotension were reported in another 0.8% of patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea or vomiting [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. ACE inhibitors may cause excessive hypotension, and may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and death. In patients with ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease, an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or a cerebrovascular accident. In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, ACEON therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. Patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of ACEON and/or diuretic is increased. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed immediately in a supine position and, if necessary, treated with an intravenous infusion of physiological saline. ACEON treatment can usually be continued following restoration of volume and blood pressure. 5.3 Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ACE inhibitors have been associated with agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, most frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially patients with a collagen vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected discontinue ACEON as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.5 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. Renal function should be monitored periodically in patients receiving ACEON [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)], [see Drug Interactions (7)]. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, where renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with ACE inhibitors, including ACEON, may be associated with oliguria, progressive azotemia, and, rarely, acute renal failure and death. In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur; usually reversible upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some ACEON-treated patients have developed minor and transient increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine especially in those concomitantly treated with a diuretic. 5.6 Hyperkalemia Elevations of serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including ACEON. Most cases were isolated single values that did not appear clinically relevant and were rarely a cause for withdrawal. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and the concomitant use of agents such as potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically in patients receiving ACEON. 5.7 Cough Presumably because of the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough. 5.8 Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. 5.9 Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, ACEON may block angiotensin II formation that would otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension attributable to this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion."

The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.8 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on ACEON and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with ACEON in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with ACEON in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypertension: Most common adverse events (incidence greater than or equal to 5%) are cough, dizziness and back pain (6.1) Stable Coronary Artery Disease: Most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were cough, drug intolerance, and hypotension (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact XOMA (US) LLC at 1-800-718-9884 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.FDA.gov/Medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Neutropenia and agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Impaired renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Cough [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Hypertension ACEON has been evaluated for safety in approximately 3,400 patients with hypertension in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. The data presented here are based on results from the 1,417 ACEON-treated patients who participated in the U.S. clinical trials. Over 220 of these patients were treated with ACEONÂ® (perindopril erbumine) for at least one year. In placebo-controlled U.S. clinical trials, the incidence of premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was 6.5% in patients treated with ACEON and 6.7% in patients treated with placebo. The most common causes were cough, headache, asthenia and dizziness. Among 1,012 patients in placebo-controlled U.S. trials, the overall frequency of reported adverse events was similar in patients treated with ACEON and in those treated with placebo (approximately 75% in each group). The only adverse events whose incidence on ACEON was at least 2% greater than on placebo were cough (12% vs. 4.5%) and back pain (5.8% vs. 3.1%). Dizziness was not reported more frequently in the perindopril group (8.2%) than in the placebo group (8.5%), but its likelihood increased with dose, suggesting a causal relationship with perindopril. Stable Coronary Artery Disease Perindopril has been evaluated for safety in EUROPA, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 12,218 patients with stable coronary artery disease. The overall rate of discontinuation was about 22% on drug and placebo. The most common medical reasons for discontinuation that were more frequent on perindopril than placebo were cough, drug intolerance and hypotension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Voluntary reports of adverse events in patients taking ACEON that have been received since market introduction and are of unknown causal relationship to ACEON include: cardiac arrest, eosinophilic pneumonitis, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, nephritis, hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic), symptomatic hyponatremia, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, acute pancreatitis, falls, psoriasis, exfoliative dermatitis and a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), leukocytosis, eosinophilia or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). 6.3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Hematology: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit occur frequently in hypertensive patients treated with ACEON, but are rarely of clinical importance. In controlled clinical trials, no patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Leukopenia (including neutropenia) was observed in 0.1% of patients in U.S. clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Liver Function Tests: Elevations in ALT (1.6% ACEON versus 0.9% placebo) and AST (0.5% ACEON versus 0.4% placebo) have been observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials. The elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Watch for anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema (5.1) Monitor renal function during therapy (5.8) Assess for hypotension and hyperkalemia (5.2, 5.6) 5.1 Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including ACEON) may be subject to a variety of adverse events, some of them serious. Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to nonblacks. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including ACEON (0.1% of patients treated with ACEON in U.S. clinical trials). Angioedema associated with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx may be fatal. In such cases, discontinue ACEON treatment immediately and observe until the swelling disappears. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, administer appropriate therapy, such as subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL), promptly. Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. 5.2 Hypotension ACEON can cause symptomatic hypotension. ACEON has been associated with hypotension in 0.3% of uncomplicated hypertensive patients in U.S. placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms related to orthostatic hypotension were reported in another 0.8% of patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea or vomiting [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. ACE inhibitors may cause excessive hypotension, and may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and death. In patients with ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease, an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or a cerebrovascular accident. In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, ACEON therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. Patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of ACEON and/or diuretic is increased. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed immediately in a supine position and, if necessary, treated with an intravenous infusion of physiological saline. ACEON treatment can usually be continued following restoration of volume and blood pressure. 5.3 Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ACE inhibitors have been associated with agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, most frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially patients with a collagen vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected discontinue ACEON as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.5 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. Renal function should be monitored periodically in patients receiving ACEON [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)], [see Drug Interactions (7.8)]. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, where renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with ACE inhibitors, including ACEON, may be associated with oliguria, progressive azotemia, and, rarely, acute renal failure and death. In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur; usually reversible upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some ACEON-treated patients have developed minor and transient increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine especially in those concomitantly treated with a diuretic. 5.6 Hyperkalemia Elevations of serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including ACEON. Most cases were isolated single values that did not appear clinically relevant and were rarely a cause for withdrawal. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and the concomitant use of agents such as potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically in patients receiving ACEON. 5.7 Cough Presumably because of the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough. 5.8 Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. 5.9 Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, ACEON may block angiotensin II formation that would otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension attributable to this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: risk of hyperkalemia (7). Lithium: increased serum lithium levels; toxicity symptoms (7). Injectable gold: flushing, nausea, vomiting, or hypotension (7). Dual inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia (7). Do not exceed doses greater than 20 mg daily of simvastatin (7). NSAIDs: risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect (7). Diuretics: increased risk of hypotension, consider dose reduction (7). CYP3A inhibitors: risk of hypotension and edema (7). Prestalia The pharmacokinetics of perindopril and amlodipine are not altered when the drugs are co-administered. No drug interaction studies have been conducted with PRESTALIA, although studies have been conducted with perindopril and amlodipine. mTOR Inhibitors: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Perindopril Diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with PRESTALIA. Provide close medical supervision with the first dose of PRESTALIA, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour. Perindopril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements, or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. When co-administering PRESTALIA and lithium, frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (NSAIDS) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving perindopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on PRESTALIA and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with PRESTALIA in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with PRESTALIA in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Amlodipine Simvastatin: Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin administered alone. Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on amlodipine to 20 mg daily. Cyclosporine: A prospective study in renal transplant patients showed an average 40% increase in trough cyclosporin levels during concomitant treatment with amlodipine. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine is recommended. CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration of the moderate CYP3A inhibitor diltiazem increases the exposure to amlodipine by 60%. Co-administered erythromycin, also a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, does not impact the exposure to amlodipine. Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole) may increase the plasma concentrations of the CYP3A substrate amlodipine to a greater extent. Monitor for symptoms of hypotension and edema when amlodipine is co-administered with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors to determine the need for dose adjustment. CYP3A Inducers: No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be monitored when amlodipine is co-administered with CYP3A inducers."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions were edema (7.2%), cough (3.2%), headache (2.5%), and dizziness (2.5%) (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact SYMPLMED LLC at 1-888-552-9769 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In an active-controlled 6-week trial, the safety of the maximum dose of PRESTALIA (14/10 mg) was evaluated in 279 patients with hypertension and compared with perindopril erbumine 16 mg and amlodipine 10 mg. Adverse reactions were generally mild and transient in nature. Discontinuations because of adverse events occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with PRESTALIA 14/10 mg compared to 4.3% of patients treated with perindopril erbumine 16 mg and 4.6% of patients treated with amlodipine 10 mg. The most common reason for discontinuation of therapy with PRESTALIA was peripheral edema (1.8%). Common adverse events that occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with PRESTALIA in the 6-week trial are presented in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of â¥2% in PRESTALIA-Treated Patients PERe = perindopril erbumine; AML = amlodipine besylate Adverse Event PRESTALIA 14/10 mg (N = 279) n (%) PERe 16 mg (N = 278) n (%) AML 10 mg (N = 280) n (%) Edema peripheral 20 (7.2) 1 (0.4) 37 (13.2) Cough 9 (3.2) 8 (2.9) 2 (0.7) Headache 7 (2.5) 8 (2.9) 8 (2.9) Dizziness 7 (2.5) 4 (1.4) 3 (1.1) The overall frequency of adverse reactions was similar between men and women, and black and non-black patients. In black patients, the incidence of peripheral edema was similar in the PRESTALIA 14/10 mg and amlodipine 10 mg arms (3%). Other adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial with some plausible relationship to PRESTALIA are listed below. Dermatologic: Rash Digestive: Nausea, diarrhea The safety of the lowest dose of PRESTALIA (3.5/2.5 mg) was evaluated in 249 patients with hypertension and compared with placebo and perindopril and amlodipine administered as monotherapies in an 8-week trial. The only emergent adverse event observed in at least 2% of patients treated with PRESTALIA was hyperkalemia (2.4%). Peripheral edema was reported in 1.6% of patients receiving PRESTALIA 3.5/2.5 mg. Monotherapy with perindopril or amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in clinical trials in over 3,000 and 11,000 patients, respectively, as summarized below. Perindopril Perindopril erbumine has been evaluated for safety in approximately 3,400 patients with hypertension in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. The data presented here are based on results from the 1,417 perindopril-treated patients who participated in the U.S. clinical trials. Over 220 of these patients were treated with perindopril for at least one year. In placebo-controlled U.S. clinical trials, the incidence of premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was 6.5% in patients treated with perindopril erbumine and 6.7% in patients treated with placebo. The most common causes were cough, headache, asthenia, and dizziness. Among 1,012 patients in placebo-controlled U.S. trials, the overall frequency of reported adverse events was similar in patients treated with perindopril erbumine and in those treated with placebo (approximately 75% in each group). The only adverse events whose incidence on perindopril erbumine was at least 2% greater than on placebo were cough (12% vs. 4.5%) and back pain (5.8% vs. 3.1%). Dizziness was not reported more frequently in the perindopril group (8.2%) than in the placebo group (8.5%), but its likelihood increased with dose, suggesting a causal relationship with perindopril. Amlodipine Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In controlled clinical trials comparing amlodipine (N=1730) in doses up to 10 mg with placebo (N=1250), discontinuation of amlodipine due to adverse reactions was required in about 1.5% of amlodipine-treated patients and about 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most common side effects were edema, dizziness, flushing, and palpitations. The following events occurred in <1% but >0.1% of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain; they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship: Cardiovascular: arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, vasculitis. Central and Peripheral Nervous System: hypoesthesia, neuropathy peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia. General: allergic reaction, asthenia,1 back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease. Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps,1 myalgia. Psychiatric: sexual dysfunction (male1 and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization. Respiratory System: dyspnea,1 epistaxis. Skin and Appendages: angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus,1 rash,1 rash erythematous, rash maculopapular. Special Senses: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus. Urinary System: micturition frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia. Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth, sweating increased. Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, thirst. Hematopoietic: leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. 1 These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies. Clinical Laboratory Findings Perindopril Hematology: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit occur frequently in hypertensive patients treated with perindopril, but are rarely of clinical importance. In controlled clinical trials, no patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Leukopenia (including neutropenia) was observed in 0.1% of patients in U.S. clinical trials. Liver Function Tests: Elevations in alanine transaminase (ALT; 1.6% perindopril erbumine vs. 0.9% placebo) and aspartate transaminase (AST; 0.5% perindopril erbumine vs. 0.4% placebo) have been observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials. The elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the individual components of PRESTALIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Perindopril: Voluntary reports of adverse events in patients taking perindopril that have been received since market introduction and are of unknown causal relationship to perindopril include: cardiac arrest, eosinophilic pneumonitis, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, nephritis, hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic), symptomatic hyponatremia, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, acute pancreatitis, falls, psoriasis, exfoliative dermatitis, and a syndrome that may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Amlodipine: The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: palpitations, gynecomastia, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), some requiring hospitalization."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema (head, neck, or intestinal) (5.2). Myocardial infarction: Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of PRESTALIA, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease (5.3). Assess for hypotension and hyperkalemia (5.4, 5.5). Monitor renal function during therapy (5.7). 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue PRESTALIA as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin. Patients taking ACE inhibitors (including the one in PRESTALIA) may, therefore, be subject to a variety of bradykinin- or prostaglandin-mediated adverse reactions, some of them serious. Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of angioedema compared with non-blacks. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors (0.1% of patients treated with perindopril in U.S. clinical trials). Angioedema associated with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx may be fatal. In such cases, discontinue perindopril treatment immediately and observe until the swelling disappears. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, administer appropriate therapy, such as subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL), promptly. Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. [see Drug Interaction (7)] Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting), and the angioedema was diagnosed by imaging studies such as abdominal CT or ultrasound, or at surgery. In some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema, and C-1 esterase levels were normal. Symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. 5.3 Increased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of PRESTALIA, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. 5.4 Hypotension PRESTALIA can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, start PRESTALIA therapy under close medical supervision. Follow patients closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of PRESTALIA is increased or a diuretic is added or its dose increased. If excessive hypotension occurs, immediately place patient in a supine position and, if necessary, treat patient with an intravenous infusion of physiological saline. PRESTALIA treatment can usually be continued following restoration of volume and blood pressure. Patients with severe aortic stenosis may be more likely to experience symptomatic hypotension. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely. Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, PRESTALIA may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion. 5.5 Hyperkalemia Elevations of serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including PRESTALIA. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of agents such as potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving PRESTALIA. 5.6 Cough Presumably because of the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough. 5.7 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with PRESTALIA. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe congestive heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on PRESTALIA. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on PRESTALIA."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS â¢Diuretics: Excessive drop in blood pressure. (7.1) â¢Potassium-sparing diuretics/potassium supplements: Hyperkalemia. (7.2) â¢Lithium: Increase serum lithium levels, symptoms of lithium toxicity. (7.3) â¢Injectable gold: Nitritoid reactions (facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension). (7.4) â¢NSAID use may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. (7.7) â¢Dual inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension and hyperkalemia. (7.8) 7.1 Diuretics Patients on diuretics, and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of perindopril therapy. The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either decreasing the dose of or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril. If diuretic therapy cannot be altered, provide close medical supervision with the first dose of perindopril, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics. The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition. 7.2 Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics Perindopril may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patientâs serum potassium frequently. 7.3 Lithium Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. Frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended. Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity. 7.4 Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including perindopril. 7.5 Digoxin A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when co-administered with perindopril erbumine, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded. 7.6 Gentamicin Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin. However, this has not been investigated in human studies. 7.7 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving perindopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.8 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on ACEON and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with perindopril tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with perindopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. â¢ Hypertension: Most common adverse events (incidence greater than or equal to 5%) are cough, dizziness and back pain. (6.1) â¢ Stable Coronary Artery Disease: Most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were cough, drug intolerance, and hypotension. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Roxane Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-962-8364 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/Medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling: â¢Anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] â¢Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] â¢Neutropenia and agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] â¢Impaired renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] â¢Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] â¢Cough [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hypertension Perindopril has been evaluated for safety in approximately 3,400 patients with hypertension in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. The data presented here are based on results from the 1,417 perindopril-treated patients who participated in the U.S. clinical trials. Over 220 of these patients were treated with perindopril for at least one year. In placebo-controlled U.S. clinical trials, the incidence of premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was 6.5% in patients treated with perindopril and 6.7% in patients treated with placebo. The most common causes were cough, headache, asthenia and dizziness. Among 1,012 patients in placebo-controlled U.S. trials, the overall frequency of reported adverse events was similar in patients treated with perindopril and in those treated with placebo (approximately 75% in each group). The only adverse events whose incidence on perindopril was at least 2% greater than on placebo were cough (12% vs. 4.5%) and back pain (5.8% vs. 3.1%). Dizziness was not reported more frequently in the perindopril group (8.2%) than in the placebo group (8.5%), but its likelihood increased with dose, suggesting a causal relationship with perindopril. Stable Coronary Artery Disease Perindopril has been evaluated for safety in EUROPA, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 12,218 patients with stable coronary artery disease. The overall rate of discontinuation was about 22% on drug and placebo. The most common medical reasons for discontinuation that were more frequent on perindopril than placebo were cough, drug intolerance and hypotension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Voluntary reports of adverse events in patients taking perindopril that have been received since market introduction and are of unknown causal relationship to perindopril include: cardiac arrest, eosinophilic pneumonitis, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, nephritis, hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic), symptomatic hyponatremia, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, acute pancreatitis, falls, psoriasis, exfoliative dermatitis and a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), leukocytosis, eosinophilia or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). 6.3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Hematology Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit occur frequently in hypertensive patients treated with perindopril, but are rarely of clinical importance. In controlled clinical trials, no patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Leukopenia (including neutropenia) was observed in 0.1% of patients in U.S. clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Liver Function Tests Elevations in ALT (1.6% perindopril versus 0.9% placebo) and AST (0.5% perindopril versus 0.4% placebo) have been observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials. The elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS â¢Watch for anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema. (5.1) â¢Monitor renal function during therapy. (5.8) â¢Assess for hypotension and hyperkalemia. (5.2, 5.6) 5.1 Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including perindopril) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to nonblacks. Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril (0.1% of patients treated with perindopril in U.S. clinical trials). Angioedema associated with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx may be fatal. In such cases, discontinue perindopril treatment immediately and observe until the swelling disappears. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, administer appropriate therapy, such as subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL), promptly. Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. 5.2 Hypotension Perindopril can cause symptomatic hypotension. Perindopril has been associated with hypotension in 0.3% of uncomplicated hypertensive patients in U.S. placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms related to orthostatic hypotension were reported in another 0.8% of patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea or vomiting [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. ACE inhibitors may cause excessive hypotension, and may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and death. In patients with ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease, an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or a cerebrovascular accident. In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, perindopril therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. Patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of perindopril and/or diuretic is increased. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed immediately in a supine position and, if necessary, treated with an intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Perindopril treatment can usually be continued following restoration of volume and blood pressure. 5.3 Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ACE inhibitors have been associated with agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, most frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially patients with a collagen vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected discontinue perindopril as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.5 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. Renal function should be monitored periodically in patients receiving perindopril [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7) ]. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, where renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may be associated with oliguria, progressive azotemia, and, rarely, acute renal failure and death. In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur; usually reversible upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor . In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some perindopril-treated patients have developed minor and transient increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine especially in those concomitantly treated with a diuretic. 5.6 Hyperkalemia Elevations of serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril. Most cases were isolated single values that did not appear clinically relevant and were rarely a cause for withdrawal. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and the concomitant use of agents such as potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically in patients receiving perindopril. 5.7 Cough Presumably because of the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough. 5.8 Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. 5.9 Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, perindopril may block angiotensin II formation that would otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension attributable to this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Diuretics: Excessive drop in blood pressure (7.1) Potassium-sparing diuretics/potassium supplements: Hyperkalemia (7.2) Lithium: Increase serum lithium levels, symptoms of lithium toxicity (7.3) Injectable gold: Nitritoid reactions (facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) (7.4) NSAID use may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect (7.7) Dual inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia (7.8). 7.1 Diuretics Patients on diuretics, and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of Perindopril Erbumine therapy. The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either decreasing the dose of or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril. If diuretic therapy cannot be altered, provide close medical supervision with the first dose of Perindopril Erbumine, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics. The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition. 7.2 Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics Perindopril Erbumine may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patientâs serum potassium frequently. 7.3 Lithium Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. Frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended. Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity. 7.4 Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including Perindopril Erbumine. 7.5 Digoxin A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when coadministered with Perindopril Erbumine, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded. 7.6 Gentamicin Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin.

Co-administration of both drugs should proceed with caution. Food Interaction: Oral administration of perindopril erbumine tablets with food does not significantly lower the rate or extent of perindopril absorption relative to the fasted state. However, the extent of biotransformation of perindopril to the active metabolite, perindoprilat, is reduced approximately 43%, resulting in a reduction in the plasma ACE inhibition curve of approximately 20%, probably clinically insignificant. In clinical trials, perindopril was generally administered in a non-fasting state."

Frequency of Adverse Events (%) All Adverse Events Possibly â or Probably â Related Adverse Events Perindopril n=789 Placebo n=223 Perindopril n=789 Placebo n=223 Cough 12.0 4.5 6.0 1.8 Back Pain 5.8 3.1 0.0 0.0 Sinusitis 5.2 3.6 0.6 0.0 Viral Infection 3.4 1.6 0.3 0.0 Upper Extremity Pain 2.8 1.4 0.2 0.0 Hypertonia 2.7 1.4 0.2 0.0 Dyspepsia 1.9 0.9 0.3 0.0 Fever 1.5 0.5 0.3 0.0 Proteinuria 1.5 0.5 1.0 0.5 Ear Infection 1.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 Palpitation 1.1 0.0 0.9 0.0 Of these, cough was the reason for withdrawal in 1.3% of perindopril and 0.4% of placebo patients. While dizziness was not reported more frequently in the perindopril group (8.2%) than in the placebo group (8.5%), it was clearly increased with dose, suggesting a causal relationship with perindopril. Other commonly reported complaints (1% or greater), regardless of causality, include: headache (23.8%), upper respiratory infection (8.6%), asthenia (7.9%), rhinitis (4.8%), low extremity pain (4.7%), diarrhea (4.3%), edema (3.9%), pharyngitis (3.3%), urinary tract infection (2.8%), abdominal pain (2.7%), sleep disorder (2.5%), chest pain (2.4%), injury, paresthesia, nausea, rash (each 2.3%), seasonal allergy, depression (each 2.0%), abnormal ECG (1.8%), ALT increase (1.7%), tinnitus, vomiting (each 1.5%), neck pain, male sexual dysfunction (each 1.4%), triglyceride increase, somnolence (each 1.3%), joint pain, nervousness, myalgia, menstrual disorder (each 1.1%), flatulence and arthritis (each 1.0%), but none of those was more frequent by at least 1% on perindopril than on placebo. Depending on the specific adverse event, approximately 30 to 70% of the common complaints were considered possibly or probably related to treatment. Stable Coronary Artery Disease Perindopril has been evaluated for safety in EUROPA, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 12,218 patients with stable coronary artery disease. The overall rate of discontinuation was about 22% on drug and placebo. The most common medical reasons for discontinuation that were more frequent on perindopril than placebo were cough, drug intolerance and hypotension. Below is a list (by body system) of adverse experiences reported in 0.3 to 1% of patients in U.S. placebo-controlled studies in hypertensive patients without regard to attribution to therapy. Less frequent but medically important adverse events are also included; the incidence of these events is given in parentheses. Body as a Whole: malaise, pain, cold/hot sensation, chills, fluid retention, orthostatic symptoms, anaphylactic reaction, facial edema, angioedema (0.1%). Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, dry mucous membrane, appetite increased, gastroenteritis. Respiratory: posterior nasal drip, bronchitis, rhinorrhea, throat disorder, dyspnea, sneezing, epistaxis, hoarseness, pulmonary fibrosis (<0.1%). Urogenital: vaginitis, kidney stone, flank pain, urinary frequency, urinary retention. Cardiovascular: hypotension, ventricular extrasystole, myocardial infarction, vasodilation, syncope, abnormal conduction, heart murmur, orthostatic hypotension. Endocrine: gout. Hematology: hematoma, ecchymosis. Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia. CNS: migraine, amnesia, vertigo, cerebral vascular accident (0.2%). Psychiatric: anxiety, psychosexual disorder. Dermatology: sweating, skin infection, tinea, pruritus, dry skin, erythema, fever blisters, purpura (0.1%). Special Senses: conjunctivitis, earache. Laboratory: potassium decrease, uric acid increase, alkaline phosphatase increase, cholesterol increase, AST increase, creatinine increase, hematuria, glucose increase. When perindopril erbumine tablets was given concomitantly with thiazide diuretics, adverse events were generally reported at the same rate as those for perindopril erbumine tablets alone, except for a higher incidence of abnormal laboratory findings known to be related to treatment with thiazide diuretics alone (e.g., increases in serum uric acid, triglycerides and cholesterol and decreases in serum potassium). Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors: Other medically important adverse effects reported with other available ACE inhibitors include: cardiac arrest, eosinophilic pneumonitis, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, nephritis, hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic), symptomatic hyponatremia, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, acute pancreatitis, falls, psoriasis, exfoliative dermatitis and a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia or an elevated ESR. Many of these adverse effects have also been reported for perindopril. Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality: See WARNINGS: Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Hypertension Hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters have been evaluated in U.S. placebo-controlled trials. In general, there were no clinically significant trends in laboratory test findings. Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials, 1.4% of the patients receiving perindopril erbumine tablets and 2.3% of the patients receiving placebo showed serum potassium levels greater than 5.7 mEq/L. (See PRECAUTIONS .) BUN/Serum Creatinine Elevations: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN and serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the proportion of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine were similar in the perindopril erbumine tablets and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of long-standing or markedly elevated blood pressure by any anti-hypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Hematology: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit occur frequently in hypertensive patients treated with perindopril erbumine tablets, but are rarely of clinical importance. In controlled clinical trials, no patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Leukopenia (including neutropenia) was observed in 0.1% of patients in U.S. clinical trials (See WARNINGS .) Liver Function Tests: Elevations in ALT (1.6% perindopril erbumine tablets vs 0.9% placebo) and AST (0.5% perindopril erbumine tablets vs 0.4% placebo) have been observed in U.S placebo-controlled clinical trials. The elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS â¢ Diuretics: Excessive drop in blood pressure (7.1) â¢ Potassium-sparing diuretics/potassium supplements: Hyperkalemia (7.2) â¢ Lithium: Increase serum lithium levels, symptoms of lithium toxicity (7.3) â¢ Injectable gold: Nitritoid reactions (facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) (7.4) â¢ NSAID use may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect (7.7) â¢ Dual inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia (7.8). 7.1 Diuretics Patients on diuretics, and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of Perindopril Erbumine therapy. The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either decreasing the dose of or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril. If diuretic therapy cannot be altered, provide close medical supervision with the first dose of Perindopril Erbumine, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics. The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition. 7.2 Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics Perindopril Erbumine may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patientâs serum potassium frequently. 7.3 Lithium Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. Frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended. Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity. 7.4 Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including Perindopril Erbumine. 7.5 Digoxin A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when coadministered with Perindopril Erbumine, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded. 7.6 Gentamicin Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin. However, this has not been investigated in human studies. 7.7 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving perindopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.8 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on Perindopril Erbumine and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with Perindopril Erbumine in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with Perindopril Erbumine in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. â¢ Hypertension: Most common adverse events (incidence greater than or equal to 5%) are cough, dizziness and back pain (6.1) â¢ Stable Coronary Artery Disease: Most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were cough, drug intolerance, and hypotension (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lannett Company, Inc. at 1-800-325-9994 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.FDA.gov/Medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling: â¢ Anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] â¢ Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] â¢ Neutropenia and agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] â¢ Impaired renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] â¢ Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] â¢ Cough [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypertension Perindopril Erbumine has been evaluated for safety in approximately 3,400 patients with hypertension in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. The data presented here are based on results from the 1,417 Perindopril Erbumine-treated patients who participated in the U.S. clinical trials. Over 220 of these patients were treated with Perindopril Erbumine for at least one year. In placebo-controlled U.S. clinical trials, the incidence of premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was 6.5% in patients treated with Perindopril Erbumine and 6.7% in patients treated with placebo. The most common causes were cough, headache, asthenia and dizziness. Among 1,012 patients in placebo-controlled U.S. trials, the overall frequency of reported adverse events was similar in patients treated with Perindopril Erbumine and in those treated with placebo (approximately 75% in each group). The only adverse events whose incidence on Perindopril Erbumine was at least 2% greater than on placebo were cough (12% vs. 4.5%) and back pain (5.8% vs. 3.1%). Dizziness was not reported more frequently in the perindopril group (8.2%) than in the placebo group (8.5%), but its likelihood increased with dose, suggesting a causal relationship with perindopril. Stable Coronary Artery Disease Perindopril has been evaluated for safety in EUROPA, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 12,218 patients with stable coronary artery disease. The overall rate of discontinuation was about 22% on drug and placebo. The most common medical reasons for discontinuation that were more frequent on perindopril than placebo were cough, drug intolerance and hypotension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Voluntary reports of adverse events in patients taking Perindopril Erbumine Tablets that have been received since market introduction and are of unknown causal relationship to Perindopril Erbumine Tablets include: cardiac arrest, eosinophilic pneumonitis, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, nephritis, hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic), symptomatic hyponatremia, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, acute pancreatitis, falls, psoriasis, exfoliative dermatitis and a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), leukocytosis, eosinophilia or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). 6.3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Hematology: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit occur frequently in hypertensive patients treated with Perindopril Erbumine, but are rarely of clinical importance. In controlled clinical trials, no patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Leukopenia (including neutropenia) was observed in 0.1% of patients in U.S. clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Liver Function Tests: Elevations in ALT (1.6% Perindopril Erbumine versus 0.9% placebo) and AST (0.5% Perindopril Erbumine versus 0.4% placebo) have been observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials. The elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS â¢ Watch for anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema (5.1) â¢ Monitor renal function during therapy (5.8) â¢ Assess for hypotension and hyperkalemia (5.2, 5.6) 5.1 Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including Perindopril Erbumine) may be subject to a variety of adverse events, some of them serious. Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to nonblacks. Head and Neck Angioedema : Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including Perindopril Erbumine (0.1% of patients treated with Perindopril Erbumine in U.S. clinical trials). Angioedema associated with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx may be fatal. In such cases, discontinue Perindopril Erbumine treatment immediately and observe until the swelling disappears. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, administer appropriate therapy, such as subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL), promptly. Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. 5.2 Hypotension Perindopril Erbumine can cause symptomatic hypotension. Perindopril Erbumine has been associated with hypotension in 0.3% of uncomplicated hypertensive patients in U.S. placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms related to orthostatic hypotension were reported in another 0.8% of patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea or vomiting [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. ACE inhibitors may cause excessive hypotension, and may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and death. In patients with ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease, an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or a cerebrovascular accident. In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, Perindopril Erbumine therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. Patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of Perindopril Erbumine and/or diuretic is increased. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed immediately in a supine position and, if necessary, treated with an intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Perindopril Erbumine treatment can usually be continued following restoration of volume and blood pressure. 5.3 Neutropenia / Agranulocytosis ACE inhibitors have been associated with agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, most frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially patients with a collagen vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected discontinue Perindopril Erbumine Tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.5 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. Renal function should be monitored periodically in patients receiving Perindopril Erbumine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )], [see Drug Interactions ( 7.8 )]. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, where renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with ACE inhibitors, including Perindopril Erbumine, may be associated with oliguria, progressive azotemia, and, rarely, acute renal failure and death. In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur; usually reversible upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some Perindopril Erbumine-treated patients have developed minor and transient increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine especially in those concomitantly treated with a diuretic. 5.6 Hyperkalemia Elevations of serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including Perindopril Erbumine. Most cases were isolated single values that did not appear clinically relevant and were rarely a cause for withdrawal. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and the concomitant use of agents such as potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically in patients receiving Perindopril Erbumine. 5.7 Cough Presumably because of the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough. 5.8 Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. 5.9 Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, Perindopril Erbumine may block angiotensin II formation that would otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension attributable to this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion."
