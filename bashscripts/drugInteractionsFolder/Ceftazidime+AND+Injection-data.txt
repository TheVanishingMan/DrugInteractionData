        "Drug Interactions Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of cephalosporins with aminoglycoside antibiotics or potent diuretics such as furosemide. Renal function should be carefully monitored, especially if higher dosages of the aminoglycosides are to be administered or if therapy is prolonged, because of the potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were not noted when ceftazidime was given alone in clinical trials. Chloramphenicol has been shown to be antagonistic to beta-lactam antibiotics, including ceftazidime, based on in vitro studies and time kill curves with enteric gram-negative bacilli. Due to the possibility of antagonism in vivo, particularly when bactericidal activity is desired, this drug combination should be avoided. In common with other antibiotics, ceftazidime may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Ceftazidime is generally well tolerated. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with the administration of ceftazidime was low in clinical trials. The most common were local reactions following IV injection and allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. Other adverse reactions were encountered infrequently. No disulfiram-like reactions were reported. The following adverse effects from clinical trials were considered to be either related to ceftazidime therapy or were of uncertain etiology: Local Effects, reported in fewer than 2% of patients, were phlebitis and inflammation at the site of injection (1 in 69 patients). Hypersensitivity Reactions, reported in 2% of patients, were pruritus, rash, and fever. Immediate reactions, generally manifested by rash and/or pruritus, occurred in 1 in 285 patients. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have also been reported with cephalosporin antibiotics, including ceftazidime. Angioedema and anaphylaxis (bronchospasm and/or hypotension) have been reported very rarely. Gastrointestinal Symptoms, reported in fewer than 2% of patients, were diarrhea (1 in 78), nausea (1 in 156), vomiting (1 in 500), and abdominal pain (1 in 416). The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after treatment (see WARNINGS). Central Nervous System Reactions (fewer than 1%) included headache, dizziness, and paresthesia. Seizures have been reported with several cephalosporins, including ceftazidime. In addition, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported in renally impaired patients treated with unadjusted dosing regimens of ceftazidime (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Less Frequent Adverse Events (fewer than 1%) were candidiasis (including oral thrush) and vaginitis. Hematologic Rare cases of hemolytic anemia have been reported. Laboratory Test Changes noted during clinical trials with ceftazidime were transient and included: eosinophilia (1 in 13), positive Coombs test without hemolysis (1 in 23), thrombocytosis (1 in 45), and slight elevations in one or more of the hepatic enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) (1 in 16), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) (1 in 15), LDH (1 in 18), GGT (1 in 19), and alkaline phosphatase (1 in 23). As with some other cephalosporins, transient elevations of blood urea, blood urea nitrogen, and/or serum creatinine were observed occasionally. Transient leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytosis were seen very rarely. Postmarketing Experience with Ceftazidime Products In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials, the following events have been observed during clinical practice in patients treated with ceftazidime and were reported spontaneously. For some of these events, data are insufficient to allow an estimate of incidence or to establish causation. General Anaphylaxis; allergic reactions, which, in rare instances, were severe (e.g., cardiopulmonary arrest); urticaria; pain at injection site. Hepatobiliary Tract Hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice. Renal and Genitourinary Renal impairment. Cephalosporin-Class Adverse Reactions In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with ceftazidime, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics: Adverse Reactions Colitis, toxic nephropathy, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage. Altered Laboratory Tests Prolonged prothrombin time, false-positive test for urinary glucose, pancytopenia.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions to ceftazidime are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hemolytic Anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Neurologic Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions occurring in less than 2% of patients include: hypersensitivity reactions, gastrointestinal symptoms, and central nervous system reactions. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact B. Braun Medical Inc. at 1-800-227-2862 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than or equal to 2% of patients from clinical trials: Local reactions including phlebitis and inflammation at the site of injection. Hypersensitivity reactions including pruritus, rash, fever and immediate reactions, generally manifested by rash and/or pruritus. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have also been reported with cephalosporin antibiotics, including ceftazidime. Angioedema and anaphylaxis (bronchospasm and/or hypotension) have been reported. Gastrointestinal reactions including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after treatment. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Central nervous system reactions included headache, dizziness, and paresthesia. Seizures have been reported with several cephalosporins, including ceftazidime. In addition, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonus have been reported in patients with renal impairment treated with unadjusted dosing regimens of ceftazidime. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hematologic reactions including cases of hemolytic anemia have been reported. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Other adverse reactions include candidiasis (including oral thrush) and vaginitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postapproval use of ceftazidime. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to readily estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Anaphylaxis, allergic reactions, which, in rare instances, were severe (e.g., cardiopulmonary arrest), urticaria. Nephropathy, which may be severe (e.g., renal failure). Hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice. Pain at the injection site. 6.3 Cephalosporin-class Adverse Reactions In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with ceftazidime, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibacterials: Adverse Reactions: hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, and pancytopenia. Altered Laboratory Tests: Prolonged prothrombin time, false-positive test for urinary glucose. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions: Include anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions. Cross-hypersensitivity may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue the drug. (5.1) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: May range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.3) Neurologic Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment: Include life-threatening or fatal occurrences of encephalopathy, myoclonus, or seizures. Dose adjustment is required for patients with CrCL less than or equal to 50 mL/min. (2.3, 5.4) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions to Ceftazidime, Cephalosporins, Penicillins, or Other Drugs Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to ceftazidime have been reported. Careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions with cephalosporins or penicillins. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients because cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterials has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Ceftazidime for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP occurs, discontinue the drug. 5.2 Hemolytic Anemia An immune mediated hemolytic anemia has been observed in patients receiving cephalosporin class antibacterials including ceftazidime. Severe cases of hemolytic anemia, including fatalities, have been reported during treatment with cephalosporin class antibiotics in both adults and children. If a patient develops anemia while on ceftazidime, the diagnosis of a cephalosporin associated anemia should be considered and ceftazidime stopped until the etiology is determined. 5.3 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ceftazidime, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.4 Neurologic Adverse Reactions in Patients with Renal Impairment Elevated levels of ceftazidime in patients with renal impairment can lead to seizures, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonus. Continued dosage should be determined by degree of renal impairment, severity of infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.5 Hypersensitivity to Dextrose-containing Products Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with administration of dextrose containing products. These reactions have been reported in patients receiving high concentrations of dextrose (i.e. 50% dextrose). The reactions have also been reported when corn-derived dextrose solutions were administered to patients with or without a history of hypersensitivity to corn products. 5.6 Risk of Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria Prescribing Ceftazidime for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. As with other antimicrobials, prolonged use of Ceftazidime for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. Should superinfection occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.7 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Prothrombin Time Many cephalosporins, including ceftazidime, have been associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk, and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated. Urinary Glucose The administration of ceftazidime may result in a false-positive reaction with glucose in the urine when using CLINITEST(R) tablets. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (e.g., CLINISTIX(R)) be used. 5.8 Inadvertent Intra-arterial Administration Distal necrosis can occur after inadvertent intra-arterial administration of ceftazidime."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Probenecid In vitro, avibactam is a substrate of OAT1 and OAT3 transporters which might contribute to the active uptake from the blood compartment, and thereby its excretion. As a potent OAT inhibitor, probenecid inhibits OAT uptake of avibactam by 56% to 70% in vitro and, therefore, has the potential to decrease the elimination of avibactam when co-administered. Because a clinical interaction study of AVYCAZ or avibactam alone with probenecid has not been conducted, co-administration of AVYCAZ with probenecid is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The administration of ceftazidime may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine with certain methods. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be used."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section: Decreased Clinical Response in Patients with Baseline CrCl of 30 to 50 mL/min [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Central Nervous System Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence of >= 10% in either indication) are vomiting, nausea, constipation, and anxiety. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Forest Laboratories, LLC, at 1-800-678-1605 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. AVYCAZ was evaluated in two active-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials, one each in cIAI and cUTI, including pyelonephritis. The Phase 2 trials included a total of 169 adult patients treated with AVYCAZ and 169 patients treated with comparators. Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections The Phase 2 cIAI trial included 101 adult patients treated with AVYCAZ 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 0.5 grams) administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 8 hours plus 500 mg metronidazole administered intravenously over 60 minutes every 8 hours and 102 patients treated with meropenem. The median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 41 years (range 18 to 79 years). Patients were predominantly male (69.3%) and Caucasian (55.4%). Patients with an estimated baseline CrCl 50 mL/min or less were excluded. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 9/101 (8.9%) of patients receiving AVYCAZ (with metronidazole) and 11/102 (10.8%) of patients receiving meropenem. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in patients receiving AVYCAZ were skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (3%). Adverse reactions occurring in 10% or more of patients receiving AVYCAZ were vomiting and nausea. Increased Mortality In a Phase 3 cIAI trial, death occurred in 2.5% (13/529) of patients who received AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and in 1.5% (8/529) of patients who received meropenem. Among a subgroup of patients with baseline CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min, death occurred in 25.8% (8/31) of patients who received AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and in 8.6% (3/35) of patients who received meropenem. Within this subgroup, patients treated with AVYCAZ received a 33% lower daily dose than is currently recommended for patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (baseline CrCl greater than 50 mL/min), death occurred in 1.0% (5/498) of patients who received AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and in 1.0% (5/494) of patients who received meropenem. The causes of death varied and contributing factors included progression of underlying infection, baseline pathogens isolated that were unlikely to respond to the study drug, and delayed surgical intervention. Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Pyelonephritis The Phase 2 cUTI trial included 68 adult patients treated with AVYCAZ administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 8 hours and 67 patients treated with imipenem-cilastatin (0.5 grams intravenously every 6 hours). The dose of AVYCAZ in this trial was 0.625 grams (ceftazidime 0.5 grams and avibactam 0.125 grams), which is lower than the recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 47.5 years (range 18 to 85 years). Patients were predominantly female (75%) and Caucasian (58.8%). Patients with CrCl less than 70 mL/min were excluded. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 6/68 (8.8%) of patients receiving AVYCAZ and 2/67 (3.0%) of patients receiving imipenem-cilastatin. Two patients prematurely discontinued treatment with AVYCAZ: one due to an accidental overdose and one due to atrial fibrillation. Adverse reactions occurring in 10% or more of patients receiving AVYCAZ were constipation and anxiety. Table 5 lists adverse reactions occurring in 5% or more of patients receiving AVYCAZ in the Phase 2 cIAI trial or the Phase 2 cUTI trial. Table 5.

Blood and lymphatic disorders - Eosinophilia, Thrombocytopenia Investigations - Increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, Prolonged prothrombin time Metabolism and nutrition disorders - Hypokalemia Renal and urinary disorders - Acute renal failure, Renal impairment Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders - Rash Additionally, adverse reactions reported with ceftazidime alone that were not reported in AVYCAZ clinical trials are listed below: Blood and lymphatic disorders - Agranulocytosis, Hemolytic anemia, Leukopenia, Lymphocytosis, Neutropenia, Thrombocytosis General disorders and administration site conditions - Infusion site inflammation, Injection site hematoma, Injection site phlebitis, Injection site thrombosis Hepatobiliary disorders - Jaundice Infections and infestations - Candidiasis Investigations - Increased blood lactate dehydrogenase Nervous system disorders - Dysgeusia, Paresthesia Renal and urinary disorders - Tubulointerstitial nephritis Reproductive and breast disorders - Vaginal inflammation Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders - Angioedema, Erythema multiforme, Pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Urticaria Laboratory Changes Seroconversion from a negative to a positive direct Coombs' test result occurred in 6/82 (7.3%) of patients receiving AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and 2/84 (2.4%) of patients receiving meropenem in the cIAI trial. Seroconversion from a negative to a positive direct Coombs' test result occurred in 1/52 (1.9%) of patients receiving AVYCAZ and 5/60 (8.3%) of patients receiving imipenem cilastatin in the cUTI trial. No adverse reactions representing hemolytic anemia were reported in any treatment group."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Decreased efficacy in patients with baseline CrCl of 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/ min. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of AVYCAZ accordingly. (5.1) Hypersensitivity reactions: Includes anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions. Cross-hypersensitivity may occur in patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue AVYCAZ. (5.2) Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including AVYCAZ. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.3) Central Nervous System Reactions: Seizures and other neurologic events may occur, especially in patients with renal impairment. Adjust dose in patients with renal impairment. (5.4) 5.1 Decreased Clinical Response in Patients with Baseline Creatinine Clearance of 30 to <= 50 mL/min In a Phase 3 cIAI trial, clinical cure rates were lower in a subgroup of patients with baseline CrCl of 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min compared to those with CrCl greater than 50 mL/min (Table 4). The reduction in clinical cure rates was more marked in patients treated with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole compared to meropenem-treated patients. Within this subgroup, patients treated with AVYCAZ received a 33% lower daily dose than is currently recommended for patients with CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dosage of AVYCAZ accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Table 4. Clinical Cure Rate at Test of Cure, by Baseline Renal Function - mMITT Population 1 1 Microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population included patients who had at least one bacterial pathogen at baseline and received at least one dose of study drug. AVYCAZ + Metronidazole % (n/N) Meropenem % (n/N) Normal function / mild impairment (CrCl greater than 50 mL/min) 85% (322/379) 86% (321/373) Moderate impairment (CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min) 45% (14/31) 74% (26/35) 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with AVYCAZ is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems should be made. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to a penicillin or other beta-lactam-allergic patient because cross sensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been established. Discontinue the drug if an allergic reaction to AVYCAZ occurs. 5.3 Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including AVYCAZ, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial drugs alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial drugs. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial drugs not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Manage fluid and electrolyte levels as appropriate, supplement protein intake, monitor antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated. 5.4 Central Nervous System Reactions Seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported in patients treated with ceftazidime, particularly in the setting of renal impairment. Adjust dosing based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing AVYCAZ in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Indications and Usage (1.3)]."

        "Drug Interactions Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of cephalosporins with aminoglycoside antibiotics or potent diuretics such as furosemide. Renal function should be carefully monitored, especially if higher dosages of the aminoglycosides are to be administered or if therapy is prolonged, because of the potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycosidic antibiotics. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were not noted when ceftazidime was given alone in clinical trials. Chloramphenicol has been shown to be antagonistic to beta-lactam antibiotics, including ceftazidime, based on in vitro studies and time kill curves with enteric gram-negative bacilli. Due to the possibility of antagonism in vivo, particularly when bactericidal activity is desired, this drug combination should be avoided. In common with other antibiotics, ceftazidime may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Ceftazidime is generally well tolerated. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with the administration of ceftazidime was low in clinical trials. The most common were local reactions following IV injection and allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. Other adverse reactions were encountered infrequently. No disulfiram-like reactions were reported. The following adverse effects from clinical trials were considered to be either related to ceftazidime therapy or were of uncertain etiology: Local Effects, reported in fewer than 2% of patients, were phlebitis and inflammation at the site of injection (1 in 69 patients). Hypersensitivity Reactions, reported in 2% of patients, were pruritus, rash, and fever. Immediate reactions, generally manifested by rash and/or pruritus, occurred in 1 in 285 patients. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have also been reported with cephalosporin antibiotics, including ceftazidime. Angioedema and anaphylaxis (bronchospasm and/or hypotension) have been reported very rarely. Gastrointestinal Symptoms, reported in fewer than 2% of patients, were diarrhea (1 in 78), nausea (1 in 156), vomiting (1 in 500), and abdominal pain (1 in 416). The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after treatment (see WARNINGS). Central Nervous System Reactions (fewer than 1%) included headache, dizziness, and paresthesia. Seizures have been reported with several cephalosporins, including ceftazidime. In addition, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported in renally impaired patients treated with unadjusted dosing regimens of ceftazidime (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Less Frequent Adverse Events (fewer than 1%) were candidiasis (including oral thrush) and vaginitis. Hematologic: Rare cases of hemolytic anemia have been reported. Laboratory Test Changes noted during clinical trials with FORTAZ were transient and included: eosinophilia (1 in 13), positive Coombs test without hemolysis (1 in 23), thrombocytosis (1 in 45), and slight elevations in one or more of the hepatic enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) (1 in 16), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) (1 in 15), LDH (1 in 18), GGT (1 in 19), and alkaline phosphatase (1 in 23). As with some other cephalosporins, transient elevations of blood urea, blood urea nitrogen, and/or serum creatinine were observed occasionally. Transient leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytosis were seen very rarely."
