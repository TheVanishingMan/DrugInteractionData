        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See also Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir with other drugs can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of darunavir. The potential drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (4, 5.5, 7, 12.3). 7.1 Potential for PREZISTA/ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs PREZISTA co-administered with ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A, CYP2D6, and P-gp. Co-administration of PREZISTA and ritonavir with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6, or are transported by P-gp may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events (see Table 11). 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Darunavir Darunavir and ritonavir are metabolized by CYP3A. In vitro data indicate that darunavir may be a P-gp substrate. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A, or P-gp may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (see Table 11). 7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 11 provides dosing recommendations as a result of drug interactions with PREZISTA/ritonavir. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy. Table 11: Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alterations in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) for Magnitude of Interaction, Tables 14 and 15] Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Darunavir or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV-1-Antiviral Agents: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) didanosine ↔ darunavir ↔ didanosine Didanosine should be administered one hour before or two hours after PREZISTA/ritonavir (which are administered with food). HIV-1-Antiviral Agents: HIV-Protease Inhibitors (PIs) indinavir (The reference regimen for indinavir was indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg twice daily.) ↑ darunavir ↑ indinavir The appropriate dose of indinavir in combination with PREZISTA/ritonavir has not been established. lopinavir/ritonavir ↓ darunavir ↔ lopinavir Appropriate doses of the combination have not been established. Hence, it is not recommended to co-administer lopinavir/ritonavir and PREZISTA, with or without ritonavir. saquinavir ↓ darunavir ↔ saquinavir Appropriate doses of the combination have not been established. Hence, it is not recommended to co-administer saquinavir and PREZISTA, with or without ritonavir. HIV-1-Antiviral Agents: CCR5 co-receptor antagonists maraviroc ↑ maraviroc When used in combination with PREZISTA/ritonavir, the dose of maraviroc should be 150 mg twice daily. Other Agents Antiarrhythmics: e.g. amiodarone, bepridil, disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine (systemic), mexiletine, propafenone, quinidine, ↑ antiarrhythmics Therapeutic concentration monitoring, if available, is recommended for antiarrhythmics when co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir. digoxin ↑ digoxin The lowest dose of digoxin should initially be prescribed. The serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect. Antibacterial: clarithromycin ↔ darunavir ↑ clarithromycin No dose adjustment of the combination is required for patients with normal renal function. For co-administration of clarithromycin and PREZISTA/ritonavir in patients with renal impairment, the following dose adjustments should be considered: For subjects with CLcr of 30–60 mL/min, the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%. For subjects with CLcr of < 30 mL/min, the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 75%. Anticoagulant: apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, ↑ anticoagulant Concomitant use of apixaban and PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended. The combination of PREZISTA/ritonavir and dabigatran etexilate is not recommended in specific renal impairment groups, depending on the indication. Please see the dabigatran US prescribing information for specific recommendations. rivaroxaban Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir and rivaroxaban is not recommended. ↓ warfarin warfarin ↔ darunavir Warfarin concentrations are decreased when co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir. It is recommended that the international normalized ratio (INR) be monitored when warfarin is combined with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Anticonvulsant: carbamazepine ↔ darunavir ↑ carbamazepine The dose of either darunavir/ritonavir or carbamazepine does not need to be adjusted when initiating co-administration with darunavir/ritonavir and carbamazepine. Clinical monitoring of carbamazepine concentrations and its dose titration is recommended to achieve the desired clinical response. Anticonvulsant: phenobarbital, phenytoin ↔ darunavir ↓ phenytoin ↓ phenobarbital Phenytoin and phenobarbital levels should be monitored when co-administering with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Antidepressant: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): paroxetine, sertraline ↓ paroxetine ↓ sertraline If either sertraline or paroxetine is initiated in patients receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir, dose titrating the SSRI based on a clinical assessment of antidepressant response is recommended. Monitor for antidepressant response in patients on a stable dose of sertraline or paroxetine who start treatment with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs): amitriptyline, desipramine imipramine, nortriptyline ↑ amitriptyline ↑ desipramine ↑ imipramine ↑ nortriptyline Use a lower dose of the tricyclic antidepressants and trazodone due to potential increased adverse events such as nausea, dizziness, hypotension and syncope. Other: trazodone ↑ trazodone Antifungals: itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole voriconazole ↑ darunavir ↑ itraconazole (not studied) ↑ ketoconazole ↔ posaconazole (not studied) Monitor for increased PREZISTA/ritonavir adverse events with concomitant use of itraconazole, ketoconazole, or posaconazole. When co-administration is required, the daily dose of ketoconazole or itraconazole should not exceed 200 mg with monitoring for increased antifungal adverse events. ↓ voriconazole (not studied) Voriconazole is not recommended for patients receiving darunavir/ritonavir unless an assessment comparing predicted benefit to risk ratio justifies the use of voriconazole. Anti-gout: colchicine ↑ colchicine Treatment of gout-flares – co-administration of colchicine in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir: 0.6 mg (1 tablet) × 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Treatment course to be repeated no earlier than 3 days. Prophylaxis of gout-flares – co-administration of colchicine in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir: If the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day. If the original regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day. Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever – co-administration of colchicine in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir: maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day). Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir with colchicine in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is CONTRAINDICATED. Antimalarials: artemether/lumefantrine ↓ artemether ↓ dihydroartemisinin ↑ lumefantrine ↔ darunavir The combination of PREZISTA/ritonavir and artemether/lumefantrine can be used without dose adjustments. However, the combination should be used with caution as increased lumefantrine exposure may increase the risk of QT prolongation. Antimycobacterial: rifabutin ↑ darunavir ↑ rifabutin ↑ 25-O-desacetylrifabutin Dose reduction of rifabutin by at least 75% of the usual dose (300 mg once daily) is recommended (i.e., a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day). Increased monitoring for adverse events is warranted in patients receiving this combination and further dose reduction of rifabutin may be necessary. The reference regimen for rifabutin was 300 mg once daily rifapentine ↓ darunavir Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir with rifapentine is not recommended. Antineoplastics: dasatinib nilotinib vinblastine vincristine ↑Antineoplastics A decrease in the dosage or an adjustment of the dosing interval of dasatinib and nilotinib may be necessary for patients. Please refer to the dasatinib and nilotinib prescribing information for dosing instructions. For vincristine and vinblastine, consideration should be given to temporarily withholding the ritonavir-containing antiretroviral regimen in patients who develop significant hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects when PREZISTA/ritonavir is administered concurrently with vincristine or vinblastine. If the antiretroviral regimen must be withheld for a prolonged period, consideration should be given to initiating a revised regimen that does not include a CYP3A or P-gp inhibitor. Antipsychotics: quetiapine ↑ quetiapine Initiation of PREZISTA with ritonavir in patients taking quetiapine: Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures. If co-administration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring. Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking PREZISTA with ritonavir: Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine. e.g. risperidone, thioridazine ↑ antipsychotics A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir. β-Blockers: e.g. carvedilol, metoprolol, timolol ↑ beta-blockers Clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. A dose decrease may be needed for these drugs when co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir and a lower dose of the beta blocker should be considered. Calcium Channel Blockers: amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nicardipine nifedipine, verapamil ↑ calcium channel blockers Clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. Corticosteroid (systemic): dexamethasone ↓ darunavir Systemic dexamethasone induces CYP3A and can thereby decrease darunavir plasma concentrations. This may result in loss of therapeutic effect to PREZISTA. Corticosteroid (systemic): metabolized by CYP3A e.g. budesonide prednisolone ↑ corticosteroid Concomitant use of corticosteroids metabolized by CYP3A may increase the risk for development of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression. Alternatives should be considered, particularly for long-term use. Corticosteroid (inhaled/nasal): budesonide, fluticasone ↑ corticosteroid Alternatives should be considered, particularly for long-term use. Endothelin receptor antagonists: bosentan ↑ bosentan Co-administration of bosentan in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir: In patients who have been receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir for at least 10 days, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability. Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir in patients on bosentan: Discontinue use of bosentan at least 36 hours prior to initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir. After at least 10 days following the initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir, resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability. simeprevir ↑ simeprevir ↑ darunavir Co-administration of darunavir/ritonavir and simeprevir is not recommended Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Direct-Acting Agents: NS3-4A protease inhibitors: boceprevir telaprevir ↓ darunavir ↓ boceprevir ↓ telaprevir Co-administration of boceprevir or telaprevir and PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin ↑ HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir with HMG-Co A reductase inhibitors may lead to adverse events such as myopathy. Titrate atorvastatin, pravastatin or rosuvastatin dose carefully and use the lowest necessary dose while monitoring for adverse events. Do not exceed atorvastatin 20 mg/day. Immunosuppressants: e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus ↑ immunosuppressants Therapeutic concentration monitoring of the immunosuppressive agent is recommended when co-administered with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Immunosuppressants/neoplastic: everolimus Co-administration of everolimus and PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended. Inhaled beta agonist: salmeterol ↑ salmeterol Co-administration of salmeterol and PREZISTA/ritonavir is not recommended. The combination may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations and sinus tachycardia. Narcotic Analgesic/Treatment of Opioid Dependence: buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone ↔ buprenorphine, naloxone ↑ norbuprenorphine (metabolite) ↓ methadone No adjustment of methadone dosage is required when initiating co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir. However, clinical monitoring is recommended as the dose of methadone during maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients. No dose adjustment for buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone is required with concurrent administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir. Clinical monitoring is recommended if PREZISTA/ritonavir and buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone are coadministered. Oral Contraceptives/estrogen: ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone ↓ ethinyl estradiol ↓ norethindrone Alternative methods of nonhormonal contraception are recommended. PDE-5 inhibitors: e.g. avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil ↑ PDE-5 inhibitors (only the use of sildenafil at doses used for treatment of erectile dysfunction has been studied with PREZISTA/ritonavir) Co-administration with PREZISTA/ritonavir may result in an increase in PDE-5 inhibitor-associated adverse events, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances and priapism. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): Use of sildenafil is contraindicated when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [see Contraindications (4) ]. The following dose adjustments are recommended for use of tadalafil with PREZISTA/ritonavir: Co-administration of tadalafil in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir: In patients receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir for at least one week, start tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir in patients on tadalafil: Avoid use of tadalafil during the initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir. Stop tadalafil at least 24 hours prior to starting PREZISTA/ritonavir. After at least one week following the initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir, resume tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction: Sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg dose in 72 hours, or tadalafil at a single dose not exceeding 10 mg dose in 72 hours can be used with increased monitoring for PDE-5 inhibitor-associated adverse events. Co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir and avanafil is not recommended. Sedatives/Hypnotics: Metabolized by CYP3A e.g. buspirone, diazepam, estazolam, parenterally administered midazolam, zoldipem ↑ sedatives/hypnotics Titration is recommended when co-administering PREZISTA/ritonavir with sedatives/hypnotics metabolized by CYP3A and a lower dose of the sedatives/hypnotics should be considered with monitoring for adverse events. Co-administration of parenteral midazolam should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. Co-administration of oral midazolam or triazolam with PREZISTA/ritonavir is CONTRAINDICATED. In addition to the drugs included in Table 11, the interaction between PREZISTA/ritonavir and the following drugs were evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustments are needed for either drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]: atazanavir, efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, omeprazole, ranitidine, and rilpivirine. Using cross-trial comparisons to historical pharmacokinetic data, dolutegravir did not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of darunavir. Darunavir/ritonavir had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir. Pitavastatin had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir/ritonavir. Acid modifying medications are not predicted to alter darunavir exposure. Other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs ): Based on the different elimination pathways of the other NRTIs (abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, zidovudine) that are primarily renally excreted, no drug interactions are expected for these drugs and PREZISTA/ritonavir. Other PIs: The co-administration of PREZISTA/ritonavir and PIs other than lopinavir/ritonavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, and indinavir has not been studied. Therefore, such co-administration is not recommended. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors: No dose adjustments are needed for either raltegravir or darunavir based on pharmacokinetic data from literature references. Please refer to the elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate U.S. prescribing information for information regarding concomitant use with other antiretroviral medications."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The overall safety profile of PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily and PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily is based on clinical trials and post-marketing data, and is consistent with the data presented below. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Due to the need for co-administration of PREZISTA with ritonavir, please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for ritonavir-associated adverse reactions. The most common clinical adverse drug reactions to PREZISTA/ritonavir (incidence greater than or equal to 5%) of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) were diarrhea, nausea, rash, headache, abdominal pain and vomiting. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Products, LP at 1-800-JANSSEN (1-800-526-7736) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience: Treatment-Naïve Adults Study TMC114-C211 The safety assessment is based on all safety data from the Phase 3 trial TMC114-C211 comparing PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily versus lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg per day in 689 antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected adult subjects. The total mean exposure for subjects in the PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily arm and in the lopinavir/ritonavir 800/200 mg per day arm was 162.5 and 153.5 weeks, respectively. The majority of the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported during treatment with PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily were mild in severity. The most common clinical ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (greater than or equal to 5%) of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) were diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain and rash. 2.3% of subjects in the PREZISTA/ritonavir arm discontinued treatment due to ADRs. ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected adult subjects are presented in Table 7 and subsequent text below the table.

The pharmacokinetic exposure in co-infected subjects was comparable to that in subjects without co-infection. 6.5 Clinical Trials Experience: Pediatric Patients PREZISTA/ritonavir has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents in 3 Phase II trials. TMC114-C212, in which 80 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 6 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 20 kg were included, TMC114-C228, in which 21 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 6 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg were included, and TMC114-C230 in which 12 antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected pediatric patients aged from 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg were included. The TMC114-C212 and C228 trials evaluated PREZISTA/ritonavir twice daily dosing and the TMC114-C230 trial evaluated PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Frequency, type, and severity of ADRs in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults. Study TMC114-C212 Clinical ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 3%), were vomiting (13%), diarrhea (11%), abdominal pain (10%), headache (9%), rash (5%), nausea (4%) and fatigue (3%). Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were ALT increased (Grade 3: 3%; Grade 4: 1%), AST increased (Grade 3: 1%), pancreatic amylase increased (Grade 3: 4%, Grade 4: 1%), pancreatic lipase increased (Grade 3: 1%), total cholesterol increased (Grade 3: 1%), and LDL increased (Grade 3: 3%). Study TMC114-C228 Clinical ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 5%), were diarrhea (24%), vomiting (19%), rash (19%), abdominal pain (5%) and anorexia (5%). There were no Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities considered as ADRs in this study. Study TMC114-C230 Clinical ADRs to PREZISTA/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 3%), were vomiting (33%), nausea (25%), diarrhea (16.7%), abdominal pain (8.3%), decreased appetite (8.3%), pruritus (8.3%), and rash (8.3%). There were no Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities considered as ADRs in this study. 6.6 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during post approval use of PREZISTA. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Redistribution of body fat has been reported. Rarely, rhabdomyolysis (associated with co-administration with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and PREZISTA/ritonavir) has been reported. In addition, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported rarely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have been reported. (5.2, 6) Skin reactions ranging from mild to severe, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, have been reported. Discontinue treatment if severe reaction develops. (5.3, 6) Use with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. (5.4) The concomitant use of PREZISTA/ritonavir and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. (5.5, 7.3) Patients may develop new onset diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. Initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. (5.6) Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) or immune reconstitution syndrome. (5.8) Patients with hemophilia may develop increased bleeding events. (5.9) PREZISTA/ritonavir should not be used in pediatric patients below 3 years of age in view of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir up to days 23 to 26 of age. (5.11) 5.1 General PREZISTA must be co-administered with ritonavir and food to achieve the desired antiviral effect. Failure to administer PREZISTA with ritonavir and food may result in a loss of efficacy of darunavir. Please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for additional information on precautionary measures. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with PREZISTA/ritonavir. During the clinical development program (N=3063), hepatitis was reported in 0.5% of patients receiving combination therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for liver function abnormalities including severe hepatic adverse events. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have been reported. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications, having co-morbidities including hepatitis B or C co-infection, and/or developing immune reconstitution syndrome. A causal relationship with PREZISTA/ritonavir therapy has not been established. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir and patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of PREZISTA/ritonavir treatment. Evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir should prompt consideration of interruption or discontinuation of treatment. 5.3 Severe Skin Reactions During the clinical development program (n=3063), severe skin reactions, accompanied by fever and/or elevations of transaminases in some cases, have been reported in 0.4% of subjects. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was rarely (less than 0.1%) reported during the clinical development program. During post-marketing experience toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Discontinue PREZISTA/ritonavir immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include but are not limited to severe rash or rash accompanied with fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia. Rash (all grades, regardless of causality) occurred in 10.3% of subjects treated with PREZISTA/ritonavir [also see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Rash was mostly mild-to-moderate, often occurring within the first four weeks of treatment and resolving with continued dosing. The discontinuation rate due to rash in subjects using PREZISTA/ritonavir was 0.5%. Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing PREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to subjects receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir without raltegravir or raltegravir without PREZISTA/ritonavir. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash. 5.4 Sulfa Allergy Darunavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. PREZISTA should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. In clinical studies with PREZISTA/ritonavir, the incidence and severity of rash were similar in subjects with or without a history of sulfonamide allergy. 5.5 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions due to Drug Interactions Initiation of PREZISTA/ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of PREZISTA/ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to: Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications. Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of PREZISTA/ritonavir. Loss of therapeutic effect of PREZISTA/ritonavir and possible development of resistance. See Table 11 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PREZISTA/ritonavir therapy; review concomitant medications during PREZISTA/ritonavir therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.6 Diabetes Mellitus / Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued PI therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between PI therapy and these events have not been established. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including PREZISTA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of antiretroviral treatment. 5.9 Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship between PI therapy and these episodes has not been established. 5.10 Resistance/Cross-Resistance Because the potential for HIV cross-resistance among PIs has not been fully explored in PREZISTA/ritonavir treated patients, the effect therapy with PREZISTA will have on the activity of subsequently administered PIs is unknown [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 5.11 Pediatric Patients Do not administer PREZISTA/ritonavir in pediatric patients below 3 years of age in view of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir (from 20 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg) up to days 23 to 26 of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction trials have been performed with PREZCOBIX or with darunavir coadministered with cobicistat as single entities. Drug interaction trials have been conducted with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir and with cobicistat alone. Coadministration of PREZCOBIX with other drugs can alter the concentration of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of darunavir or cobicistat. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. ( , , , ). 4 5.6 7 12.3 7.1 Potential for PREZCOBIX to Affect Other Drugs When evaluated separately, darunavir and cobicistat both inhibited CYP3A and CYP2D6. Cobicistat inhibits the following transporters: p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Therefore, coadministration of PREZCOBIX with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and can be associated with adverse events (see ). Based on data, cobicistat is not expected to induce CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 and based on data, cobicistat is not expected to induce MDR1 or, in general, CYP3A to a clinically significant extent. The induction effect of cobicistat on CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or UGT1A1 is unknown, but is expected to be low based on CYP3A induction data. Table 2 in vitro in vivo in vitro 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect PREZCOBIX Darunavir is metabolized by CYP3A. Cobicistat is metabolized by CYP3A, and to a minor extent, by CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity are expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and cobicistat, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of darunavir and cobicistat which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Coadministration of PREZCOBIX and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and cobicistat (see ). Table 2 7.3 Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 2 provides dosing recommendations for expected clinically relevant interactions with PREZCOBIX. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction trials or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy. Table 2: Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alterations in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Trials or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Darunavir, Cobicistat, or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV-1 Antiviral Agents: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) didanosine ↔ darunavir ↔ cobicistat ↔ didanosine Didanosine should be administered one hour before or two hours after PREZCOBIX (administered with food).

( ) 6 To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Products, LP at 1-800-JANSSEN (1-800-526-7736) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. During the darunavir clinical development program, where darunavir was coadministered with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily, the most common clinical adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 5%) of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) were diarrhea, nausea, rash, headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting. See the darunavir full prescribing information for additional information on adverse reactions reported with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir. See cobicistat full prescribing information for clinical trial information on adverse reactions reported with cobicistat. One single arm clinical trial was conducted with darunavir and cobicistat administered as single entities in 313 HIV-infected subjects. Adverse reactions evaluated through Week 24 did not differ substantially from those reported in clinical trials with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience See the darunavir full prescribing information for postmarketing information."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis), liver injury, including some fatalities can occcur with PREZCOBIX. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases. ( , ) 5.1 6 Skin reactions ranging from mild to severe, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, can occur with PREZCOBIX. Discontinue treatment if severe reaction develops. ( , ) 5.2 6 Assess creatinine clearance (CLcr) before initiating treatment. ( ) 5.3 When PREZCOBIX is used in combination with a tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) containing regimen, cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome have been reported. ( ) 5.4 When used with tenofovir DF: Assess urine glucose and urine protein at baseline and monitor CLcr, urine glucose, and urine protein. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients with or at risk for renal impairment. ( ) 5.4 PREZCOBIX is not recommended in combination with other antiretroviral drugs that require pharmacokinetic boosting. ( ) 5.6 Monitor in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. ( ) 5.7 Patients receiving PREZCOBIX may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia ( ), redistribution/accumulation of body fat ( ), and immune reconstitution syndrome( ). 5.8 5.7 5.9 Patients with hemophilia may develop increased bleeding events. ( ) 5.11 5.1 Hepatotoxicity During the darunavir clinical development program (N=3063), where darunavir was coadministered with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily, drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) was reported in 0.5% of subjects. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for liver function abnormalities including severe hepatic adverse reactions. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have also been reported with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications, having co-morbidities including hepatitis B or C co-infection, and/or developing immune reconstitution syndrome. A causal relationship with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir has not been established. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZCOBIX and patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of PREZCOBIX treatment. Evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients on PREZCOBIX should prompt consideration of interruption or discontinuation of treatment. 5.2 Severe Skin Reactions During the darunavir clinical development program (n=3063), where darunavir was coadministered with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily, severe skin reactions, accompanied by fever and/or elevations of transaminases in some cases, was reported in 0.4% of subjects. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was rarely (less than 0.1%) reported during the clinical development program. During post-marketing experience toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Discontinue PREZCOBIX immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include but are not limited to severe rash or rash accompanied with fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia. Mild-to-moderate rash was also reported and often occurred within the first four weeks of treatment and resolved with continued dosing. 5.3 Effects on Serum Creatinine Cobicistat decreases estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function. This effect should be considered when interpreting changes in estimated creatinine clearance in patients initiating PREZCOBIX, particularly in patients with medical conditions or receiving drugs needing monitoring with estimated creatinine clearance. Prior to initiating therapy with PREZCOBIX, assess estimated creatinine clearance [ ]. Dosage recommendations are not available for drugs that require dosage adjustments in PREZCOBIX-treated patients with renal impairment [ ]. Consider alternative medications that do not require dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment. see Dosage and Administration (2.4) see , Drug Interactions (7.3) Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) Although cobicistat may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function, patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg/dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. 5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment When Used with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, has been reported when cobicistat, a component of PREZCOBIX, was used in an antiretroviral regimen that contained tenofovir DF. Coadministration of PREZCOBIX and tenofovir DF is not recommended in patients who have an estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min . [see ] Dosage and Administration (2.3) Document urine glucose and urine protein at baseline and perform routine monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein during treatment when PREZCOBIX is used with tenofovir DF. Measure serum phosphorus in patients with or at risk for renal impairment when used with tenofovir DF. [see ] Dosage and Administration (2.2) Coadministration of PREZCOBIX and tenofovir DF in combination with concomitant or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent is not recommended. See cobicistat full prescribing information for additional information regarding cobicistat. 5.5 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions Initiation of PREZCOBIX, which inhibits CYP3A, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A, or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PREZCOBIX may increase plasma concentrations of these medications, which may increase the risk of clinically significant adverse reactions (including life-threatening or fatal reactions) associated with the concomitant medications. Coadministration of PREZCOBIX with CYP3A inducers may lead to lower exposures of darunavir and cobicistat and loss of efficacy of darunavir and possible resistance. Therefore, consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PREZCOBIX therapy; review concomitant medications during PREZCOBIX therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs [ , ]. see Contraindications (4) Drug Interactions (7) When used with concomitant medications, PREZCOBIX may result in different drug interactions than those observed or expected with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir. Complex or unknown mechanisms of drug interactions preclude extrapolation of drug interactions with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir to certain PREZCOBIX interactions [ and ]. see Drug Interactions (7) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.6 Antiretrovirals Not Recommended PREZCOBIX is not recommended in combination with other antiretroviral drugs that require pharmacokinetic boosting (i.e., another protease inhibitor or elvitegravir) because dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established and coadministration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of the antiretroviral agents, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. PREZCOBIX is not recommended in combination with products containing the individual components of PREZCOBIX (darunavir and cobicistat) or with ritonavir. For additional recommendations on use of PREZCOBIX with other antiretroviral agents, see . Drug Interactions (7) 5.7 Sulfa Allergy Darunavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. Monitor patients with a known sulfonamide allergy after initiating PREZCOBIX. In clinical studies with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir, the incidence and severity of rash were similar in subjects with or without a history of sulfonamide allergy. 5.8 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV infected patients receiving HIV protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued PI therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between HIV PI therapy and these events have not been established. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.10 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including PREZCOBIX. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as infection, cytomegalovirus, pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Mycobacterium avium Pneumocystis jirovecii Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of antiretroviral treatment. 5.11 Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with HIV PIs. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with HIV PIs was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship between PI therapy and these episodes has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction trials have been performed with PREZCOBIX or with darunavir coadministered with cobicistat as single entities. Drug interaction trials have been conducted with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir and with cobicistat alone. Coadministration of PREZCOBIX with other drugs can alter the concentration of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of darunavir or cobicistat. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. (4, 5.6, 7, 12.3). 7.1 Potential for PREZCOBIX to Affect Other Drugs When evaluated separately, darunavir and cobicistat both inhibited CYP3A and CYP2D6. Cobicistat inhibits the following transporters: p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Therefore, coadministration of PREZCOBIX with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and can be associated with adverse events (see Table 2). Based on in vitro data, cobicistat is not expected to induce CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 and based on in vivo data, cobicistat is not expected to induce MDR1 or, in general, CYP3A to a clinically significant extent. The induction effect of cobicistat on CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or UGT1A1 is unknown, but is expected to be low based on CYP3A in vitro induction data. 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect PREZCOBIX Darunavir is metabolized by CYP3A. Cobicistat is metabolized by CYP3A, and to a minor extent, by CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity are expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and cobicistat, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of darunavir and cobicistat which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Coadministration of PREZCOBIX and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and cobicistat (see Table 2). 7.3 Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 2 provides dosing recommendations for expected clinically relevant interactions with PREZCOBIX. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction trials or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy. Table 2: Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alterations in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Trials or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Darunavir, Cobicistat, or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV-1 Antiviral Agents: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) didanosine ↔ darunavir ↔ cobicistat ↔ didanosine Didanosine should be administered one hour before or two hours after PREZCOBIX (administered with food).

Monitor for rifabutin-associated adverse reactions including neutropenia and uveitis. rifapentine ↓ darunavir Coadministration with rifapentine is not recommended. β-Blockers: e.g. carvedilol, metoprolol, timolol ↑ beta-blockers Clinical monitoring is recommended for coadministration with beta-blockers that are metabolized by CYP2D6. Calcium Channel Blockers: e.g. amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, ↑ calcium channel blockers Clinical monitoring is recommended for coadministration with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A. nifedipine, verapamil Corticosteroids (inhaled/nasal) metabolized by CYP3A: e.g. budesonide, fluticasone ↑ corticosteroid Coadministration with inhaled or nasal fluticasone or other corticosteroids that are metabolized by CYP3A may result in reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Alternative corticosteroids should be considered, particularly for long-term use. Corticosteroid systemic: e.g. dexamethasone ↓ darunavir ↓ cobicistat ↑ corticosteroids Coadministration with dexamethasone or other corticosteroids that induce CYP3A may result in loss of therapeutic effect of and development of resistance to darunavir. Consider alternative corticosteroids. Corticosteroids (systemic) metabolized by CYP3A: e.g. budesonide, prednisolone ↑ corticosteroid Coadministration with corticosteroids that are metabolized by CYP3A, particularly for long-term use, may increase the risk for development of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression. Consider the potential benefit of treatment versus the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects. Endothelin receptor antagonists: bosentan ↓ darunavir ↓ cobicistat ↑ bosentan Initiation of bosentan in patients taking PREZCOBIX: In patients who have been receiving PREZCOBIX for at least 10 days, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability. Initiation of PREZCOBIX in patients on bosentan: Discontinue use of bosentan at least 36 hours prior to initiation of PREZCOBIX. After at least 10 days following the initiation of PREZCOBIX, resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability.

(5.6) Monitor in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. (5.7) Patients receiving PREZCOBIX may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia (5.8), redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7), and immune reconstitution syndrome(5.9). Patients with hemophilia may develop increased bleeding events. (5.11) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity During the darunavir clinical development program (N=3063), where darunavir was coadministered with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily, drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) was reported in 0.5% of subjects. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for liver function abnormalities including severe hepatic adverse reactions. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have also been reported with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications, having co-morbidities including hepatitis B or C co-infection, and/or developing immune reconstitution syndrome. A causal relationship with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir has not been established. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZCOBIX and patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of PREZCOBIX treatment. Evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients on PREZCOBIX should prompt consideration of interruption or discontinuation of treatment. 5.2 Severe Skin Reactions During the darunavir clinical development program (n=3063), where darunavir was coadministered with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily, severe skin reactions, accompanied by fever and/or elevations of transaminases in some cases, was reported in 0.4% of subjects. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was rarely (less than 0.1%) reported during the clinical development program. During post-marketing experience toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Discontinue PREZCOBIX immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include but are not limited to severe rash or rash accompanied with fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia. Mild-to-moderate rash was also reported and often occurred within the first four weeks of treatment and resolved with continued dosing. 5.3 Effects on Serum Creatinine Cobicistat decreases estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting actual renal glomerular function. This effect should be considered when interpreting changes in estimated creatinine clearance in patients initiating PREZCOBIX, particularly in patients with medical conditions or receiving drugs needing monitoring with estimated creatinine clearance. Prior to initiating therapy with PREZCOBIX, assess estimated creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Dosage recommendations are not available for drugs that require dosage adjustments in PREZCOBIX-treated patients with renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Consider alternative medications that do not require dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment. Although cobicistat may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function, patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg/dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. 5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment When Used with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, has been reported when cobicistat, a component of PREZCOBIX, was used in an antiretroviral regimen that contained tenofovir DF. Coadministration of PREZCOBIX and tenofovir DF is not recommended in patients who have an estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Document urine glucose and urine protein at baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] and perform routine monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein during treatment when PREZCOBIX is used with tenofovir DF. Measure serum phosphorus in patients with or at risk for renal impairment when used with tenofovir DF. Coadministration of PREZCOBIX and tenofovir DF in combination with concomitant or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent is not recommended. See cobicistat full prescribing information for additional information regarding cobicistat. 5.5 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions Initiation of PREZCOBIX, which inhibits CYP3A, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A, or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PREZCOBIX may increase plasma concentrations of these medications, which may increase the risk of clinically significant adverse reactions (including life-threatening or fatal reactions) associated with the concomitant medications. Coadministration of PREZCOBIX with CYP3A inducers may lead to lower exposures of darunavir and cobicistat and loss of efficacy of darunavir and possible resistance. Therefore, consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PREZCOBIX therapy; review concomitant medications during PREZCOBIX therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs [see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7) ]. When used with concomitant medications, PREZCOBIX may result in different drug interactions than those observed or expected with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir. Complex or unknown mechanisms of drug interactions preclude extrapolation of drug interactions with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir to certain PREZCOBIX interactions [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Antiretrovirals Not Recommended PREZCOBIX is not recommended in combination with other antiretroviral drugs that require pharmacokinetic boosting (i.e., another protease inhibitor or elvitegravir) because dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established and coadministration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of the antiretroviral agents, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. PREZCOBIX is not recommended in combination with products containing the individual components of PREZCOBIX (darunavir and cobicistat) or with ritonavir. For additional recommendations on use of PREZCOBIX with other antiretroviral agents, see Drug Interactions (7) . 5.7 Sulfa Allergy Darunavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. Monitor patients with a known sulfonamide allergy after initiating PREZCOBIX. In clinical studies with darunavir coadministered with ritonavir, the incidence and severity of rash were similar in subjects with or without a history of sulfonamide allergy. 5.8 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV infected patients receiving HIV protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued PI therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between HIV PI therapy and these events have not been established. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.10 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including PREZCOBIX. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of antiretroviral treatment. 5.11 Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with HIV PIs. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with HIV PIs was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship between PI therapy and these episodes has not been established."
