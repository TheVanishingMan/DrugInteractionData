        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for Finasteride Tablets USP 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for finasteride tablets USP of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking finasteride tablets USP (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride tablets USP or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride Tablets USP, 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride tablets USP N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride tablets USP 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride tablets USP due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride tablets USP (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. TABLE 2 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4* (%) Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 *Combined Years 2 to 4 N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and PLESS were similar. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg but no cases in men not treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. During the 4-year placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride tablets USP, 1 mg by men is unknown. No Clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride tablets USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction:hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face); Reproductive System:sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients (5.1, 5.4). - Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1,16). - Finasteride tablets USP causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). - 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP, when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride tablets USP 5 mg showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride tablets USP may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride tablets USP 1 mg) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART)(1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in pediatric patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]."

However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). - Finasteride tablets USP may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). - Prior to initiating therapy with finasteride tablets USP, appropriate evaluation should be performed to rule out other urological conditions, including prostate cancer, that might mimic BPH (5.3, 12.3). - Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.4, 8.1, 16). - Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.5, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride tablets USP reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride tablets USP, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride tablets USP therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP. Finasteride tablets USP may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets USP. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5αreductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Evaluation for Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating therapy with finasteride tablets USP, appropriate evaluation should be performed to identify other conditions such as infection, prostate cancer, stricture disease, hypotonic bladder or other neurogenic disorders that might mimic BPH. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy. 5.4 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] 5.5 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride tablets USP is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.6 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride tablets USP for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Finasteride tablets USP are generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. TABLE 2 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences Year 1(%) Years 2, 3 and 4* (%) Finasteride Placebo Finasteride Placebo *Combined Years 2 to 4 N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 Phase III Studies and 5-Year Open Extensions The adverse experience profile in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies, the 5-year open extensions, and a long-term efficacy and safety study were similar. Long-Term Data There is no evidence of increased adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. In a 7-year placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men, 9060 had prostate needle biopsy data available for analysis. In the finasteride tablets USP group, 280 (6.4%) men had prostate cancer with Gleason scores of 7 to 10 detected on needle biopsy vs. 237 (5.1%) men in the placebo group. Of the total cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in this study, approximately 98% were classified as intracapsular (stage T1 or T2). The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. This information from the literature (Thompson IM, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, et al. The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349:213-22) is provided for consideration by physicians when finasteride tablets USP are used as indicated (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Finasteride tablets USP are not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain."

        "6ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for Finasteride 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for finasteride of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking finasteride (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride 1 mg N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for Finasteride 5 mg and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the Finasteride 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study, a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on finasteride 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride 5 mg was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. TABLE 2: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride 5 mg BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4 Combined Years 2 to 4 (%) Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with finasteride 5 mg and Finasteride 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study were similar. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride 5 mg but no cases in men not treated with finasteride 5 mg. During the 4-year placebo-controlled Finasteride 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride 5 mg. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride 5 mg, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3.0 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride 1 mg by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride 5 mg. Finasteride 5 mg is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction: hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face); Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

        "5WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Finasteride is not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients (5.1, 5.4). - Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1, 16). - Finasteride causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). - 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Finasteride is not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride, 1 mg in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride, 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride, 5 mg showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride 1 mg may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride 1 mg may also affect PSA test results. 5.3Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride 1 mg) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4Pediatric Patients Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

Any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). -5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus Finasteride is not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) .] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride, 1 mg in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride, 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride, 5 mg showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride 1 mg may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride 1 mg may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <= 3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride 1 mg) in the 7 year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS ­The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in >=1% in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Exelan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-855-295-7455 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride tablets USP are generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study ( A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study ) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. Table 1: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences Year 1(%) Years 2, 3 and 4*(%) Finasteride Placebo Finasteride Placebo *Combined Years 2 to 4 N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 Phase III Studies and 5-Year Open Extensions The adverse experience profile in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies, the 5-year open extensions, and a long-term efficacy and safety study were similar. Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years [See Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy [See Long-Term Data]. The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-­year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride tablets USP. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) - testicular pain - sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. - depression - male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride tablets USP reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride tablets USP may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets USP for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride tablets USP reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride tablets USP, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-­reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride tablets USP therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP. Finasteride tablets USP may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets USP. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) .] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride tablets USP is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride tablets USP for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets USP, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

Long-Term Data There is no evidence of increased adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3,040 men, there were two cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. In a 7-year placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men, 9,060 had prostate needle biopsy data available for analysis. In the finasteride group, 280 (6.4%) men had prostate cancer with Gleason scores of 7 to 10 detected on needle biopsy vs 237 (5.1%) men in the placebo group. Of the total cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in this study, approximately 98% were classified as intracapsular (stage T1 or T2). The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. This information from the literature (Thompson IM, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, et al. The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349:213-22) is provided for consideration by physicians when finasteride is used as indicated (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Finasteride is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain -male breast cancer."

During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and/or finasteride at lower doses. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain - erectile dysfunction (ED) that continued after discontinuation of treatment, reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions with a known association to ED. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality have been reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. Normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. - depression - decreased libido that continued after discontinuation of treatment - male breast cancer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in >=1% in patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (a Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long-Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2: Incidence >=2% in One or More Treatment Groups: Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS Adverse Experience Placebo (N=737) (%) Doxazosin 4 mg or 8 mg Doxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg). The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin.

Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4 to 6-year placebo and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride.

The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) testicular pain sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume).

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5αreductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride tablets may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride tablets 5 mg/day in the 7 year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) .] Finasteride tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1,524 patients treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg and 1,516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets 5 mg were >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. 4 Year Placebo-Controlled Study Table 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4 (%) Combined Years 2 to 4 Finasteride Placebo Finasteride Placebo N = 1,524 and 1,516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 The adverse experience profile in the 1 year, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies, the 5 year open extensions, and the long-term efficacy and safety study were similar. In the MTOPS study, 3,047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride tablets 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride tablets 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

Men received either finasteride tablets 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) In a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART*), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg. Long-Term Data High-Grade Prostate Cancer [see Indications and Usage ( ) and Warnings and Precautions ( )]. 1.3 5.2 During the 4 to 6 year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3,047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4 year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3,040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7­ year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. Breast Cancer Sexual Function 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride tablets 5 mg. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: -hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) -testicular pain -sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets 5 mg for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride tablets 5 mg in these events is unknown. -male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets 5 mg for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride tablets 5 mg in these events is unknown. -depression -male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride tablets 5 mg reduce serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride tablets 5 mg may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor ( ). 5.1 Finasteride tablets 5 mg may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer ( , ). 5.2 6.1 Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets 5 mg when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus ( , , ). 5.3 8.1 16 Finasteride tablets 5 mg are not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women ( , , , , ). 5.4 8.1 8.3 8.4 12.3 Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets 5 mg for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms ( ). 5.6 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride tablets 5 mg reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride tablets 5 mg, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets 5 mg may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α­-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride tablets 5 mg therapy may also affect PSA test results.

[See and .] Indications and Usage (1.3) Adverse Reactions (6.1) 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed.

A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for Finasteride Tablets USP 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for finasteride tablets USP of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking finasteride tablets USP (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride tablets USP or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride Tablets USP, 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride tablets USP N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride tablets USP 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride tablets USP due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride tablets USP (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. TABLE 2 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4* (%) Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 *Combined Years 2 to 4 N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and PLESS were similar. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg but no cases in men not treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. During the 4-year placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride tablets USP, 1 mg by men is unknown. No Clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride tablets USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction:hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face); Reproductive System:sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients (5.1, 5.4). - Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1,16). - Finasteride tablets USP causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). - 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP, when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride tablets USP 5 mg showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride tablets USP may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride tablets USP 1 mg) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART)(1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in pediatric patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS ­The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in >=1% in patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study ( A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study ) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. Table 1: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4* (%) Finasteride Placebo Finasteride Placebo *Combined Years 2 to 4 N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs. placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 Phase III Studies and 5-Year Open Extensions The adverse experience profile in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies, the 5-year open extensions, and a long-term efficacy and safety study were similar. Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy [see Long Term Data]. The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled a long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-­year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) - testicular pain. - sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g., reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - depression. - male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-­reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs. placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). 5α-­reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) .] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for Finasteride 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for finasteride of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking finasteride (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride Placebo N=945 N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder(Decreased Volume 1.2 0.7 of Ejaculate) (0.8) (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for Finasteride 5 mg and Dutasteride in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In a long-term efficacy and safety study, a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on finasteride 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. TABLE 2 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride 5 mg BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Year 1 Years 2, 3 and 4* (%) (%) Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo *Combined Years 2 to 4 N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with finasteride 5 mg and a long-term efficacy and safety study were similar. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year placebo-controlled a long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3.0 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Finasteride is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction: hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face; Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Neoplasms: male breast cancer; Breast disorders: breast tenderness and enlargement; Nervous System/Psychiatric: depression"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride is not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients (5.1, 5.4). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1, 16). Finasteride causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Finasteride tablets are not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride, 1 mg in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride, 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

Long-Term Data There is no evidence of increased adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During a 4- to 6-year placebo and comparator controlled study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled a long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. In a 7-year placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men, 9060 had prostate needle biopsy data available for analysis. In the finasteride group, 280 (6.4%) men had prostate cancer with Gleason scores of 7-10 detected on needle biopsy vs. 237 (5.1%) men in the placebo group. Of the total cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in this study, approximately 98% were classified as intracapsular (stage T1 or T2). The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. This information from the literature (Thompson IM, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, et al. The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349:213-22) is provided for consideration by physicians when finasteride is used as indicated (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Finasteride is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain."

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8-mg dose over the duration of the study. Long-Term Data High-Grade Prostate Cancer The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <= 3.0 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 7year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride tablets USP and/or finasteride at lower doses. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain - erectile dysfunction (ED) that continued after discontinuation of treatment, reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP forthe treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions with a known association to ED. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality have been reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP for the treatment of BPH. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. Normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. - depression - decreased libido that continued after discontinuation of treatment - male breast cancer."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS In clinical studies, finasteride tablets USP reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride tablets USP, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride tablets USP therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP. Finasteride tablets USP may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets USP. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5αreductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] Finasteride tablets USP is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. Treatment with finasteride tablets USP for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets USP, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

Long-Term Data There is no evidence of increased adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During a 4- to 6-year placebo and comparator controlled study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled a long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. In a 7-year placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men, 9060 had prostate needle biopsy data available for analysis. In the finasteride group, 280 (6.4%) men had prostate cancer with Gleason scores of 7-10 detected on needle biopsy vs. 237 (5.1%) men in the placebo group. Of the total cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in this study, approximately 98% were classified as intracapsular (stage T1 or T2). The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. This information from the literature (Thompson IM, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, et al. The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349:213-22) is provided for consideration by physicians when finasteride is used as indicated (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Finasteride is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in >=1% in patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (a Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long-Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8-mg dose over the duration of the study. Long-Term Data High-Grade Prostate Cancer The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3.0 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4 to 6-year placebo and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) testicular pain sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. depression male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: orgasm disorders"

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on Finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) .] Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with PROPECIA and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for PROPECIA (finasteride 1 mg) in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for PROPECIA of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking PROPECIA (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with PROPECIA or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for PROPECIA (finasteride 1 mg) in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS PROPECIA N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with PROPECIA, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with PROPECIA due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with PROPECIA. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of PROPECIA (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with PROPECIA, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for PROSCAR(R) (finasteride 5 mg) and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the PROSCAR Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on PROSCAR 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with PROSCAR 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on PROSCAR was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2-4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. TABLE 2: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for PROSCAR (finasteride 5 mg) BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4Combined Years 2-4 (%) Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with PROSCAR 5 mg and PLESS were similar. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with PROSCAR 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with PROSCAR but no cases in men not treated with PROSCAR. During the 4-year placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with PROSCAR. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with PROSCAR, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3.0 ng/mL. Men received either PROSCAR (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of PROPECIA by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with PROSCAR. PROSCAR is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of PROPECIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction : hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face); Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS PROPECIA is not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients (5.1, 5.4). Women should not handle crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1, 16). PROPECIA causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on PROPECIA may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus PROPECIA is not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. PROPECIA tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with PROPECIA (finasteride, 1 mg) in men 18-41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with PROSCAR (finasteride, 5 mg) when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with PROSCAR showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on PROPECIA may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with PROPECIA may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of PROPECIA) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients PROPECIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug-related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >= 1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Long-Term Data There is no evidence of increased adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3,040 men, there were two cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. In a 7-year placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men, 9,060 had prostate needle biopsy data available for analysis. In the finasteride group, 280 (6.4%) men had prostate cancer with Gleason scores of 7 to 10 detected on needle biopsy vs 237 (5.1%) men in the placebo group. Of the total cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in this study, approximately 98% were classified as intracapsular (stage T1 or T2). The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. This information from the literature (Thompson IM, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, et al. The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349:213-22) is provided for consideration by physicians when finasteride is used as indicated (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Finasteride is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain -male breast cancer."

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences.

Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4 to 6 year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat and face) - testicular pain - sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - depression - male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on Finasteride Tablets may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken Finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating therapy with Finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7 year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Long-Term Data There is no evidence of increased adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During a 4- to 6-year placebo and comparator controlled study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled a long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. In a 7-year placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men, 9060 had prostate needle biopsy data available for analysis. In the finasteride group, 280 (6.4%) men had prostate cancer with Gleason scores of 7 to 10 detected on needle biopsy vs. 237 (5.1%) men in the placebo group. Of the total cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in this study, approximately 98% were classified as intracapsular (stage T1 or T2). The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. This information from the literature (Thompson IM, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, et al. The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349:213-22) is provided for consideration by physicians when finasteride tablets USP are used as indicated (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). Finasteride tablets USP are not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain. - male breast cancer."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience PROSCAR is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (PLESS) In PLESS, 1524 patients treated with PROSCAR and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with PROSCAR and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on PROSCAR was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2-4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive PROSCAR 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of PROSCAR 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long-Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2: Incidence >=2% in One or More Treatment Groups Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS Adverse Experience Placebo (N=737) (%) Doxazosin 4 mg or 8 mgDoxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg).

Men received either PROSCAR (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with PROSCAR. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with PROSCAR. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with PROSCAR. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: -hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) -testicular pain -sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking PROSCAR for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of PROSCAR in these events is unknown. -male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking PROSCAR for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of PROSCAR in these events is unknown. -depression -male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: -orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS PROSCAR reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on PROSCAR may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). PROSCAR may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken PROSCAR tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). PROSCAR is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with PROSCAR for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, PROSCAR reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking PROSCAR, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on PROSCAR may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with PROSCAR therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with PROSCAR for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with PROSCAR. PROSCAR may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of PROSCAR. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken PROSCAR tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. PROSCAR tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women PROSCAR is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with PROSCAR for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with PROSCAR, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

Clinical Studies for Finasteride 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for finasteride of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking finasteride (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for Finasteride 5 mg and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the finasteride 5 mg long-term efficacy and safety study, a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on finasteride 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride 5 mg was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride 5 mg but no cases in men not treated with finasteride 5 mg. During the 4-year placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride 5 mg. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride 5 mg, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride 5 mg. Finasteride 5 mg is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction: hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face); Reproductive System : sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1, 16). Finasteride causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus Finasteride is not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride, 1 mg in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride, 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride 5 mg showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5 alpha-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs. placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with Finasteride tablets and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cipla Limited, India at 1- 866 -604 -3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for Finasteride tablets, 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for Finasteride tablets of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking Finasteride tablets (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with Finasteride tablets or placebo are presented in Table 1. Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with Finasteride tablets, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with Finasteride tablets due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with Finasteride tablets. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of Finasteride tablets (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with Finasteride tablets, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for PROSCAR(R) (finasteride 5 mg) and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the PROSCAR Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on PROSCAR 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with PROSCAR 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on PROSCAR was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2-4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with PROSCAR 5 mg and PLESS were similar. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with PROSCAR 5mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with PROSCAR but no cases in men not treated with PROSCAR. During the 4-year placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with PROSCAR. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with PROSCAR, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3.0 ng/mL. Men received either PROSCAR (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of Finasteride tablets by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with PROSCAR. PROSCAR is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Finasteride tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction: hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face); Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in greater than or equal to 1% in patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (Long-term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was greater than or equal to 1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. Table 1: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences *Combined Years 2 to 4 N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4* (%) Finasteride Placebo Finasteride Placebo Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 Phase III Studies and 5-Year Open Extensions The adverse experience profile in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies, the 5-year open extensions, and the long-term efficacy and safety study were similar. Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy [see Long-Term Data]. The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2: Incidence >=2% in One or More Treatment Groups Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS Adverse Experience Doxazosin Placebo 4 mg or 8 mgDoxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg). The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8-mg dose over the duration of the study.

Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: -hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) -testicular pain -sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. -male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. -depression -male breast cancer The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: -orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). -Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). -Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). -Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). -Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA less than or equal to 3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride Placebo N=945 N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder(Decreased Volume 1.2 0.7 of Ejaculate) (0.8) (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for Finasteride 5 mg and Dutasteride in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In a long-term efficacy and safety study, a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on finasteride 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. TABLE 2 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride 5 mg BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Year 1 Years 2, 3 and 4* (%) (%) Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo *Combined Years 2 to 4 N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with finasteride 5 mg and a long-term efficacy and safety study were similar. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year placebo-controlled a long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3.0 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Finasteride is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction: hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face; Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Neoplasms: male breast cancer; Breast disorders: breast tenderness and enlargement; Nervous System/Psychiatric: depression"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride is not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients (5.1, 5.4). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1, 16). Finasteride causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Finasteride tablets are not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride, 1 mg in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride, 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy [see Long-Term Data]. The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7­year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) testicular pain sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. depression male breast cancer The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA less than or equal to 3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%) [see Indications and Usage 1.3 ) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for Finasteride Tablets USP 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for finasteride tablets USP of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking finasteride tablets USP (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride tablets USP or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride Tablets USP, 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride tablets USP N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride tablets USP 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride tablets USP due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride tablets USP (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg but no cases in men not treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. During the 4-year placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride tablets USP, 1 mg by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride tablets USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction: hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face); Reproductive System:sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP, when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1),How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride tablets USP 5 mg showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride tablets USP may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5?-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride tablets USP 1 mg) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [ See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in pediatric patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]."

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy [see Long Term Data]. The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2: Incidence >=2% in One or More Treatment Groups Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS * Doxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg). The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin.

The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled a long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-­year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) - testicular pain. - sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g., reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - depression. - male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-­reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs. placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). 5α-­reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) .] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with PROPECIA and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for PROPECIA (finasteride 1 mg) in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for PROPECIA of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking PROPECIA (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with PROPECIA or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for PROPECIA (finasteride 1 mg) in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS PROPECIA N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with PROPECIA, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with PROPECIA due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with PROPECIA. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of PROPECIA (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with PROPECIA, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for PROSCAR(R) (finasteride 5 mg) and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the PROSCAR Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on PROSCAR 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with PROSCAR 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on PROSCAR was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2-4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. TABLE 2 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for PROSCAR (finasteride 5 mg) BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4 (%) Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with PROSCAR 5 mg and PLESS were similar. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with PROSCAR 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with PROSCAR but no cases in men not treated with PROSCAR. During the 4-year placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with PROSCAR. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with PROSCAR, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3.0 ng/mL. Men received either PROSCAR (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of PROPECIA by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with PROSCAR. PROSCAR is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of PROPECIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction : hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face; Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS PROPECIA is not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients (5.1, 5.4). Women should not handle crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1, 16). PROPECIA causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on PROPECIA may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus PROPECIA is not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. PROPECIA tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with PROPECIA (finasteride, 1 mg) in men 18-41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with PROSCAR (finasteride, 5 mg) when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with PROSCAR showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on PROPECIA may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with PROPECIA may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of PROPECIA) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients PROPECIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride tablets 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride tablets 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [see Clinical Studies (14.2) .] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [see Long Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

Long-Term Data High-Grade Prostate Cancer The PCPT trial was a 7 year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <= 3 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage ( 1.3) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2) ]. In a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4 to 6year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4 year, placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7 year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride and/or finasteride at lower doses. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain - erectile dysfunction (ED) that continued after discontinuation of treatment, reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions with a known association to ED. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality have been reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. Normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. - depression - decreased libido that continued after discontinuation of treatment - male breast cancer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5αreductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride tablets may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride tablets 5 mg/day in the 7 year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) .] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride tablets 1 mg and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for Finasteride Tablets 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for finasteride tablets 1 mg of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking finasteride tablets 1 mg (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride tablets 1 mg or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for finasteride tablets 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride tablets 1 mg N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride tablets 1 mg, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride tablets 1 mg due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride tablets 1 mg. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride tablets 1 mg (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride tablets 1 mg, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for Finasteride Tablets 5 mg and AVODART* (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the finasteride tablets 5 mg long-term efficacy and safety study, a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3,040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1,524 on finasteride tablets 5 mg/day and 1,516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets 5 mg was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3,047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg but no cases in men not treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg. During the 4-year placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3,040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART* (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride tablets 1 mg by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg. Finasteride tablets 5 mg is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride tablets 1 mg. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction: hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face); Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride tablets 1 mg are not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients (5.1, 5.4). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets 1 mg when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1, 16). Finasteride tablets 1 mg cause a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride tablets 1 mg may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus Finasteride tablets 1 mg are not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets 1 mg when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets 1 mg are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride tablets 1 mg in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride tablets 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride tablets 5 mg showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets 1 mg may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride tablets 1 mg may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5alpha-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride tablets 1 mg) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART*) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients Finasteride tablets 1 mg are not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]."

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >= 1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n = 768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n = 756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n = 786), or placebo (n = 737) for 4 to 6 years [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >= 2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2 ). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy [see Long-Term Data]. The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2: Incidence >= 2% in One or More Treatment Groups Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS Adverse Experience Placebo Doxazosin 4 mg or 8 mgDoxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg).

Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Breast Cancer During the 4 to 6 year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4 year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7 year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain - sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g., reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions with a known association to ED. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality have been reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <= 3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7 year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%) [see Indications and Usage ( 1.3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Similar results were observed in a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART(R)) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in >=1% in patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash ( 6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (a Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. Table 1: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4 Combined Years 2 to 4 (%) Finasteride Placebo Finasteride Placebo N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 Phase III Studies and 5-Year Open Extensions The adverse experience profile in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies, the 5-year open extensions, and a long-term efficacy and safety study were similar. Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long-Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2: Incidence >=2% in One or More Treatment Groups: Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS Adverse Experience Placebo (N=737) (%) Doxazosin 4 mg or 8 mg Doxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg). The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8-mg dose over the duration of the study.

Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4 to 6-year placebo and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) testicular pain sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. depression male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on Finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor ( 5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer ( 5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus ( 5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women ( 5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms ( 5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) .] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ] . 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with PROPECIA and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for PROPECIA (finasteride 1 mg) in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for PROPECIA of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking PROPECIA (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with PROPECIA or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for PROPECIA (finasteride 1 mg) in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS PROPECIA N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with PROPECIA, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with PROPECIA due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with PROPECIA. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of PROPECIA (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with PROPECIA, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for PROSCAR(R) (finasteride 5 mg) and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the PROSCAR Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on PROSCAR 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with PROSCAR 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on PROSCAR was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2-4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. TABLE 2 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for PROSCAR (finasteride 5 mg) BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4Combined Years 2-4 (%) Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with PROSCAR 5 mg and PLESS were similar. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with PROSCAR 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with PROSCAR but no cases in men not treated with PROSCAR. During the 4-year placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with PROSCAR. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with PROSCAR, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3.0 ng/mL. Men received either PROSCAR (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of PROPECIA by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with PROSCAR. PROSCAR is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of PROPECIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction : hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face; Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Neoplasms: male breast cancer; Breast disorders: breast tenderness and enlargement; Nervous System/Psychiatric: depression"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS PROPECIA is not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients (5.1, 5.4). Women should not handle crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1, 16). PROPECIA causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on PROPECIA may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus PROPECIA is not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken PROPECIA tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. PROPECIA tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with PROPECIA (finasteride, 1 mg) in men 18-41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with PROSCAR (finasteride, 5 mg) when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with PROSCAR showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on PROPECIA may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with PROPECIA may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of PROPECIA) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients PROPECIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Finasteride tablets USP are generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8-mg dose over the duration of the study. Long-Term Data High-Grade Prostate Cancer The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <= 3.0 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 7year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride tablets USP and/or finasteride at lower doses. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain - erectile dysfunction (ED) that continued after discontinuation of treatment, reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP forthe treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions with a known association to ED. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality have been reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP for the treatment of BPH. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. Normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. - depression - decreased libido that continued after discontinuation of treatment - male breast cancer."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS In clinical studies, finasteride tablets USP reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride tablets USP, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride tablets USP therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP. Finasteride tablets USP may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets USP. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5αreductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] Finasteride tablets USP is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. Treatment with finasteride tablets USP for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets USP, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART(R)*), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3,047 men, there were four cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3,040 men, there were two cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was one case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and one case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) - testicular pain - sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - depression - male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). -Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). -Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). -Finasteride tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). -Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within 6 months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least 6 months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for 6 months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <= 3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs. placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART(R)*) (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in >= 1% in patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4 year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4 Year Placebo-Controlled Study (A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >= 1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n = 768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n = 756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n = 786), or placebo (n = 737) for 4 to 6 years [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >= 2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2 ). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy [see Long-Term Data]. The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2: Incidence >= 2% in One or More Treatment Groups Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS Adverse Experience Placebo Doxazosin 4 mg or 8 mgDoxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg).

However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment.

The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 7year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride tablets USP. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: -hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) -testicular pain -sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. -male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. -depression -male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride tablets USP reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride tablets USP may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets USP for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride tablets USP reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride tablets USP, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride tablets USP therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP. Finasteride tablets USP may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets USP. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5αreductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride tablets USP is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride tablets USP for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets USP, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in >=1% in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride tablets USP are generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8-mg dose over the duration of the study. Long-Term Data High-Grade Prostate Cancer The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <= 3.0 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3)and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride tablets USP. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) - testicular pain - sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g reduced ejaculate volume).

The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8-mg dose over the duration of the study. Long-Term Data High-Grade Prostate Cancer The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <= 3.0 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 7year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride tablets USP and/or finasteride at lower doses. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain - erectile dysfunction (ED) that continued after discontinuation of treatment, reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP forthe treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions with a known association to ED. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality have been reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP for the treatment of BPH. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. Normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. - depression - decreased libido that continued after discontinuation of treatment - male breast cancer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride tablets USP reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride tablets USP may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride tablets USP are not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets USP for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride tablets USP reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride tablets USP, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride tablets USP therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP. Finasteride tablets USP may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets USP. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5αreductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets USP when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride tablets USP is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride tablets USP for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets USP, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for Finasteride Tablets USP 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for finasteride tablets USP of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking finasteride tablets USP (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride tablets USP or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride Tablets USP, 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride tablets USP N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride tablets USP 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride tablets USP due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride tablets USP (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg but no cases in men not treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. During the 4-year placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride tablets USP, 1 mg by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride tablets USP.

[See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1),How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] In clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride tablets USP 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride tablets USP 5 mg showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets USP may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride tablets USP may also affect PSA test results. Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride tablets USP 1 mg) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%).

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (a Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long-Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2: Incidence >=2% in One or More Treatment Groups: Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS Adverse Experience Placebo (N=737) (%) Doxazosin 4 mg or 8 mg Doxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg).

Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4 to 6-year placebo and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) testicular pain sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on Finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor ( 5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer ( 5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus ( 5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women ( 5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms ( 5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) .] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ] . 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in >=1% in patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride tablets USP are generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride tablets USP and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8-mg dose over the duration of the study. Long-Term Data High-Grade Prostate Cancer The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <= 3.0 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets USP. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 7year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets USP. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience with finasteride tablets USP and/or finasteride at lower doses. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain - erectile dysfunction (ED) that continued after discontinuation of treatment, reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP forthe treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions with a known association to ED. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality have been reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets USP for the treatment of BPH. The independent role of finasteride tablets USP in these events is unknown. Normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. - depression - decreased libido that continued after discontinuation of treatment - male breast cancer."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2-4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Long-Term Data There is no evidence of increased adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During a 4- to 6-year placebo and comparator controlled study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled a long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. In a 7-year placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men, 9060 had prostate needle biopsy data available for analysis. In the finasteride group, 280 (6.4%) men had prostate cancer with Gleason scores of 7-10 detected on needle biopsy vs. 237 (5.1%) men in the placebo group. Of the total cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in this study, approximately 98% were classified as intracapsular (stage T1 or T2). The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. This information from the literature (Thompson IM, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, et al. The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349:213-22) is provided for consideration by physicians when finasteride is used as indicated (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Finasteride is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse effects have been reported in post-marketing experience: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face - testicular pain."

Finasteride does not appear to affect the cytochrome P450-linked drug-metabolizing enzyme system. Compounds that have been tested in man include antipyrine, digoxin, propranolol, theophylline, and warfarin and no clinically meaningful interactions were found. 7.2 Other Concomitant Therapy Although specific interaction studies were not performed, finasteride doses of 1 mg or more were concomitantly used in clinical studies with acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, α-blockers, analgesics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers, cardiac nitrates, diuretics, H 2 antagonists, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (also referred to as NSAIDs), and quinolone anti-infectives without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder ( 6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for Finasteride 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for finasteride of 12-month duration, 1.4% of patients taking finasteride (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride 1 mg N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo . Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for Finasteride 5 mg and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the Finasteride 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study, a 4-year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on finasteride 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride 5 mg was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. TABLE 2: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride 5 mg BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4 Combined Years 2 to 4 (%) Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo Finasteride, 5 mg Placebo N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 The adverse experience profiles in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III BPH studies and the 5-year open extensions with finasteride 5 mg and Finasteride 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study were similar. There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride 5 mg but no cases in men not treated with finasteride 5 mg. During the 4-year placebo-controlled Finasteride 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride 5 mg. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride 5 mg, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3.0 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride 1 mg by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride 5 mg. Finasteride 5 mg is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction : hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face); Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride is not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients ( 5.1, 5.4). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus ( 5.1, 8.1, 16). Finasteride causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor ( 5.2). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer ( 5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Finasteride is not indicated for use in women. Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1).] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride, 1 mg in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride, 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride, 5 mg showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride 1 mg may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride 1 mg may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride 1 mg) in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1). ] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] ."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in >=1% in patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (a Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder. Table 1: Drug-Related Adverse Experiences Year 1 (%) Years 2, 3 and 4 Combined Years 2 to 4 (%) Finasteride Placebo Finasteride Placebo N = 1524 and 1516, finasteride vs placebo, respectively Impotence 8.1 3.7 5.1 5.1 Decreased Libido 6.4 3.4 2.6 2.6 Decreased Volume of Ejaculate 3.7 0.8 1.5 0.5 Ejaculation Disorder 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 Breast Enlargement 0.5 0.1 1.8 1.1 Breast Tenderness 0.4 0.1 0.7 0.3 Rash 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.1 Phase III Studies and 5-Year Open Extensions The adverse experience profile in the 1-year, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies, the 5-year open extensions, and a long-term efficacy and safety study were similar. Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long-Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2: Incidence >=2% in One or More Treatment Groups: Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS Adverse Experience Placebo (N=737) (%) Doxazosin 4 mg or 8 mg Doxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg). The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8-mg dose over the duration of the study.

Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4 to 6-year placebo and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: -hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) -testicular pain -sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. -male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. -depression -male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: -orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on Finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). -Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). -Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). -Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). -Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) .] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in >=1% in patients treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride tablets 5 mg are generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4 Year Placebo-Controlled Study In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1,524 patients treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg and 1,516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets 5 mg were >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3,047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride tablets 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride tablets 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by >=2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long-Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2 Incidence >=2% in One or More Treatment Groups Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS Adverse Experience Placebo (N=737) (%) Doxazosin 4 mg or 8 mgDoxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg). The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8 mg dose over the duration of the study.

Men received either finasteride tablets 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART*), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg. Breast Cancer During the 4 to 6 year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3,047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4 year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3,040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7­ year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride tablets 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride tablets 5 mg. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: -hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) -testicular pain -sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets 5 mg for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride tablets 5 mg in these events is unknown. -male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride tablets 5 mg for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride tablets 5 mg in these events is unknown. -depression -male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: -orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride tablets 5 mg reduce serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride tablets 5 mg may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride tablets 5 mg may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets 5 mg when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride tablets 5 mg are not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets 5 mg for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride tablets 5 mg reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride tablets 5 mg, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets 5 mg may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α­-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride tablets 5 mg therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets 5 mg. Finasteride tablets 5 mg may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets 5 mg. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7 year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART*) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-­reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women- Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets 5 mg when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets 5 mg are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride tablets 5 mg are not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride tablets 5 mg for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride tablets 5 mg, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo are: decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Clinical Studies for Finasteride 1 mg in the Treatment of Male Pattern Hair Loss In three controlled clinical trials for finasteride of 12 month duration, 1.4% of patients taking finasteride (n=945) were discontinued due to adverse experiences that were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely drug-related (1.6% for placebo; n=934). Clinical adverse experiences that were reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in >=1% of patients treated with finasteride or placebo are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 Drug-Related Adverse Experiences for Finasteride 1 mg in Year 1 (%) MALE PATTERN HAIR LOSS Finasteride 1 mg N=945 Placebo N=934 Decreased Libido 1.8 1.3 Erectile Dysfunction 1.3 0.7 Ejaculation Disorder (Decreased Volume of Ejaculate) 1.2 (0.8) 0.7 (0.4) Discontinuation due to drug-related sexual adverse experiences 1.2 0.9 Integrated analysis of clinical adverse experiences showed that during treatment with finasteride, 36 (3.8%) of 945 men had reported one or more of these adverse experiences as compared to 20 (2.1%) of 934 men treated with placebo (p=0.04). Resolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with finasteride due to these side effects and in most of those who continued therapy. The incidence of each of the above adverse experiences decreased to <=0.3% by the fifth year of treatment with finasteride. In a study of finasteride 1 mg daily in healthy men, a median decrease in ejaculate volume of 0.3 mL (-11%) compared with 0.2 mL (-8%) for placebo was observed after 48 weeks of treatment. Two other studies showed that finasteride at 5 times the dosage of finasteride (5 mg daily) produced significant median decreases of approximately 0.5 mL (-25%) compared to placebo in ejaculate volume, but this was reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In the clinical studies with finasteride, the incidences for breast tenderness and enlargement, hypersensitivity reactions, and testicular pain in finasteride-treated patients were not different from those in patients treated with placebo. Controlled Clinical Trials and Long-Term Open Extension Studies for Finasteride 5 mg and AVODART (dutasteride) in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia In the finasteride 5 mg Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study (PLESS), a 4 year controlled clinical study, 3040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78 with symptomatic BPH and an enlarged prostate were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years (1524 on finasteride 5 mg/day and 1516 on placebo). 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride 5 mg and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 2 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride 5 mg was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride 5 mg. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. During the 4 to 6 year placebo- and comparator-controlled Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride 5 mg but no cases in men not treated with finasteride 5 mg. During the 4 year placebo-controlled PLESS study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men, but no cases were reported in men treated with finasteride 5 mg. During the 7 year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride 5 mg, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. The PCPT trial was a 7 year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,882 healthy men >=55 years of age with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA <=3 ng/mL. Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%). In a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor [AVODART (dutasteride)], similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). The clinical significance of these findings with respect to use of finasteride 1 mg by men is unknown. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride 5 mg. Finasteride 5 mg is not approved to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of finasteride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Hypersensitivity Reaction: hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face; Reproductive System: sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality (normalization or improvement of seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride); testicular pain.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride is not indicated for use in women or pediatric patients (5.1, 5.4). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.1, 8.1, 16). Finasteride causes a decrease in serum PSA levels. Any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.2). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.3, 6.1). 5.1 Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus Finasteride is not indicated for use in women.

Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Indications and Usage (1), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) .] 5.2 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) In clinical studies with finasteride, 1 mg in men 18 to 41 years of age, the mean value of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased from 0.7 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL at Month 12. Further, in clinical studies with finasteride, 5 mg when used in older men who have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), PSA levels are decreased by approximately 50%. Other studies with finasteride, 5 mg showed it may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. These findings should be taken into account for proper interpretation of serum PSA when evaluating men treated with finasteride. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride 1 mg may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance to therapy with finasteride 1 mg may also affect PSA test results. 5.3 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer with 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <= 3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day (5 times the dose of finasteride 1 mg) in the 7 year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Similar results were observed in a 4 year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.4 Pediatric Patients Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Greenstone LLC at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study ( A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study ) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy [see Long Term Data]. The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements.

Men received either finasteride 5 mg or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4- to 6-year placebo- and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled a long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-­year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, urticaria, and swelling of the lips and face. - testicular pain. - sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g., reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. - depression. - male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: - orgasm disorders"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5.1). Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer (5.2, 6.1). Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus (5.3, 8.1, 16). Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women (5.4, 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, 12.3). Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms (5.6). 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-­reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA <=3 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs. placebo 1.1%). [See Indications and Usage (1.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1).] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs. 0.5% placebo). 5α-­reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. 5.3 Exposure of Women - Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed. [See Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] 5.4 Pediatric Patients and Women Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] or women [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.5 Effect on Semen Characteristics Treatment with finasteride for 24 weeks to evaluate semen parameters in healthy male volunteers revealed no clinically meaningful effects on sperm concentration, mobility, morphology, or pH. A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy."

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride tablets USP and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride tablets USP was >=1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.
