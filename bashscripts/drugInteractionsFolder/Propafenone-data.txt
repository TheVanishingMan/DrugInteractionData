        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 may increase propafenone levels which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Simultaneous use with both a CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor (or in a patient with CYP2D6 deficiency) should be avoided. ( 7.1) • Propafenone may increase warfarin or digoxin levels. ( 7.2, 7.3) • Concomitant use of lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. ( 7.3) • Orlistat may reduce propafenone concentrations. Abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stable on propafenone has resulted in convulsions, atrioventricular block, and circulatory failure. ( 7.5) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of propafenone ER capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. Amiodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39 and 50% and the R propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71 and 50%. Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 )]. Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg three times daily) with 150 mg immediate release propafenone three times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in EM, making them PM. Steady state plasma concentrations increased by more than 2-fold for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone A 100 mg dose of quinidine increased steady state concentrations of propafenone 3-fold. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentration of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In poor metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and increased the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74 and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5OH-propafenone by 69 and 57%. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60 to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31 to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In post marketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100 to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

The data described below reflect exposure to propafenone ER capsules 225 mg BID in 126 patients, to propafenone ER capsules 325 mg BID in 135 patients, to propafenone ER capsules 425 mg BID in 136 patients, and to placebo in 126 patients for up to 39 weeks (mean 20 weeks) in a placebo‑ controlled trial (RAFT) conducted in the U.S. The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5% and greater than placebo), excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug or because they were associated with the condition being treated, were dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17%, and the rate was highest during the first 14 days of treatment.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. ( 5.1) • Propafenone HCl Extended Release may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. Evaluate patients via ECG after initiation of therapy. (4, 5.2). • Avoid use with other antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs that prolong the QT interval. ( 5.3) • Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. ( 5.2) • May provoke overt heart failure. ( 5.5) • May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Should not be given to patients with conduction defects in absence of a pacemaker. ( 5.6) • May affect artificial pacemakers. Pacemakers should be monitored during therapy. ( 5.7) • Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. ( 5.8) • Administer cautiously to patients with impaired hepatic and renal function. ( 5.9, 5.10) • Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported. ( 5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and Torsade de Pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy, to determine whether the response to propafenone ER capsules supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2)]. In the RAFT study [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)] there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled propafenone ER capsules group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall propafenone ER capsules and propafenone immediate release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label multicenter trial using the immediate release formulation in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the 9 patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, Torsade de Pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone immediate release (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of pro-arrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see BOXED WARNING: MORTALITY] suggests that an increased risk of proarrhythmia is present throughout treatment. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone ER capsules. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone ER capsules (propafenone hydrochloride) in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone ER capsules. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous U se with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone ER capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In the U.S. trial (RAFT) in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving propafenone ER capsules (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. Proarrhythmic effects more likely occur when propafenone is administered to patients with heart failure (NYHA III and IV) or severe myocardial ischemia [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. In clinical trial experience with propafenone immediate release, new or worsened heart failure has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia. These events were more likely in subjects with preexisting heart failure and coronary artery disease. New onset of heart failure attributable to propafenone developed in <0.2% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia and in 1.9% of patients with paroxysmal AF or PSVT. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2)]. In a U.S. trial (RAFT) in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with propafenone ER capsules, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with propafenone ER capsules and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function when given propafenone immediate release tablets. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease administered propafenone immediate release tablets, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. No studies have compared bioavailability of propafenone from propafenone ER capsules in patients with normal and impaired hepatic function. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see OVERDOSAGE (10)] 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone immediate release tablets. No studies have been performed to assess the percentage of metabolites eliminated in the urine following the administration of propafenone ER capsules. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [ see OVERDOSAGE(10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone HCl administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone HCl produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone HCl administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone HCl produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. ( 5.1 ) •Propafenone HCl Extended Release may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. Evaluate patients via ECG after initiation of therapy. ( 4 , 5.2 ). •Avoid use with other antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs that prolong the QT interval. ( 5.3 ) •Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. ( 5.2 ) •May provoke overt heart failure. ( 5.5 ) •May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Should not be given to patients with conduction defects in absence of a pacemaker. ( 5.6 ) •May affect artificial pacemakers. Pacemakers should be monitored during therapy. ( 5.7 ) •Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. ( 5.8 ) •Administer cautiously to patients with impaired hepatic and renal function. ( 5.9 , 5.10 ) •Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and Torsade de Pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy, to determine whether the response to propafenone ER capsules supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2)]. In the RAFT study [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)] there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled propafenone ER capsules group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall propafenone ER capsules and propafenone immediate release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label multicenter trial using the immediate release formulation in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the 9 patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, Torsade de Pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone immediate release (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of pro-arrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see BOXED WARNING: MORTALITY] suggests that an increased risk of proarrhythmia is present throughout treatment. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone ER capsules. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)] . 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone ER capsules (propafenone hydrochloride) in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone ER capsules. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone ER capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In the U.S. trial (RAFT) in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving propafenone ER capsules (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. Proarrhythmic effects more likely occur when propafenone is administered to patients with heart failure (NYHA III and IV) or severe myocardial ischemia [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)] . In clinical trial experience with propafenone immediate release, new or worsened heart failure has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia. These events were more likely in subjects with preexisting heart failure and coronary artery disease. New onset of heart failure attributable to propafenone developed in <0.2% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia and in 1.9% of patients with paroxysmal AF or PSVT. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2)] . In a U.S. trial (RAFT) in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with propafenone ER capsules, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with propafenone ER capsules and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function when given propafenone immediate release tablets. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease administered propafenone immediate release tablets, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. No studies have compared bioavailability of propafenone from propafenone ER capsules in patients with normal and impaired hepatic function. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see OVERDOSAGE (10)] 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone immediate release tablets. No studies have been performed to assess the percentage of metabolites eliminated in the urine following the administration of propafenone ER capsules. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see OVERDOSAGE (10)] . 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone HCl administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone HCl produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone HCl administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone HCl produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 may increase propafenone levels which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Simultaneous use with both a CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor (or in a patient with CYP2D6 deficiency) should be avoided. ( 7.1) • Propafenone may increase warfarin or digoxin levels. ( 7.2, 7.3) • Concomitant use of lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. ( 7.3) • Orlistat may reduce propafenone concentrations. Abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stable on propafenone has resulted in convulsions, atrioventricular block, and circulatory failure. ( 7.5) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of propafenone ER capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5.2) and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. Amiodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39 and 50% and the R propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71 and 50%. Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 )]. Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg three times daily) with 150 mg immediate release propafenone three times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in EM, making them PM. Steady state plasma concentrations increased by more than 2-fold for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone A 100 mg dose of quinidine increased steady state concentrations of propafenone 3-fold. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentration of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In poor metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and increased the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74 and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5OH-propafenone by 69 and 57%. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60 to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31 to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In post marketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100 to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5% and greater than placebo) excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug included the following: dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. ( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical Inc. at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to propafenone ER capsules 225 mg BID in 126 patients, to propafenone ER capsules 325 mg BID in 135 patients, to propafenone ER capsules 425 mg BID in 136 patients, and to placebo in 126 patients for up to 39 weeks (mean 20 weeks) in a placebo‑ controlled trial (RAFT) conducted in the U.S. The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5% and greater than placebo), excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug or because they were associated with the condition being treated, were dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17%, and the rate was highest during the first 14 days of treatment. Cardiac-related adverse events occurring in ≥ 2% of the patients in any of the RAFT propafenone ER capsules treatment groups and more common with propafenone than with placebo, excluding those that are common in the population and those not plausibly related to drug therapy, included the following: angina pectoris, atrial flutter, AV block first degree, bradycardia, congestive cardiac failure, cardiac murmur, edema, dyspnea, rales, wheezing, and cardioactive drug level above therapeutic. Propafenone prolongs the PR and QRS intervals in patients with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Prolongation of the QRS interval makes it difficult to interpret the effect of propafenone on the QT interval [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2 )]. Non-cardiac related adverse events occurring in ≥ 2% of the patients in any of the RAFT propafenone ER capsules treatment groups and more common with propafenone than with placebo,excluding those that are common in the population and those not plausibly related to drug therapy, included the following: blurred vision, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, upper respiratory tract infection, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, hematuria, muscle weakness, dizziness (excluding vertigo), headache, taste disturbance, tremor, somnolence, anxiety, depression, ecchymosis. No clinically important differences in incidence of adverse reactions were noted by age or gender. Too few non-Caucasian patients were enrolled to assess adverse events according to race. Adverse events occurring in 2% or more of the patients in any of the ERAFT [see CLINICALSTUDIES ( 14 )] propafenone ER capsules treatment groups and not listed above include the following: bundle branch block left, bundle branch block right, conduction disorders, sinus bradycardia, and hypotension.

During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function when given propafenone immediate release tablets. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease administered propafenone immediate release tablets, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. No studies have compared bioavailability of propafenone from propafenone ER capsules in patients with normal and impaired hepatic function. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see OVERDOSAGE (10)] 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone immediate release tablets. No studies have been performed to assess the percentage of metabolites eliminated in the urine following the administration of propafenone ER capsules. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [ see OVERDOSAGE(10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone HCl administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone HCl produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone HCl administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone HCl produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 increase propafenone exposure. (7.1) Propafenone may increase digoxin or warfarin levels. (7.2, 7.3) Orlistat may reduce propafenone exposure. Taper orlistat withdrawal. (7.4) Lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. (7.6) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, or sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, or grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Dosage and Administration (2)]. A m iodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S-propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39% and 50% and the R propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71% and 50%. Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg three times daily) with 150 mg immediate release propafenone three times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in extensive metabolizers, making them slow metabolizers. Steady-state plasma concentrations more than doubled for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100 mg dose of quinidine tripled steady state concentrations of propafenone. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5-OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In slow metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and increased the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74% and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5-OH-propafenone by 69% and 57%. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady-state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60% to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31% to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In post marketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5%) included: unusual taste, nausea and/or vomiting, dizziness, constipation, headache, fatigue, first degree AV block, and intraventricular conduction delay. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Qualitest Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-444-4011 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions associated with propafenone hydrochloride occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. About 20% of patients treated with propafenone hydrochloride have discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions reported for > 1.5% of 474 SVT patients who received propafenone hydrochloride in U.S. clinical trials are presented in Table 1 by incidence and percent discontinuation, reported to the nearest percent. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported for > 1.5% of SVT Patients Incidence % of Pts. Who (N = 480) Discontinued Unusual Taste 14% 1.3% Nausea and/or Vomiting 11% 2.9% Dizziness 9% 1.7% Constipation 8% 0.2% Headache 6% 0.8% Fatigue 6% 1.5% Blurred Vision 3% 0.6% Weakness 3% 1.3% Dyspnea 2% 1.0% Wide Complex Tachycardia 2% 1.9% CHF 2% 0.6% Bradycardia 2% 0.2% Palpitations 2% 0.2% Tremor 2% 0.4% Anorexia 2% 0.2% Diarrhea 2% 0.4% Ataxia 2% 0.0% In controlled trials in patients with ventricular arrhythmia, the most common reactions reported for propafenone hydrochloride and more frequent than on placebo were unusual taste, dizziness, first degree AV block, intraventricular conduction delay, nausea and/or vomiting, and constipation. Headache was relatively common also, but was not increased compared to placebo. Other reactions reported more frequently than on placebo or comparator and not already reported elsewhere included anxiety, angina, second degree AV block, bundle branch block, loss of balance, congestive heart failure, and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions reported for ≥ 1% of 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients who received propafenone in U.S. clinical trials were evaluated by daily dose. The most common adverse reactions appeared dose-related (but note that most patients spent more time at the larger doses), especially dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, unusual taste, constipation, and blurred vision. Some less common reactions may also have been dose-related such as first degree AV block, congestive heart failure, dyspepsia, and weakness. Other adverse reactions included rash, syncope, chest pain, abdominal pain, ataxia, and hypotension. In addition, the following adverse reactions were reported less frequently than 1% either in clinical trials or in marketing experience. Causality and relationship to propafenone therapy cannot necessarily be judged from these events. Cardiovascular System: Atrial flutter, AV dissociation, cardiac arrest, flushing, hot flashes, sick sinus syndrome, sinus pause or arrest, supraventricular tachycardia. Nervous System: Abnormal dreams, abnormal speech, abnormal vision, confusion, depression, memory loss, numbness, paresthesias, psychosis/mania, seizures (0.3%), tinnitus, unusual smell sensation, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: Cholestasis, elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases), gastroenteritis, hepatitis . Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, anemia, bruising, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Other: Alopecia, eye irritation, impotence, increased glucose, positive ANA (0.7%), muscle cramps, muscle weakness, nephrotic syndrome, pain, pruritus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of propafenone hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: A number of patients with liver abnormalities associated with propafenone therapy have been reported in post-marketing experience. Some appeared due to hepatocellular injury, some were cholestatic and some showed a mixed picture. Some of these reports were simply discovered through clinical chemistries, others because of clinical symptoms including fulminant hepatitis and death. One case was rechallenged with a positive outcome. B lood and Lymphatic System: Increased bleeding time Immune System: lupus erythematosis Nervous System: Apnea, coma Renal and Urinary: Hyponatremia/inappropriate ADH secretion, kidney failure"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. (5.1) Propafenone hydrochloride may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. (4, 5.2) Avoid use with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3) Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. (5.4) May provoke overt heart failure. (5.5) May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Only use in patients with conduction disorders who have pacemakers. (5.6) May affect artificial pacemakers. Monitor pacemaker function. (5.7) Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. (5.8) May exacerbate myasthenia gravis. (5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label, multicenter trial in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the nine patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had a recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrythmia is present throughout treatment. In a study of sustained-release propafenone, there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled sustained-release propafenone group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall sustained-release propafenone and propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone hydrochloride. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone hydrochloride, and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone hydrochloride in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone hydrochloride. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride, new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia; of those 0.9% were considered probably or definitely related to propafenone HCl. Of the patients with CHF probably related to propafenone, 80% had preexisting heart failure and 85% had coronary artery disease. CHF attributable to propafenone HCl developed rarely (< 0.2%) in ventricular arrhythmia patients who had no previous history of CHF. CHF occurred in 1.9% of patients studied with PAF or PSVT. In a U.S. trial of sustained-release propafenone in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving sustained-release propafenone (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The incidence of first degree, second degree, and third degree AV block observed in 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients was 2.5%, 0.6%, and 0.2%, respectively. Development of second or third degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or discontinuation of propafenone HCl. Bundle branch block (1.2%) and intraventricular conduction delay (1.1%) have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Bradycardia has also been reported (1.5%). Experience in patients with sick sinus node syndrome is limited and these patients should not be treated with propafenone. In a U.S. trial in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with sustained-release propafenone, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with sustained-release propafenone and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone hydrochloride. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and, if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone hydrochloride administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 may increase propafenone levels which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Simultaneous use with both a CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor (or in a patient with CYP2D6 deficiency) should be avoided. ( 7.1) Propafenone may increase warfarin or digoxin levels. ( 7.2, 7.3) Orlistat may reduce propafenone concentrations. Abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stable on propafenone has resulted in convulsions, atrioventricular block, and circulatory failure. ( 7.4) Concomitant use of lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. ( 7.6) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of propafenone ER capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2) and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2)] . Amiodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S propafenone C max and AUC by 39 and 50% and the R propafenone C max and AUC by 71 and 50%. Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12)] . Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg three times daily) with 150 mg immediate release propafenone three times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in EM, making them PM. Steady state plasma concentrations increased by more than 2-fold for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone A 100 mg dose of quinidine increased steady state concentrations of propafenone 3-fold. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentration of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In poor metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and increased the AUC and C max of norpropafenone by 74 and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and C max propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and C max of 5OH-propafenone by 69 and 57%. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60 to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31 to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In post marketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100 to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5% and greater than placebo) excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug included the following: dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. ( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical Inc. at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to propafenone ER capsules 225 mg BID in 126 patients, to propafenone ER capsules 325 mg BID in 135 patients, to propafenone ER capsules 425 mg BID in 136 patients, and to placebo in 126 patients for up to 39 weeks (mean 20 weeks) in a placebo‑ controlled trial (RAFT) conducted in the U.S. The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5% and greater than placebo), excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug or because they were associated with the condition being treated, were dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17%, and the rate was highest during the first 14 days of treatment. Cardiac-related adverse events occurring in ≥ 2% of the patients in any of the RAFT propafenone ER capsules treatment groups and more common with propafenone than with placebo, excluding those that are common in the population and those not plausibly related to drug therapy, included the following: angina pectoris, atrial flutter, AV block first degree, bradycardia, congestive cardiac failure, cardiac murmur, edema, dyspnea, rales, wheezing, and cardioactive drug level above therapeutic. Propafenone prolongs the PR and QRS intervals in patients with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Prolongation of the QRS interval makes it difficult to interpret the effect of propafenone on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2)] . Non-cardiac related adverse events occurring in ≥ 2% of the patients in any of the RAFT propafenone ER capsules treatment groups and more common with propafenone than with placebo, excluding those that are common in the population and those not plausibly related to drug therapy, included the following: blurred vision, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, upper respiratory tract infection, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, hematuria, muscle weakness, dizziness (excluding vertigo), headache, taste disturbance, tremor, somnolence, anxiety, depression, ecchymosis. No clinically important differences in incidence of adverse reactions were noted by age or gender. Too few non-Caucasian patients were enrolled to assess adverse events according to race. Adverse events occurring in 2% or more of the patients in any of the ERAFT [see CLINICALSTUDIES ( 14)] propafenone ER capsules treatment groups and not listed above include the following: bundle branch block left, bundle branch block right, conduction disorders, sinus bradycardia, and hypotension. Other adverse events reported with propafenone clinical trials not already listed elsewhere in the prescribing information include the following adverse events by body and preferred term. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Anemia, lymphadenopathy, spleen disorder, thrombocytopenia.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. ( 5.1) Propafenone HCl Extended Release may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. Evaluate patients via ECG after initiation of therapy. ( 4, 5.2). Avoid use with other antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs that prolong the QT interval. ( 5.3) Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. ( 5.2) May provoke overt heart failure. ( 5.5) May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Should not be given to patients with conduction defects in absence of a pacemaker. ( 5.6) May affect artificial pacemakers. Pacemakers should be monitored during therapy. ( 5.7) Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. ( 5.8) Administer cautiously to patients with impaired hepatic and renal function. ( 5.9, 5.10) Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported. ( 5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and Torsade de Pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy, to determine whether the response to propafenone ER capsules supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2) ] . In the RAFT study [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14)] there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled propafenone ER capsules group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall propafenone ER capsules and propafenone immediate release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label multicenter trial using the immediate release formulation in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the 9 patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, Torsade de Pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone immediate release (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of pro-arrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see BOXED WARNING: MORTALITY] suggests that an increased risk of proarrhythmia is present throughout treatment. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone ER capsules. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4)] . 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone ER capsules (propafenone hydrochloride) in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone ER capsules. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous U se with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone ER capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In the U.S. trial (RAFT) in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving propafenone ER capsules (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. Proarrhythmic effects more likely occur when propafenone is administered to patients with heart failure (NYHA III and IV) or severe myocardial ischemia [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4)] . In clinical trial experience with propafenone immediate release, new or worsened heart failure has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia. These events were more likely in subjects with preexisting heart failure and coronary artery disease. New onset of heart failure attributable to propafenone developed in <0.2% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia and in 1.9% of patients with paroxysmal AF or PSVT. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.2)] . In a U.S. trial (RAFT) in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with propafenone ER capsules, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with propafenone ER capsules and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function when given propafenone immediate release tablets. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease administered propafenone immediate release tablets, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. No studies have compared bioavailability of propafenone from propafenone ER capsules in patients with normal and impaired hepatic function. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see OVERDOSAGE ( 10)] 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone immediate release tablets. No studies have been performed to assess the percentage of metabolites eliminated in the urine following the administration of propafenone ER capsules. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [ see OVERDOSAGE ( 10) ] . 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone HCl administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone HCl produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone HCl administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone HCl produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "Drug Interactions Quinidine Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). There is, as yet, too little information to recommend concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Local Anesthetics Concomitant use of local anesthetics (i.e., during pacemaker implantations, surgery, or dental use) may increase the risks of central nervous system side effects. Digitalis Propafenone hydrochloride produces dose-related increases in serum digoxin levels ranging from about 35% at 450 mg/day to 85% at 900 mg/day of propafenone without affecting digoxin renal clearance. These elevations of digoxin levels were maintained for up to 16 months during concomitant administration. Plasma digoxin levels of patients on concomitant therapy should be measured, and digoxin dosage should ordinarily be reduced when propafenone is started, especially if a relatively large digoxin dose is used or if plasma concentrations are relatively high. Beta-Antagonists In a study involving healthy subjects, concomitant administration of propafenone and propranolol has resulted in substantial increases in propranolol plasma concentration and elimination half-life with no change in propafenone plasma levels from control values. Similar observations have been reported with metoprolol. Propafenone appears to inhibit the hydroxylation pathway for the two beta-antagonists (just as quinidine inhibits propafenone metabolism). Increased plasma concentrations of metoprolol could overcome its relative cardioselectivity. In propafenone clinical trials, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. While the therapeutic range for beta-blockers is wide, a reduction in dosage may be necessary during concomitant administration with propafenone. Warfarin In a study of eight healthy subjects receiving propafenone and warfarin concomitantly, mean steady-state warfarin plasma concentrations increased 39% with a corresponding increase in prothrombin times of approximately 25%. It is therefore recommended that prothrombin times be routinely monitored and the dose of warfarin be adjusted if necessary. Cimetidine Concomitant administration of propafenone and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone with no detectable changes in electrocardiographic parameters beyond that measured on propafenone alone. Desipramine Concomitant administration of propafenone and desipramine may result in elevated serum desipramine levels. Both desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, and propafenone are cleared by oxidative pathways of demthylation and hydroxylation carried out by the hepatic P-450 cytochrome. Cyclosporin Propafenone therapy may increase levels of cyclosporin. Theophylline Propafenone may increase theophylline concentration during concomitant therapy with the development of theophylline toxicity. Rifampin Rifampin may accelerate the metabolism and decrease the plasma levels and antiarrhythmic efficacy of propafenone. Other Limited experience with propafenone combined with calcium antagonists and diuretics has been reported without evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 might lead to increased plasma levels of propafenone. When propafenone is administered with inhibitors of these enzymes, the patients should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 increase propafenone exposure. ( ) 7.1 Propafenone may increase digoxin or warfarin levels. ( , ) 7.2 7.3 Orlistat may reduce propafenone exposure. Taper orlistat withdrawal. ( ) 7.4 Lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. ( ) 7.6 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, or sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, or grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see and ]. Warnings and Precautions (5.4) Dosage and Administration (2) Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. A m iodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S-propafenone C and AUC by 39% and 50% and the R propafenone C and AUC by 71% and 50%. Fluoxetine: max max Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers . Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg three times daily) with 150 mg immediate release propafenone three times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in extensive metabolizers, making them slow metabolizers. Steady-state plasma concentrations more than doubled for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100 mg dose of quinidine tripled steady state concentrations of propafenone. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Quinidine: [see ] Clinical Pharmacology (12) Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5-OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In slow metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and increased the AUC and C of norpropafenone by 74% and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and C propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and C of 5-OH-propafenone by 69% and 57%. Rifampin: max max max 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady-state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60% to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31% to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In post marketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

Headache was relatively common also, but was not increased compared to placebo. Other reactions reported more frequently than on placebo or comparator and not already reported elsewhere included anxiety, angina, second degree AV block, bundle branch block, loss of balance, congestive heart failure, and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions reported for ≥ 1% of 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients who received propafenone in U.S. clinical trials were evaluated by daily dose. The most common adverse reactions appeared dose-related (but note that most patients spent more time at the larger doses), especially dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, unusual taste, constipation, and blurred vision. Some less common reactions may also have been dose-related such as first degree AV block, congestive heart failure, dyspepsia, and weakness. Other adverse reactions included rash, syncope, chest pain, abdominal pain, ataxia, and hypotension. In addition, the following adverse reactions were reported less frequently than 1% either in clinical trials or in marketing experience. Causality and relationship to propafenone therapy cannot necessarily be judged from these events. Atrial flutter, AV dissociation, cardiac arrest, flushing, hot flashes, sick sinus syndrome, sinus pause or arrest, supraventricular tachycardia. Cardiovascular System: Abnormal dreams, abnormal speech, abnormal vision, confusion, depression, memory loss, numbness, paresthesias, psychosis/mania, seizures (0.3%), tinnitus, unusual smell sensation, vertigo. Nervous System: Cholestasis, elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases), gastroenteritis, hepatitis . Gastrointestinal: Agranulocytosis, anemia, bruising, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Hematologic: Alopecia, eye irritation, impotence, increased glucose, positive ANA (0.7%), muscle cramps, muscle weakness, nephrotic syndrome, pain, pruritus. Other: 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of propafenone hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. A number of patients with liver abnormalities associated with propafenone therapy have been reported in post-marketing experience. Some appeared due to hepatocellular injury, some were cholestatic and some showed a mixed picture. Some of these reports were simply discovered through clinical chemistries, others because of clinical symptoms including fulminant hepatitis and death. One case was rechallenged with a positive outcome.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. ( ) 5.1 Propafenone hydrochloride may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. ( , ) 4 5.2 Avoid use with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. ( ) 5.3 Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. ( ) 5.4 May provoke overt heart failure. ( ) 5.5 May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Only use in patients with conduction disorders who have pacemakers. ( ) 5.6 May affect artificial pacemakers. Monitor pacemaker function. ( ) 5.7 Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. ( ) 5.8 May exacerbate myasthenia gravis. ( ) 5.11 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see ]. Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label, multicenter trial in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the nine patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had a recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study suggests that an increased risk of proarrythmia is present throughout treatment. [see ] Boxed Warning: Mortality In a study of sustained-release propafenone, there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled sustained-release propafenone group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall sustained-release propafenone and propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone hydrochloride. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone hydrochloride, and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome . [see ] Contraindications (4) 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone hydrochloride in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone hydrochloride. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride, new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia; of those 0.9% were considered probably or definitely related to propafenone HCl. Of the patients with CHF probably related to propafenone, 80% had preexisting heart failure and 85% had coronary artery disease. CHF attributable to propafenone HCl developed rarely (< 0.2%) in ventricular arrhythmia patients who had no previous history of CHF. CHF occurred in 1.9% of patients studied with PAF or PSVT. In a U.S. trial of sustained-release propafenone in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving sustained-release propafenone (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see and ]. Contraindications (4) Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) The incidence of first degree, second degree, and third degree AV block observed in 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients was 2.5%, 0.6%, and 0.2%, respectively. Development of second or third degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or discontinuation of propafenone HCl. Bundle branch block (1.2%) and intraventricular conduction delay (1.1%) have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Bradycardia has also been reported (1.5%). Experience in patients with sick sinus node syndrome is limited and these patients should not be treated with propafenone. In a U.S. trial in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with sustained-release propafenone, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with sustained-release propafenone and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects . [see ] Overdosage (10) 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone hydrochloride. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see ]. Overdosage (10) 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and, if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone hydrochloride administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 increase propafenone exposure. ( 7.1) Propafenone may increase digoxin or warfarin levels. ( 7.2, 7.3) Orlistat may reduce propafenone exposure. Taper orlistat withdrawal. ( 7.4) Lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. ( 7.6) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, or sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, or grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Dosage and Administration (2)]. Amiodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S-propafenone C max and AUC by 39% and 50% and the R propafenone C max and AUC by 71% and 50%. Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] . Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg three times daily) with 150 mg immediate release propafenone three times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in extensive metabolizers, making them slow metabolizers. Steady-state plasma concentrations more than doubled for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100 mg dose of quinidine tripled steady state concentrations of propafenone. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5-OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In slow metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and increased the AUC and C max of norpropafenone by 74% and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and C max propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and C max of 5-OH-propafenone by 69% and 57%. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady-state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60% to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31% to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In post marketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

Adverse reactions associated with propafenone hydrochloride tablets occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. About 20% of patients treated with propafenone hydrochloride tablets have discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions reported for > 1.5% of 474 SVT patients who received propafenone hydrochloride tablets in U.S. clinical trials are presented in Table 1 by incidence and percent discontinuation, reported to the nearest percent.

Headache was relatively common also, but was not increased compared to placebo. Other reactions reported more frequently than on placebo or comparator and not already reported elsewhere included anxiety, angina, second degree AV block, bundle branch block, loss of balance, congestive heart failure, and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions reported for > 1% of 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients who received propafenone in U.S. clinical trials were evaluated by daily dose. The most common adverse reactions appeared dose-related (but note that most patients spent more time at the larger doses), especially dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, unusual taste, constipation, and blurred vision. Some less common reactions may also have been dose-related such as first degree AV block, congestive heart failure, dyspepsia, and weakness. Other adverse reactions included rash, syncope, chest pain, abdominal pain, ataxia, and hypotension. In addition, the following adverse reactions were reported less frequently than 1% either in clinical trials or in marketing experience. Causality and relationship to propafenone therapy cannot necessarily be judged from these events. Cardiovascular System: Atrial flutter, AV dissociation, cardiac arrest, flushing, hot flashes, sick sinus syndrome, sinus pause or arrest, supraventricular tachycardia. Nervous System: Abnormal dreams, abnormal speech, abnormal vision, confusion, depression, memory loss, numbness, paresthesias, psychosis/mania, seizures (0.3%), tinnitus, unusual smell sensation, vertigo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. ( 5.1) Propafenone hydrochloride may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. ( 4, 5.2) Avoid use with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. ( 5.3) Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. ( 5.4) May provoke overt heart failure. ( 5.5) May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Only use in patients with conduction disorders who have pacemakers. ( 5.6) May affect artificial pacemakers. Monitor pacemaker function. ( 5.7) Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. ( 5.8) May exacerbate myasthenia gravis. ( 5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride tablets be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride tablets supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label, multicenter trial in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the nine patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had a recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride tablets (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrythmia is present throughout treatment. In a study of sustained-release propafenone, there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled sustained-release propafenone group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall sustained-release propafenone and propafenone immediate-release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone hydrochloride. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone hydrochloride, and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone hydrochloride tablets. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride, new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia; of those 0.9% were considered probably or definitely related to propafenone HCl. Of the patients with CHF probably related to propafenone, 80% had preexisting heart failure and 85% had coronary artery disease. CHF attributable to propafenone HCl developed rarely (< 0.2%) in ventricular arrhythmia patients who had no previous history of CHF. CHF occurred in 1.9% of patients studied with PAF or PSVT. In a U.S. trial of sustained-release propafenone in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving sustained-release propafenone (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The incidence of first degree, second degree, and third degree AV block observed in 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients was 2.5%, 0.6%, and 0.2%, respectively. Development of second or third degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or discontinuation of propafenone HCl. Bundle branch block (1.2%) and intraventricular conduction delay (1.1%) have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Bradycardia has also been reported (1.5%). Experience in patients with sick sinus node syndrome is limited and these patients should not be treated with propafenone. In a U.S. trial in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with sustained-release propafenone, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with sustained-release propafenone and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)] . 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone hydrochloride. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and, if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone hydrochloride administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 may increase propafenone levels which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Simultaneous use with both a CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor (or in patients with CYP2D6 deficiency) should be avoided. (7.1) •Propafenone may increase digoxin or warfarin levels. (7.2, 7.3) •Orlistat may reduce propafenone concentrations. Abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stable on propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules has resulted in convulsions, atrioventricular block, and circulatory failure. (7.4) •Concomitant use of lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. (7.6) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Dosage and Administration (2)]. Amiodarone Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate-release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39% and 50% and the R propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71% and 50%. Quinidine Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg 3 times daily) with 150 mg immediate-release propafenone 3 times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in extensive metabolizers, making them poor metabolizers. Steady-state plasma concentrations increased by more than 2-fold for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100 mg dose of quinidine increased steady-state concentrations of propafenone 3-fold. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5-OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In poor metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and increased the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74% and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5-OH-propafenone by 69% and 57%. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady-state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60% to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31% to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady-state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In post marketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady-state by 113%. In four patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady-state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate-release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (> 5% and greater than placebo) excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug included the following: dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules 225 mg twice daily in 126 patients, to propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules 325 mg twice daily in 135 patients, to propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules 425 mg twice daily in 136 patients, and to placebo in 126 patients for up to 39 weeks (mean 20 weeks) in a placebo-controlled trial (RAFT) conducted in the U.S. The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (> 5% and greater than placebo), excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug or because they were associated with the condition being treated, were dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17%, and the rate was highest during the first 14 days of treatment. Cardiac-related adverse events occurring in ≥ 2% of the patients in any of the RAFT propafenone extended-release treatment groups and more common with propafenone than with placebo, excluding those that are common in the population and those not plausibly related to drug therapy, included the following: angina pectoris, atrial flutter, AV block first degree, bradycardia, congestive cardiac failure, cardiac murmur, edema, dyspnea, rales, wheezing, and cardioactive drug level above therapeutic. Propafenone prolongs the PR and QRS intervals in patients with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Prolongation of the QRS interval makes it difficult to interpret the effect of propafenone on the QT interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Non-cardiac related adverse events occurring in ≥ 2% of the patients in any of the RAFT propafenone extended-release treatment groups and more common with propafenone than with placebo, excluding those that are common in the population and those not plausibly related to drug therapy, included the following: blurred vision, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, upper respiratory tract infection, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, hematuria, muscle weakness, dizziness (excluding vertigo), headache, taste disturbance, tremor, somnolence, anxiety, depression, ecchymosis.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. (5.1) •Propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. Evaluate patients via ECG after initiation of therapy. (4, 5.2) •Avoid use with other antiarrhythmic agents or drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3) •Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. (5.4) •May provoke overt heart failure. (5.5) •May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Should not be given to patients with conduction defects in absence of a pacemaker. (5.6) •May affect artificial pacemakers. Pacemakers should be monitored during therapy. (5.7) •Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. (5.8) •Administer cautiously to patients with impaired hepatic and renal function. (5.9, 5.10) •Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported. (5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and torsades de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy, to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In the RAFT study [see Clinical Studies (14)], there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were five deaths, three in the pooled propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules group (0.8%) and two in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules and propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release database of eight studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label multicenter trial using the immediate-release formulation in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in four of the nine patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the 9 patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsades de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrhythmia is present throughout treatment. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least five half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In the U.S. trial (RAFT) in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in four (1%) patients receiving propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules (all doses), compared to one (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. Proarrhythmic effects more likely occur when propafenone is administered to patients with heart failure (NYHA III and IV) or severe myocardial ischemia [see Contraindications (4)]. In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release, new or worsened heart failure has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia. These events were more likely in subjects with preexisting heart failure and coronary artery disease. New onset of heart failure attributable to propafenone developed in < 0.2% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia and in 1.9% of patients with paroxysmal AF or PSVT. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a U.S. trial (RAFT) in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules, sinus bradycardia (rate < 50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3% to 40% in patients with normal liver function when given propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release tablets. In eight patients with moderate to severe liver disease administered propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release tablets, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. No studies have compared bioavailability of propafenone from propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules in patients with normal and impaired hepatic function. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release tablets. No studies have been performed to assess the percentage of metabolites eliminated in the urine following the administration of propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. (5.1) Propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. Evaluate patients via ECG after initiation of therapy. (4, 5.2) Avoid use with other antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3) Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. (5.4) May provoke overt heart failure. (5.5) May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Should not be given to patients with conduction defects in absence of a pacemaker. (5.6) May affect artificial pacemakers. Pacemakers should be monitored during therapy. (5.7) Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. (5.8) Administer cautiously to patients with impaired hepatic and renal function. (5.9, 5.10) Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported. (5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy, to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In the RAFT study [see Clinical Studies (14)], there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled propafenone hydrochloride extended-release group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall propafenone hydrochloride extended-release and propafenone hydrochloride immediate release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label multicenter trial using the immediate release formulation in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the 9 patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride immediate release (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrhythmia is present throughout treatment. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In the U.S. trial (RAFT) in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. Proarrhythmic effects more likely occur when propafenone is administered to patients with heart failure (NYHA III and IV) or severe myocardial ischemia [see Contraindications (4)]. In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride immediate release, new or worsened heart failure has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia. These events were more likely in subjects with preexisting heart failure and coronary artery disease. New onset of heart failure attributable to propafenone developed in less than 0.2% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia and in 1.9% of patients with paroxysmal AF or PSVT. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a U.S. trial (RAFT) in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules, sinus bradycardia (rate less than 50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function when given propafenone hydrochloride immediate release tablets. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease administered propafenone hydrochloride immediate release tablets, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. No studies have compared bioavailability of propafenone from propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules in patients with normal and impaired hepatic function. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone hydrochloride immediate release tablets. No studies have been performed to assess the percentage of metabolites eliminated in the urine following the administration of propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules. In patients with impaired renal function monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone hydrochloride administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 increase propafenone exposure. (7.1) Propafenone may increase digoxin or warfarin levels. (7.2, 7.3) Orlistat may reduce propafenone exposure. Taper orlistat withdrawal. (7.4) Lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. (7.6) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, or sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, or grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Dosage and Administration (2)]. Amiodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S-propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39% and 50% and the R propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71% and 50%. Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg three times daily) with 150 mg immediate release propafenone three times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in extensive metabolizers, making them slow metabolizers. Steady-state plasma concentrations more than doubled for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100 mg dose of quinidine tripled steady-state concentrations of propafenone. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5-OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In slow metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and increased the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74% and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5-OH-propafenone by 69% and 57%. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady-state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60% to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31% to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady-state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In post marketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady-state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady-state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5%) included: unusual taste, nausea and/or vomiting, dizziness, constipation, headache, fatigue, first degree AV block, and intraventricular conduction delay. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or drugsafety@sunpharma.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions associated with propafenone hydrochloride tablets occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. About 20% of patients treated with propafenone hydrochloride tablets have discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions reported for > 1.5% of 474 SVT patients who received propafenone hydrochloride tablets in U.S. clinical trials are presented in Table 1 by incidence and percent discontinuation, reported to the nearest percent. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported for > 1.5% of SVT Patients Incidence (N = 480) % of Pts. Who Discontinued Unusual Taste 14% 1.3% Nausea and/or Vomiting 11% 2.9% Dizziness 9% 1.7% Constipation 8% 0.2% Headache 6% 0.8% Fatigue 6% 1.5% Blurred Vision 3% 0.6% Weakness 3% 1.3% Dyspnea 2% 1.0% Wide Complex Tachycardia 2% 1.9% CHF 2% 0.6% Bradycardia 2% 0.2% Palpitations 2% 0.2% Tremor 2% 0.4% Anorexia 2% 0.2% Diarrhea 2% 0.4% Ataxia 2% 0.0% In controlled trials in patients with ventricular arrhythmia, the most common reactions reported for propafenone hydrochloride tablets and more frequent than on placebo were unusual taste, dizziness, first degree AV block, intraventricular conduction delay, nausea and/or vomiting, and constipation. Headache was relatively common also, but was not increased compared to placebo. Other reactions reported more frequently than on placebo or comparator and not already reported elsewhere included anxiety, angina, second degree AV block, bundle branch block, loss of balance, congestive heart failure, and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions reported for ≥ 1% of 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients who received propafenone in U.S. clinical trials were evaluated by daily dose. The most common adverse reactions appeared dose-related (but note that most patients spent more time at the larger doses), especially dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, unusual taste, constipation, and blurred vision. Some less common reactions may also have been dose-related such as first degree AV block, congestive heart failure, dyspepsia, and weakness. Other adverse reactions included rash, syncope, chest pain, abdominal pain, ataxia, and hypotension. In addition, the following adverse reactions were reported less frequently than 1% either in clinical trials or in marketing experience. Causality and relationship to propafenone therapy cannot necessarily be judged from these events. Cardiovascular System: Atrial flutter, AV dissociation, cardiac arrest, flushing, hot flashes, sick sinus syndrome, sinus pause or arrest, supraventricular tachycardia. Nervous System: Abnormal dreams, abnormal speech, abnormal vision, confusion, depression, memory loss, numbness, paresthesias, psychosis/mania, seizures (0.3%), tinnitus, unusual smell sensation, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: Cholestasis, elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases), gastroenteritis, hepatitis. Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, anemia, bruising, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Other: Alopecia, eye irritation, impotence, increased glucose, positive ANA (0.7%), muscle cramps, muscle weakness, nephrotic syndrome, pain, pruritus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: A number of patients with liver abnormalities associated with propafenone therapy have been reported in post-marketing experience. Some appeared due to hepatocellular injury, some were cholestatic and some showed a mixed picture. Some of these reports were simply discovered through clinical chemistries, others because of clinical symptoms including fulminant hepatitis and death. One case was rechallenged with a positive outcome. Blood and Lymphatic System: Increased bleeding time Immune System: lupus erythematosis Nervous System: Apnea, coma Renal and Urinary: Hyponatremia/inappropriate ADH secretion, kidney failure"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. (5.1) Propafenone hydrochloride tablets may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. (4, 5.2) Avoid use with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3) Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. (5.4) May provoke overt heart failure. (5.5) May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Only use in patients with conduction disorders who have pacemakers. (5.6) May affect artificial pacemakers. Monitor pacemaker function. (5.7) Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. (5.8) May exacerbate myasthenia gravis. (5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride tablets be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride tablets supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label, multicenter trial in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the nine patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had a recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients' arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride tablets (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrhythmia is present throughout treatment. In a study of sustained-release propafenone, there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled propafenone hydrochloride tablets sustained-release group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall pooled propafenone hydrochloride tablets sustained-release and propafenone hydrochloride tablets immediate-release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone hydrochloride tablets. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone hydrochloride tablets, and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone hydrochloride tablets. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride tablets, new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia; of those 0.9% were considered probably or definitely related to propafenone HCl. Of the patients with CHF probably related to propafenone, 80% had preexisting heart failure and 85% had coronary artery disease. CHF attributable to propafenone HCl developed rarely (< 0.2%) in ventricular arrhythmia patients who had no previous history of CHF. CHF occurred in 1.9% of patients studied with PAF or PSVT. In a U.S. trial of propafenone hydrochloride tablets sustained-release in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving propafenone hydrochloride tablets sustained-release (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The incidence of first degree, second degree, and third degree AV block observed in 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients was 2.5%, 0.6%, and 0.2%, respectively. Development of second or third degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or discontinuation of propafenone HCl. Bundle branch block (1.2%) and intraventricular conduction delay (1.1%) have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Bradycardia has also been reported (1.5%). Experience in patients with sick sinus node syndrome is limited and these patients should not be treated with propafenone. In a U.S. trial in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with propafenone hydrochloride tablets sustained-release, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with propafenone hydrochloride tablets sustained-release and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone hydrochloride tablets. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and, if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone hydrochloride tablets administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 may increase propafenone levels which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Simultaneous use with both a CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor (or in patients with CYP2D6 deficiency) should be avoided. (7.1) •Propafenone may increase digoxin or warfarin levels. (7.2, 7.3) •Orlistat may reduce propafenone concentrations. Abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stable on RYTHMOL SR has resulted in convulsions, atrioventricular block, and circulatory failure. (7.4) •Concomitant use of lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. (7.6) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of RYTHMOL SR with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Dosage and Administration (2)]. Amiodarone Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate-release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S-propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39% and 50%, respectively, and the R propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71% and 50%, respectively. Quinidine Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg 3 times daily) with 150-mg immediate-release propafenone 3 times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in extensive metabolizers, making them poor metabolizers. Steady-state plasma concentrations increased by more than 2 fold for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100-mg dose of quinidine increased steady state concentrations of propafenone 3 fold. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5-OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In poor metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and an increase in the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74% and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5-OH-propafenone by 69% and 57%, respectively. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady-state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60% to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31% to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In postmarketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block, and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate-release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5% and greater than placebo) excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug included the following: dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to RYTHMOL SR 225 mg twice daily in 126 patients, to RYTHMOL SR 325 mg twice daily in 135 patients, to RYTHMOL SR 425 mg twice daily in 136 patients, and to placebo in 126 patients for up to 39 weeks (mean 20 weeks) in a placebo-controlled trial (RAFT) conducted in the US. The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5% and greater than placebo) excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug or because they were associated with the condition being treated, were dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17%, and the rate was highest during the first 14 days of treatment. Cardiac-related adverse events occurring in ≥ 2% of the patients in any of the RAFT propafenone SR treatment groups and more common with propafenone than with placebo, excluding those that are common in the population and those not plausibly related to drug therapy, included the following: angina pectoris, atrial flutter, AV block first-degree, bradycardia, congestive cardiac failure, cardiac murmur, edema, dyspnea, rales, wheezing, and cardioactive drug level above therapeutic. Propafenone prolongs the PR and QRS intervals in patients with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Prolongation of the QRS interval makes it difficult to interpret the effect of propafenone on the QT interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Non-cardiac related adverse events occurring in ≥2% of the patients in any of the RAFT propafenone SR treatment groups and more common with propafenone than with placebo, excluding those that are common in the population and those not plausibly related to drug therapy, included the following: blurred vision, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, upper respiratory tract infection, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, hematuria, muscle weakness, dizziness (excluding vertigo), headache, taste disturbance, tremor, somnolence, anxiety, depression, ecchymosis. No clinically important differences in incidence of adverse reactions were noted by age or gender. Too few non-Caucasian patients were enrolled to assess adverse events according to race. Adverse events occurring in 2% or more of the patients in any of the ERAFT [see Clinical Studies (14)] propafenone SR treatment groups and not listed above include the following: bundle branch block left, bundle branch block right, conduction disorders, sinus bradycardia, and hypotension.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. (5.1) •RYTHMOL SR may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. Evaluate patients via ECG after initiation of therapy. (4, 5.2) •Avoid use with other antiarrhythmic agents or drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3) •Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. (5.4) •May provoke overt heart failure. (5.5) •May cause dose-related first-degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Should not be given to patients with conduction defects in absence of a pacemaker. (5.6) •May affect artificial pacemakers. Pacemakers should be monitored during therapy. (5.7) •Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. (5.8) •Administer cautiously to patients with impaired hepatic and renal function. (5.9, 5.10) •Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported. (5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given RYTHMOL SR be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to RYTHMOL SR supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In the RAFT trial [see Clinical Studies (14)], there were too few deaths to assess the long-term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled group for RYTHMOL SR (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall database of 8 trials of RYTHMOL SR and immediate-release RYTHMOL, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. In a US uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter trial using the immediate-release formulation in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the trial. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the 9 patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had recurrence of SVT during the trial which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsades de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with RYTHMOL immediate-release (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST trial [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrythmia is present throughout treatment. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to RYTHMOL SR. Perform an ECG after initiation of RYTHMOL SR and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Use With Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of RYTHMOL SR in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with RYTHMOL SR. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use With Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the US population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of RYTHMOL SR with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients With a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In the US trial (RAFT) in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving RYTHMOL SR (all doses), compared with 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. Proarrhythmic effects more likely occur when propafenone is administered to patients with heart failure (NYHA III and IV) or severe myocardial ischemia [see Contraindications (4)]. In clinical trial experience with RYTHMOL immediate-release, new or worsened heart failure has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia. These events were more likely in subjects with pre-existing heart failure and coronary artery disease. New onset of heart failure attributable to propafenone developed in <0.2% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia and in 1.9% of patients with paroxysmal AF or PSVT. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first-degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a US trial (RAFT) in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with RYTHMOL SR, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with RYTHMOL SR and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy; the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients With Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared with 3% to 40% in patients with normal liver function when given RYTHMOL immediate-release tablets. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease administered RYTHMOL immediate-release tablets, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. No trials have compared bioavailability of propafenone from RYTHMOL SR in patients with normal and impaired hepatic function. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.10 Use in Patients With Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of RYTHMOL immediate-release tablets. No trials have been performed to assess the percentage of metabolites eliminated in the urine following the administration of RYTHMOL SR Capsules. In patients with impaired renal function monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients With Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs, and rabbits after high-dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term administration of RYTHMOL on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

Adverse reactions associated with propafenone hydrochloride tablets occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. About 20% of patients treated with propafenone hydrochloride tablets have discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions reported for > 1.5% of 474 SVT patients who received propafenone hydrochloride tablets in U.S. clinical trials are presented in Table 1 by incidence and percent discontinuation, reported to the nearest percent. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported for > 1.5% of SVT Patients Incidence (N = 480) % of Pts.

Headache was relatively common also, but was not increased compared to placebo. Other reactions reported more frequently than on placebo or comparator and not already reported elsewhere included anxiety, angina, second degree AV block, bundle branch block, loss of balance, congestive heart failure, and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions reported for ≥ 1% of 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients who received propafenone in U.S. clinical trials were evaluated by daily dose. The most common adverse reactions appeared dose-related (but note that most patients spent more time at the larger doses), especially dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, unusual taste, constipation, and blurred vision. Some less common reactions may also have been dose-related such as first degree AV block, congestive heart failure, dyspepsia, and weakness. Other adverse reactions included rash, syncope, chest pain, abdominal pain, ataxia, and hypotension. In addition, the following adverse reactions were reported less frequently than 1% either in clinical trials or in marketing experience. Causality and relationship to propafenone therapy cannot necessarily be judged from these events. Cardiovascular System: Atrial flutter, AV dissociation, cardiac arrest, flushing, hot flashes, sick sinus syndrome, sinus pause or arrest, supraventricular tachycardia. Nervous System: Abnormal dreams, abnormal speech, abnormal vision, confusion, depression, memory loss, numbness, paresthesias, psychosis/mania, seizures (0.3%), tinnitus, unusual smell sensation, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: Cholestasis, elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases), gastroenteritis, hepatitis. Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, anemia, bruising, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Other: Alopecia, eye irritation, impotence, increased glucose, positive ANA (0.7%), muscle cramps, muscle weakness, nephrotic syndrome, pain, pruritus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: A number of patients with liver abnormalities associated with propafenone therapy have been reported in post-marketing experience. Some appeared due to hepatocellular injury, some were cholestatic and some showed a mixed picture. Some of these reports were simply discovered through clinical chemistries, others because of clinical symptoms including fulminant hepatitis and death. One case was rechallenged with a positive outcome. Blood and Lymphatic System: Increased bleeding time Immune System: lupus erythematosis Nervous System: Apnea, coma Renal and Urinary: Hyponatremia/inappropriate ADH secretion, kidney failure"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. (5.1) •Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. (4, 5.2) •Avoid use with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3) •Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. (5.4) •May provoke overt heart failure. (5.5) •May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Only use in patients with conduction disorders who have pacemakers. (5.6) •May affect artificial pacemakers. Monitor pacemaker function. (5.7) •Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. (5.8) •May exacerbate myasthenia gravis. (5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride tablets be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride tablets support continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label, multicenter trial in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the nine patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had a recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride tablets (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see Boxed Warning: Mortality ] suggests that an increased risk of proarrythmia is present throughout treatment. In a study of sustained-release propafenone, there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled sustained-release propafenone group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall sustained-release propafenone and propafenone immediate-release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone hydrochloride tablets. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone hydrochloride tablets, and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone hydrochloride tablets. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride tablets, new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia; of those 0.9% were considered probably or definitely related to propafenone hydrochloride. Of the patients with CHF probably related to propafenone, 80% had preexisting heart failure and 85% had coronary artery disease. CHF attributable to propafenone hydrochloride developed rarely (< 0.2%) in ventricular arrhythmia patients who had no previous history of CHF. CHF occurred in 1.9% of patients studied with PAF or PSVT. In a U.S. trial of sustained-release propafenone in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving sustained-release propafenone (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The incidence of first degree, second degree, and third degree AV block observed in 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients was 2.5%, 0.6%, and 0.2%, respectively. Development of second or third degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or discontinuation of propafenone hydrochloride. Bundle branch block (1.2%) and intraventricular conduction delay (1.1%) have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Bradycardia has also been reported (1.5%). Experience in patients with sick sinus node syndrome is limited and these patients should not be treated with propafenone. In a U.S. trial in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with sustained-release propafenone, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with sustained-release propafenone and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone hydrochloride tablets. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and, if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone hydrochloride tablets administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 increase propafenone exposure. (7.1) •Propafenone may increase digoxin or warfarin levels. (7.2, 7.3) •Orlistat may reduce propafenone exposure. Taper orlistat withdrawal. (7.4) •Lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. (7.6) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, or sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, or grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of RYTHMOL with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Dosage and Administration (2)]. Amiodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate-release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S-propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39% and 50%, respectively, and the R propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71% and 50%, respectively. Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg 3 times daily) with 150 mg immediate-release propafenone 3 times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in extensive metabolizers, making them slow metabolizers. Steady-state plasma concentrations more than doubled for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100-mg dose of quinidine tripled steady-state concentrations of propafenone. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5-OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In slow metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and an increase in the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74% and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax of propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5-OH‑propafenone by 69% and 57%, respectively. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady-state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60% to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31% to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In postmarketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block, and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate-release tablets, subjects who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5%) included: unusual taste, nausea and/or vomiting, dizziness, constipation, headache, fatigue, first-degree AV block, and intraventricular conduction delay. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions associated with RYTHMOL occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. About 20% of subjects treated with RYTHMOL have discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions reported for > 1.5% of 474 subjects with SVT who received RYTHMOL in US clinical trials are presented in Table 1 by incidence and percent discontinuation, reported to the nearest percent. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported for >1.5% of Subjects With SVT Incidence (N = 480) % of Subjects Who Discontinued Unusual taste 14% 1.3% Nausea and/or vomiting 11% 2.9% Dizziness 9% 1.7% Constipation 8% 0.2% Headache 6% 0.8% Fatigue 6% 1.5% Blurred Vision 3% 0.6% Weakness 3% 1.3% Dyspnea 2% 1.0% Wide complex tachycardia 2% 1.9% CHF 2% 0.6% Bradycardia 2% 0.2% Palpitations 2% 0.2% Tremor 2% 0.4% Anorexia 2% 0.2% Diarrhea 2% 0.4% Ataxia 2% 0.0% In controlled trials in subjects with ventricular arrhythmia, the most common reactions reported for RYTHMOL and more frequent than on placebo were unusual taste, dizziness, first degree AV block, intraventricular conduction delay, nausea and/or vomiting, and constipation. Headache was relatively common also, but was not increased compared with placebo. Other reactions reported more frequently than on placebo or comparator and not already reported elsewhere included anxiety, angina, second-degree AV block, bundle branch block, loss of balance, congestive heart failure, and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions reported for ≥1% of 2,127 subjects with ventricular arrhythmia who received propafenone in US clinical trials were evaluated by daily dose. The most common adverse reactions appeared dose-related (but note that most subjects spent more time at the larger doses), especially dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, unusual taste, constipation, and blurred vision. Some less common reactions may also have been dose-related such as first-degree AV block, congestive heart failure, dyspepsia, and weakness. Other adverse reactions included rash, syncope, chest pain, abdominal pain, ataxia, and hypotension. In addition, the following adverse reactions were reported less frequently than 1% either in clinical trials or in marketing experience. Causality and relationship to propafenone therapy cannot necessarily be judged from these events. Cardiovascular System: Atrial flutter, AV dissociation, cardiac arrest, flushing, hot flashes, sick sinus syndrome, sinus pause or arrest, supraventricular tachycardia. Nervous System: Abnormal dreams, abnormal speech, abnormal vision, confusion, depression, memory loss, numbness, paresthesias, psychosis/mania, seizures (0.3%), tinnitus, unusual smell sensation, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: Cholestasis , elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases), gastroenteritis, hepatitis . Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, anemia, bruising, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Other: Alopecia, eye irritation, impotence, increased glucose, positive ANA (0.7%), muscle cramps, muscle weakness, nephrotic syndrome, pain, pruritus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of RYTHMOL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: A number of patients with liver abnormalities associated with propafenone therapy have been reported in postmarketing experience. Some appeared due to hepatocellular injury, some were cholestatic, and some showed a mixed picture. Some of these reports were simply discovered through clinical chemistries, others because of clinical symptoms including fulminant hepatitis and death. One case was rechallenged with a positive outcome. Blood and Lymphatic System: Increased bleeding time. Immune System: Lupus erythematosis. Nervous System: Apnea, coma. Renal and Urinary: Hyponatremia/inappropriate ADH secretion, kidney failure."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. (5.1) •RYTHMOL may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. (4, 5.2) •Avoid use with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3) •Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. (5.4) •May provoke overt heart failure. (5.5) •May cause dose-related first-degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Only use in patients with conduction disorders who have pacemakers. (5.6) •May affect artificial pacemakers.Monitor pacemaker function. (5.7) •Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. (5.8) •May exacerbate myasthenia gravis. (5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given RYTHMOL be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to RYTHMOL supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a US uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter trial in subjects with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these subjects experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the trial. However, in 4 of the 9 subjects, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the 9 subjects that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all subjects had a recurrence of SVT during the trial which could have been a change in the subjects’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with RYTHMOL (which included subjects treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all subjects had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the subjects who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in subjects with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include subjects with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST trial [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrythmia is present throughout treatment. In a trial of sustained-release propafenone (RYTHMOL SR®), there were too few deaths to assess the long-term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled group for RYTHMOL SR (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall database of 8 trials of RYTHMOL SR and immediate-release RYTHMOL, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to RYTHMOL. Perform an ECG after initiation of RYTHMOL, and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Use With Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of RYTHMOL in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with RYTHMOL. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use With Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the US population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of RYTHMOL with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients With a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta-blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In clinical trial experience with RYTHMOL, new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in 3.7% of subjects with ventricular arrhythmia; of those 0.9% were considered probably or definitely related to propafenone HCl. Of the subjects with CHF probably related to propafenone, 80% had pre-existing heart failure and 85% had coronary artery disease. CHF attributable to propafenone HCl developed rarely (<0.2%) in ventricular arrhythmia subjects who had no previous history of CHF. CHF occurred in 1.9% of subjects studied with PAF or PSVT. In a US trial of RYTHMOL SR in subjects with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) subjects receiving RYTHMOL SR (all doses), compared with 1 (0.8%) subject receiving placebo. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first-degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The incidence of first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree AV block observed in 2,127 subjects with ventricular arrhythmia was 2.5%, 0.6%, and 0.2%, respectively. Development of second- or third-degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or discontinuation of propafenone HCl. Bundle branch block (1.2%) and intraventricular conduction delay (1.1%) have been reported in subjects receiving propafenone. Bradycardia has also been reported (1.5%). Experience in patients with sick sinus node syndrome is limited and these patients should not be treated with propafenone. In a US trial in 523 subjects with a history of symptomatic AF treated with RYTHMOL SR, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with RYTHMOL SR and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy; the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients With Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared with 3% to 40% in patients with normal liver function. In 8 subjects with moderate to severe liver disease, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.10 Use in Patients With Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of RYTHMOL. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients With Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and, if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs, and rabbits after high-dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term administration of RYTHMOL on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "Drug interactions Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). There is, as yet, too little information to recommend concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Local Anesthetics: Concomitant use of local anesthetics (i.e., during pacemaker implantations, surgery, or dental use) may increase the risks of central nervous system side effects. Digitalis: Propafenone HCl produces dose-related increases in serum digoxin levels ranging from about 35% at 450 mg/day to 85% at 900 mg/day of propafenone without affecting digoxin renal clearance. These elevations of digoxin levels were maintained for up to 16 months during concomitant administration. Plasma digoxin levels of patients on concomitant therapy should be measured, and digoxin dosage should ordinarily be reduced when propafenone is started, especially if a relatively large digoxin dose is used or if plasma concentrations are relatively high. Beta-Antagonists: In a study involving healthy subjects, concomitant administration of propafenone and propranolol has resulted in substantial increases in propranolol plasma concentration and elimination half-life with no change in propafenone plasma levels from control values. Similar observations have been reported with metoprolol. Propafenone appears to inhibit the hydroxylation pathway for the two beta-antagonists (just as quinidine inhibits propafenone metabolism). Increased plasma concentrations of metoprolol could overcome its relative cardioselectivity. In propafenone clinical trials, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. While the therapeutic range for beta-blockers is wide, a reduction in dosage may be necessary during concomitant administration with propafenone. Warfarin: In a study of eight healthy subjects receiving propafenone and warfarin concomitantly, mean steady-state warfarin plasma concentrations increased 39% with a corresponding increase in prothrombin times of approximately 25%. It is therefore recommended that prothrombin times be routinely monitored and the dose of warfarin be adjusted if necessary. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone with no detectable changes in electrocardiographic parameters beyond that measured on propafenone alone. Desipramine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and desipramine may result in elevated serum desipramine levels. Both desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, and propafenone are cleared by oxidative pathways of demethylation and hydroxylation carried out by the hepatic P-450 cytochrome. Cyclosporin: Propafenone therapy may increase levels of cyclosporin. Theophylline: Propafenone may increase theophylline concentration during concomitant therapy with the development of theophylline toxicity. Rifampin: Rifampin may accelerate the metabolism and decrease the plasma levels and antiarrhythmic efficacy of propafenone. Other: Limited experience with propafenone combined with calcium antagonists and diuretics has been reported without evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 might lead to increased plasma levels of propafenone. When propafenone is administered with inhibitors of these enzymes, the patients should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 increase propafenone exposure. (7.1) Propafenone may increase digoxin or warfarin levels. (7.2, 7.3) Orlistat may reduce propafenone exposure. Taper orlistat withdrawal. (7.4) Lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. (7.6) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, or sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, or grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Dosage and Administration (2)]. Amiodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S-propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39% and 50% and the R propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71% and 50%. Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg three times daily) with 150 mg immediate release propafenone three times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in extensive metabolizers, making them slow metabolizers. Steady-state plasma concentrations more than doubled for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100 mg dose of quinidine tripled steady state concentrations of propafenone. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5-OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In slow metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and increased the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74% and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5-OH-propafenone by 69% and 57%. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady-state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60% to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31% to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In post marketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

In addition, the following adverse reactions were reported less frequently than 1% either in clinical trials or in marketing experience. Causality and relationship to propafenone therapy cannot necessarily be judged from these events. Cardiovascular System: Atrial flutter, AV dissociation, cardiac arrest, flushing, hot flashes, sick sinus syndrome, sinus pause or arrest, supraventricular tachycardia. Nervous System: Abnormal dreams, abnormal speech, abnormal vision, confusion, depression, memory loss, numbness, paresthesias, psychosis/mania, seizures (0.3%), tinnitus, unusual smell sensation, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: Cholestasis , elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases) , gastroenteritis, hepatitis . Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, anemia, bruising, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Other: Alopecia, eye irritation, impotence, increased glucose, positive ANA (0.7%), muscle cramps, muscle weakness, nephrotic syndrome, pain, pruritus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: A number of patients with liver abnormalities associated with propafenone therapy have been reported in post-marketing experience. Some appeared due to hepatocellular injury, some were cholestatic and some showed a mixed picture. Some of these reports were simply discovered through clinical chemistries, others because of clinical symptoms including fulminant hepatitis and death. One case was rechallenged with a positive outcome. Blood and Lymphatic System: Increased bleeding time Immune System: lupus erythematosis Nervous System: Apnea, coma Renal and Urinary: Hyponatremia/inappropriate ADH secretion, kidney failure"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. (5.1) Propafenone hydrochloride may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. (4, 5.2) Avoid use with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3) Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. (5.4) May provoke overt heart failure. (5.5) May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Only use in patients with conduction disorders who have pacemakers. (5.6) May affect artificial pacemakers.Monitor pacemaker function. (5.7) Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. (5.8) May exacerbate myasthenia gravis. (5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride tablets be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride tablets supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label, multicenter trial in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the nine patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had a recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride tablets (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrythmia is present throughout treatment. In a study of sustained-release propafenone, there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled sustained-release propafenone group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall sustained-release propafenone and propafenone immediate-release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone hydrochloride. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone hydrochloride, and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone hydrochloride tablets. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride, new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia; of those 0.9% were considered probably or definitely related to propafenone HCl. Of the patients with CHF probably related to propafenone, 80% had preexisting heart failure and 85% had coronary artery disease. CHF attributable to propafenone HCl developed rarely (< 0.2%) in ventricular arrhythmia patients who had no previous history of CHF. CHF occurred in 1.9% of patients studied with PAF or PSVT. In a U.S. trial of sustained-release propafenone in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving sustained-release propafenone (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. The incidence of first degree, second degree, and third degree AV block observed in 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients was 2.5%, 0.6%, and 0.2%, respectively. Development of second or third degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or discontinuation of propafenone HCl. Bundle branch block (1.2%) and intraventricular conduction delay (1.1%) have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Bradycardia has also been reported (1.5%). Experience in patients with sick sinus node syndrome is limited and these patients should not be treated with propafenone. In a U.S. trial in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with sustained-release propafenone, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with sustained-release propafenone and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone hydrochloride. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and, if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone hydrochloride administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "Drug Interactions Quinidine Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). There is, as yet, too little information to recommend concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Local Anesthetics Concomitant use of local anesthetics (i.e., during pacemaker implantations, surgery, or dental use) may increase the risks of central nervous system side effects. Digitalis Propafenone hydrochloride produces dose-related increases in serum digoxin levels ranging from about 35% at 450 mg/day to 85% at 900 mg/day of propafenone without affecting digoxin renal clearance. These elevations of digoxin levels were maintained for up to 16 months during concomitant administration. Plasma digoxin levels of patients on concomitant therapy should be measured, and digoxin dosage should ordinarily be reduced when propafenone is started, especially if a relatively large digoxin dose is used or if plasma concentrations are relatively high. Beta-Antagonists In a study involving healthy subjects, concomitant administration of propafenone and propranolol has resulted in substantial increases in propranolol plasma concentration and elimination half-life with no change in propafenone plasma levels from control values. Similar observations have been reported with metoprolol. Propafenone appears to inhibit the hydroxylation pathway for the two beta-antagonists (just as quinidine inhibits propafenone metabolism). Increased plasma concentrations of metoprolol could overcome its relative cardioselectivity. In propafenone clinical trials, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. While the therapeutic range for beta-blockers is wide, a reduction in dosage may be necessary during concomitant administration with propafenone. Warfarin In a study of eight healthy subjects receiving propafenone and warfarin concomitantly, mean steady-state warfarin plasma concentrations increased 39% with a corresponding increase in prothrombin times of approximately 25%. It is therefore recommended that prothrombin times be routinely monitored and the dose of warfarin be adjusted if necessary. Cimetidine Concomitant administration of propafenone and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone with no detectable changes in electrocardiographic parameters beyond that measured on propafenone alone. Desipramine Concomitant administration of propafenone and desipramine may result in elevated serum desipramine levels. Both desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, and propafenone are cleared by oxidative pathways of demthylation and hydroxylation carried out by the hepatic P-450 cytochrome. Cyclosporin Propafenone therapy may increase levels of cyclosporin. Theophylline Propafenone may increase theophylline concentration during concomitant therapy with the development of theophylline toxicity. Rifampin Rifampin may accelerate the metabolism and decrease the plasma levels and antiarrhythmic efficacy of propafenone. Other Limited experience with propafenone combined with calcium antagonists and diuretics has been reported without evidence of clinically significant adverse reactions. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 might lead to increased plasma levels of propafenone. When propafenone is administered with inhibitors of these enzymes, the patients should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 may increase propafenone levels which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Simultaneous use with both a CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor (or in patients with CYP2D6 deficiency) should be avoided. (7.1) •Propafenone may increase digoxin or warfarin levels. (7.2, 7.3) •Orlistat may reduce propafenone concentrations. Abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stable on Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules has resulted in convulsions, atrioventricular block, and circulatory failure. (7.4) •Concomitant use of lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. (7.6) 7.1 CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Dosage and Administration (2)]. Amiodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate-release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Fluoxetine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S-propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39% and 50%, respectively, and the R-propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71% and 50%, respectively. Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg 3 times daily) with 150-mg immediate-release propafenone 3 times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in extensive metabolizers, making them poor metabolizers. Steady-state plasma concentrations increased by more than 2 fold for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100-mg dose of quinidine increased steady-state concentrations of propafenone 3 fold. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine. Rifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5-OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In poor metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and an increase in the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74% and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5-OH‑propafenone by 69% and 57%, respectively. 7.2 Digoxin Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady-state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60% to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31% to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In postmarketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block, and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate-release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5% and greater than placebo) excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug included the following: dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules 225 mg twice daily in 126 patients, to Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules 325 mg twice daily in 135 patients, to Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules 425 mg twice daily in 136 patients, and to placebo in 126 patients for up to 39 weeks (mean 20 weeks) in a placebo-controlled trial (RAFT) conducted in the US. The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5% and greater than placebo) excluding those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug or because they were associated with the condition being treated, were dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, taste disturbance, nausea, fatigue, anxiety, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, edema, and influenza. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17%, and the rate was highest during the first 14 days of treatment. Cardiac-related adverse events occurring in ≥2% of the patients in any of the RAFT propafenone SR treatment groups and more common with propafenone than with placebo, excluding those that are common in the population and those not plausibly related to drug therapy, included the following: angina pectoris, atrial flutter, AV block first-degree, bradycardia, congestive cardiac failure, cardiac murmur, edema, dyspnea, rales, wheezing, and cardioactive drug level above therapeutic. Propafenone prolongs the PR and QRS intervals in patients with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Prolongation of the QRS interval makes it difficult to interpret the effect of propafenone on the QT interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Non-cardiac related adverse events occurring in ≥2% of the patients in any of the RAFT propafenone SR treatment groups and more common with propafenone than with placebo, excluding those that are common in the population and those not plausibly related to drug therapy, included the following: blurred vision, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, upper respiratory tract infection, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, hematuria, muscle weakness, dizziness (excluding vertigo), headache, taste disturbance, tremor, somnolence, anxiety, depression, ecchymosis. No clinically important differences in incidence of adverse reactions were noted by age or gender. Too few non-Caucasian patients were enrolled to assess adverse events according to race. Adverse events occurring in 2% or more of the patients in any of the ERAFT [see Clinical Studies (14)] propafenone SR treatment groups and not listed above include the following: bundle branch block left, bundle branch block right, conduction disorders, sinus bradycardia, and hypotension.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. (5.1) •Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. Evaluate patients via ECG after initiation of therapy. (4, 5.2) •Avoid use with other antiarrhythmic agents or drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3) •Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. (5.4) •May provoke overt heart failure. (5.5) •May cause dose-related first-degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Should not be given to patients with conduction defects in absence of a pacemaker. (5.6) •May affect artificial pacemakers. Pacemakers should be monitored during therapy. (5.7) •Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. (5.8) •Administer cautiously to patients with impaired hepatic and renal function. (5.9, 5.10) •Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported. (5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In the RAFT trial [see Clinical Studies (14)], there were too few deaths to assess the long-term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled group for Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall database of 8 trials of Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules and immediate-release propafenone hydrochloride, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. In a US uncontrolled, open-label, multicenter trial using the immediate-release formulation in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the trial. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the 9 patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had recurrence of SVT during the trial which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsades de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST trial [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrythmia is present throughout treatment. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules. Perform an ECG after initiation of Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Use With Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use With Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the US population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients With a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta-blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In the US trial (RAFT) in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules (all doses), compared with 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. Proarrhythmic effects more likely occur when propafenone is administered to patients with heart failure (NYHA III and IV) or severe myocardial ischemia [see Contraindications (4)]. In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release, new or worsened heart failure has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia. These events were more likely in subjects with pre-existing heart failure and coronary artery disease. New onset of heart failure attributable to propafenone developed in <0.2% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia and in 1.9% of patients with paroxysmal AF or PSVT. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first-degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a US trial (RAFT) in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy; the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients With Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared with 3% to 40% in patients with normal liver function when given propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release tablets. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease administered propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release tablets, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. No trials have compared bioavailability of propafenone from Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules in patients with normal and impaired hepatic function. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.10 Use in Patients With Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release tablets. No trials have been performed to assess the percentage of metabolites eliminated in the urine following the administration of Propafenone Hydrochloride Extended-Release (SR) Capsules. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients With Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs, and rabbits after high-dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term administration of propafenone hydrochloride on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed. 7.3 Warfarin The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio). 7.4 Orlistat Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In post marketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block and acute circulatory failure. 7.5 Beta-Antagonists Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. 7.6 Lidocaine No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse events with propafenone (>5%) included: unusual taste, nausea and/or vomiting, dizziness, constipation, headache, fatigue, first degree AV block, and intraventricular conduction delay. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Qualitest Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-444-4011 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions associated with propafenone hydrochloride occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. About 20% of patients treated with propafenone hydrochloride have discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions reported for > 1.5% of 474 SVT patients who received propafenone hydrochloride in U.S. clinical trials are presented in Table 1 by incidence and percent discontinuation, reported to the nearest percent. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported for > 1.5% of SVT Patients Incidence % of Pts. Who (N = 480) Discontinued Unusual Taste 14% 1.3% Nausea and/or Vomiting 11% 2.9% Dizziness 9% 1.7% Constipation 8% 0.2% Headache 6% 0.8% Fatigue 6% 1.5% Blurred Vision 3% 0.6% Weakness 3% 1.3% Dyspnea 2% 1.0% Wide Complex Tachycardia 2% 1.9% CHF 2% 0.6% Bradycardia 2% 0.2% Palpitations 2% 0.2% Tremor 2% 0.4% Anorexia 2% 0.2% Diarrhea 2% 0.4% Ataxia 2% 0.0% In controlled trials in patients with ventricular arrhythmia, the most common reactions reported for propafenone hydrochloride and more frequent than on placebo were unusual taste, dizziness, first degree AV block, intraventricular conduction delay, nausea and/or vomiting, and constipation. Headache was relatively common also, but was not increased compared to placebo. Other reactions reported more frequently than on placebo or comparator and not already reported elsewhere included anxiety, angina, second degree AV block, bundle branch block, loss of balance, congestive heart failure, and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions reported for ≥ 1% of 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients who received propafenone in U.S. clinical trials were evaluated by daily dose. The most common adverse reactions appeared dose-related (but note that most patients spent more time at the larger doses), especially dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, unusual taste, constipation, and blurred vision. Some less common reactions may also have been dose-related such as first degree AV block, congestive heart failure, dyspepsia, and weakness. Other adverse reactions included rash, syncope, chest pain, abdominal pain, ataxia, and hypotension. In addition, the following adverse reactions were reported less frequently than 1% either in clinical trials or in marketing experience. Causality and relationship to propafenone therapy cannot necessarily be judged from these events. Cardiovascular System: Atrial flutter, AV dissociation, cardiac arrest, flushing, hot flashes, sick sinus syndrome, sinus pause or arrest, supraventricular tachycardia. Nervous System: Abnormal dreams, abnormal speech, abnormal vision, confusion, depression, memory loss, numbness, paresthesias, psychosis/mania, seizures (0.3%), tinnitus, unusual smell sensation, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: Cholestasis, elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases), gastroenteritis, hepatitis . Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, anemia, bruising, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Other: Alopecia, eye irritation, impotence, increased glucose, positive ANA (0.7%), muscle cramps, muscle weakness, nephrotic syndrome, pain, pruritus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of propafenone hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: A number of patients with liver abnormalities associated with propafenone therapy have been reported in post-marketing experience. Some appeared due to hepatocellular injury, some were cholestatic and some showed a mixed picture. Some of these reports were simply discovered through clinical chemistries, others because of clinical symptoms including fulminant hepatitis and death. One case was rechallenged with a positive outcome. B lood and Lymphatic System: Increased bleeding time Immune System: lupus erythematosis Nervous System: Apnea, coma Renal and Urinary: Hyponatremia/inappropriate ADH secretion, kidney failure"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS May cause new or worsened arrhythmias. Evaluate patients via ECG prior to and during therapy. (5.1) Propafenone hydrochloride may unmask Brugada or Brugada-like Syndrome. (4, 5.2) Avoid use with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. (5.3) Avoid simultaneous use of propafenone with both a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor and a 3A4 inhibitor. (5.4) May provoke overt heart failure. (5.5) May cause dose-related first degree AV block or other conduction disturbances. Only use in patients with conduction disorders who have pacemakers. (5.6) May affect artificial pacemakers. Monitor pacemaker function. (5.7) Agranulocytosis: Patients should report signs of infection. (5.8) May exacerbate myasthenia gravis. (5.11) 5.1 Proarrhythmic Effects Propafenone has caused new or worsened arrhythmias. Such proarrhythmic effects include sudden death and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, asystole and torsade de pointes. It may also worsen premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular arrhythmias, and it may prolong the QT interval. It is therefore essential that each patient given propafenone hydrochloride be evaluated electrocardiographically prior to and during therapy to determine whether the response to propafenone hydrochloride supports continued treatment. Because propafenone prolongs the QRS interval in the electrocardiogram, changes in the QT interval are difficult to interpret [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In a U.S. uncontrolled, open label, multicenter trial in patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 1.9% (9/474) of these patients experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the study. However, in 4 of the 9 patients, the ventricular tachycardia was of atrial origin. Six of the nine patients that developed ventricular arrhythmias did so within 14 days of onset of therapy. About 2.3% (11/474) of all patients had a recurrence of SVT during the study which could have been a change in the patients’ arrhythmia behavior or could represent a proarrhythmic event. Case reports in patients treated with propafenone for atrial fibrillation/flutter have included increased premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), VT, VF, torsade de pointes, asystole, and death. Overall in clinical trials with propafenone hydrochloride (which included patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and PSVT), 4.7% of all patients had new or worsened ventricular arrhythmia possibly representing a proarrhythmic event (0.7% was an increase in PVCs; 4.0% a worsening, or new appearance, of VT or VF). Of the patients who had worsening of VT (4%), 92% had a history of VT and/or VT/VF, 71% had coronary artery disease, and 68% had a prior myocardial infarction. The incidence of proarrhythmia in patients with less serious or benign arrhythmias, which include patients with an increase in frequency of PVCs, was 1.6%. Although most proarrhythmic events occurred during the first week of therapy, late events also were seen and the CAST study [see Boxed Warning: Mortality] suggests that an increased risk of proarrythmia is present throughout treatment. In a study of sustained-release propafenone, there were too few deaths to assess the long term risk to patients. There were 5 deaths, 3 in the pooled sustained-release propafenone group (0.8%) and 2 in the placebo group (1.6%). In the overall sustained-release propafenone and propafenone hydrochloride immediate-release database of 8 studies, the mortality rate was 2.5% per year on propafenone and 4.0% per year on placebo. Concurrent use of propafenone with other antiarrhythmic agents has not been well studied. 5.2 Unmasking Brugada Syndrome Brugada Syndrome may be unmasked after exposure to propafenone hydrochloride. Perform an ECG after initiation of propafenone hydrochloride, and discontinue the drug if changes are suggestive of Brugada Syndrome [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Use with Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of propafenone hydrochloride in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been extensively studied. Such drugs may include many antiarrhythmics, some phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and oral macrolides. Withhold Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents for at least 5 half-lives prior to dosing with propafenone hydrochloride. Avoid the use of propafenone with Class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents (including quinidine and amiodarone). There is only limited experience with the concomitant use of Class IB or IC antiarrhythmics. 5.4 Drug Interactions: Simultaneous Use with Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 isoenzymes. Approximately 6% of Caucasians in the U.S. population are naturally deficient in CYP2D6 activity and to a somewhat lesser extent in other demographic groups. Drugs that inhibit these CYP pathways (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline for CYP2D6; ketoconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir, and grapefruit juice for CYP3A4; and amiodarone and tobacco smoke for CYP1A2) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Increased exposure to propafenone may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and exaggerated beta-adrenergic blocking activity. Because of its metabolism, the combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition in users of propafenone is potentially hazardous. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Heart Failure Propafenone exerts a negative inotropic activity on the myocardium as well as beta blockade effects and may provoke overt heart failure. In clinical trial experience with propafenone hydrochloride, new or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported in 3.7% of patients with ventricular arrhythmia; of those 0.9% were considered probably or definitely related to propafenone HCl. Of the patients with CHF probably related to propafenone, 80% had preexisting heart failure and 85% had coronary artery disease. CHF attributable to propafenone HCl developed rarely (< 0.2%) in ventricular arrhythmia patients who had no previous history of CHF. CHF occurred in 1.9% of patients studied with PAF or PSVT. In a U.S. trial of sustained-release propafenone in patients with symptomatic AF, heart failure was reported in 4 (1.0%) patients receiving sustained-release propafenone (all doses), compared to 1 (0.8%) patient receiving placebo. 5.6 Conduction Disturbances Propafenone slows atrioventricular conduction and may also cause dose-related first degree AV block. Average PR interval prolongation and increases in QRS duration are also dose-related. Do not give propafenone to patients with atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects in the absence of a pacemaker [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The incidence of first degree, second degree, and third degree AV block observed in 2,127 ventricular arrhythmia patients was 2.5%, 0.6%, and 0.2%, respectively. Development of second or third degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or discontinuation of propafenone HCl. Bundle branch block (1.2%) and intraventricular conduction delay (1.1%) have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Bradycardia has also been reported (1.5%). Experience in patients with sick sinus node syndrome is limited and these patients should not be treated with propafenone. In a U.S. trial in 523 patients with a history of symptomatic AF treated with sustained-release propafenone, sinus bradycardia (rate <50 beats/min) was reported with the same frequency with sustained-release propafenone and placebo. 5.7 Effects on Pacemaker Threshold Propafenone may alter both pacing and sensing thresholds of implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. During and after therapy, monitor and re-program these devices accordingly. 5.8 Agranulocytosis Agranulocytosis has been reported in patients receiving propafenone. Generally, the agranulocytosis occurred within the first 2 months of propafenone therapy and upon discontinuation of therapy, the white count usually normalized by 14 days. Unexplained fever or decrease in white cell count, particularly during the initial 3 months of therapy, warrant consideration of possible agranulocytosis or granulocytopenia. Instruct patients to report promptly any signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, or chills. 5.9 Use in Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction Propafenone is highly metabolized by the liver. Severe liver dysfunction increases the bioavailability of propafenone to approximately 70% compared to 3 to 40% in patients with normal liver function. In 8 patients with moderate to severe liver disease, the mean half-life was approximately 9 hours. Increased bioavailability of propafenone in these patients may result in excessive accumulation. Carefully monitor patients with impaired hepatic function for excessive pharmacological effects [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.10 Use in Patients with Renal Dysfunction Approximately 50% of propafenone metabolites are excreted in the urine following administration of propafenone hydrochloride. In patients with impaired renal function, monitor for signs of overdosage [see Overdosage (10)]. 5.11 Use in Patients with Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis has been reported during propafenone therapy. 5.12 Elevated ANA Titers Positive ANA titers have been reported in patients receiving propafenone. They have been reversible upon cessation of treatment and may disappear even in the face of continued propafenone therapy. These laboratory findings were usually not associated with clinical symptoms, but there is one published case of drug-induced lupus erythematosis (positive rechallenge); it resolved completely upon discontinuation of therapy. Carefully evaluate patients who develop an abnormal ANA test and, if persistent or worsening elevation of ANA titers is detected, consider discontinuing therapy. 5.13 Impaired Spermatogenesis Reversible disorders of spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in monkeys, dogs and rabbits after high dose intravenous administration of propafenone. Evaluation of the effects of short-term propafenone hydrochloride administration on spermatogenesis in 11 normal subjects suggested that propafenone produced a reversible, short-term drop (within normal range) in sperm count."

        "Drug Interactions Propafenone is metabolized by CYP2D6 (major pathway) and CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline), CYP1A2 (such as amiodarone), and CYP3A4 (such as ketaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. Appropriate monitoring is recommended when propafenone ER capsules are used together with such drugs. In addition, propafenone is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of propafenone with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, imipramine, haloperidol, venlafaxine) might lead to increased plasma concentrations of these drugs. The effect of propafenone on the P-Glycoprotein transporter has not been studied. Quinidine: Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg TID) with 150 mg immediate release propafenone TID decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in EM, making them PM. Steady state plasma concentrations increased by more than 2-fold for propafenone, and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100 mg dose of quinidine increased steady state con­centrations of propafenone 3-fold. Concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine is not recommended. Digoxin: Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60 to 270%, and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31 to 67%. Plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone should be monitored and digoxin dosage adjusted as needed. Lidocaine: No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lido­caine have been reported to increase the risks of central nervous sys­tem side effects of lidocaine. Beta-Antagonists: Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100-400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metopro­lol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not expe­rience an increased incidence of side effects. Warfarin: The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time in patients taking warfarin. Adjustment of the warfarin dose should be guided by monitoring of the prothrombin time. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady state plasma concentrations of propafenone. Rifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In poor metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and increased the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74 and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5OH-propafenone by 69 and 57%. Fluoxetine: Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39 and 50% and the R propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71 and 50%. Amiodarone: Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended."

Laboratory: Electrocardiograms Propafenone prolongs the PR and QRS intervals in patients with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Prolongation of the QRS interval makes it difficult to interpret the effect of propafenone on the QT interval.
