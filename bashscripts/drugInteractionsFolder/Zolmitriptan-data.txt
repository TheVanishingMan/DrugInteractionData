        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications(like dihydroergotamine or methysergide)and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D Agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists(including triptans)within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs)or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors(SNRIs)[see Warnings and Precautions(5.7) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Arrthymias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Risks in Patients with Phenyketonuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8%(167 out of 2,058)withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions(≥ 5% and > placebo)in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with migraines(Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)[see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets(n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions(those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients)and rare adverse reactions(those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General: Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological: Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin: Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Oral Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.7, 7.4) Patients with Phenylketonuria: Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contains phenylalanine (5.9) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease(CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm(Prinzmetal's Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors(e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD)prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications(4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrering the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG)immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications(4) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal's variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablet and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.1 mg phenylalanine. Each 5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 4.2 mg phenylalanine."

Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets in patients receiving MAO‑A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan tablets or zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan tablets or zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan tablets or zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24‑hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: •Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. •Arrthymias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. •Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. •Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. •Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. •Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. •Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. •Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. •Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Most common adverse reactions (≥5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Impax Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-994-6729 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan tablets 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan tablets in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan tablets group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical TrialsOnly adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5‑HT1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan tablets or zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) • Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets/ zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets if occurs (5.2) • Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) • Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets/ zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets if occurs (5.4) • Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets/ zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets if occurs (5.5) • Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) • Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets/ zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets if occurs (5.7, 7.4) • Patients with Phenylketonuria: zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (5.9) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan tablets/ zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5‑HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets or zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. Do not administer zolmitriptan tablets or zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan tablets or zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan tablets or zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life‑threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5‑HT1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets/ zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff‑Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5‑HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan tablets/ zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5‑HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal’s variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5‑HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5‑HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5‑HT1 agonists, including zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5‑HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan tablets or zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets doses [see Contraindications (4) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5‑HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5‑HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets or zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5‑HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets -treated patients. Zolmitriptan tablets and zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg and 5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.81 and 5.62 mg of phenylalanine, respectively. Zolmitriptan tablets do not contain phenylalanine."

        "Drug Interactions: All drug interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers using a single 10 mg dose of zolmitriptan and a single dose of the other drug except where otherwise noted. Fluoxetine: The pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan, as well as its effect on blood pressure, were unaffected by 4 weeks of pretreatment with oral fluoxetine (20 mg/day). MAO Inhibitors: Following one week of administration of 150 mg bid moclobemide, a specific MAO-A inhibitor, there was an increase of about 25% in both Cmax and AUC for zolmitriptan and a 3-fold increase in the Cmax and AUC of the active N-desmethyl metabolite of zolmitriptan (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). Selegiline, a selective MAO-B inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg/day for 1 week, had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its metabolite. Propranolol: Cmax and AUC of zolmitriptan increased 1.5-fold after one week of dosing with propranolol (160 mg/day). Cmax and AUC of the N-desmethyl metabolite were reduced by 30% and 15%, respectively. There were no interactive effects on blood pressure or pulse rate following administration of propranolol with zolmitriptan. Acetaminophen: A single 1 g dose of acetaminophen does not alter the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan and its N-desmethyl metabolite. However, zolmitriptan delayed the Tmax of acetaminophen by one hour. Metoclopramide: A single 10 mg dose of metoclopramide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of zolmitriptan or its metabolites. Oral Contraceptives: Retrospective analysis of pharmacokinetic data across studies indicated that mean plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan were generally higher in females taking oral contraceptives compared to those not taking oral contraceptives. Mean Cmax and AUC of zolmitriptan were found to be higher by 30% and 50%, respectively, and Tmax was delayed by one-half hour in females taking oral contraceptives. The effect of zolmitriptan on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives has not been studied. Cimetidine: Following the administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of a 5 mg dose of zolmitriptan and its active metabolite were approximately doubled (see PRECAUTIONS).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Serious cardiac events, including myocardial infarction, have occurred following the use of ZOMIG Tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported, in association with drugs of this class, have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Among 2,633 patients treated with ZOMIG Tablets in the active and placebo controlled trials, no patients withdrew for reasons related to adverse events, but as patients treated a single headache in these trials, the opportunity for discontinuation was limited. In a long-term, open label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse experience. The most common events were paresthesia, asthenia, nausea, dizziness, pain, chest or neck tightness or heaviness, somnolence, and warm sensation. Table 2 lists the adverse events that occurred in ≥ 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the ZOMIG 1 mg, ZOMIG 2.5 mg or ZOMIG 5 mg Tablets dose groups of the controlled clinical trials. Only events that were more frequent in a ZOMIG Tablets group compared to the placebo groups are included. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Several of the adverse events appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence, and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 2: Adverse Experience Incidence in Five Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials: Events Reported By ≥ 2% Patients Treated With ZOMIG Tablets Adverse Event Type Placebo (n=401) ZOMIG 1 mg (n=163) ZOMIG 2.5 mg (n=498) ZOMIG 5 mg (n=1012) ATYPICAL SENSATIONS 6% 12% 12% 18% Hyperesthesia 1% 1% 1% 2% Paresthesia (all types) 2% 5% 7% 9% Sensation warm/cold 4% 6% 5% 7% PAIN AND PRESSURE SENSATIONS 7% 13% 14% 22% Chest - pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1% 2% 3% 4% Neck/throat/jaw - pain/tightness/pressure 3% 4% 7% 10% Heaviness other than chest or neck 1% 1% 2% 5% Pain − location specified 1% 2% 2% 3% Other − Pressure/tightness/heaviness 0 2% 2% 2% DIGESTIVE 8% 11% 16% 14% Dry mouth 2% 5% 3% 3% Dyspepsia 1% 3% 2% 1% Dysphagia 0% 0% 0% 2% Nausea 4% 4% 9% 6% NEUROLOGICAL 10% 11% 17% 21% Dizziness 4% 6% 8% 10% Somnolence 3% 5% 6% 8% Vertigo 0% 0% 0% 2% OTHER Asthenia 3% 5% 3% 9% Palpitations 1% 0% <1% 2% Myalgia <1% 1% 1% 2% Myasthenia <1% 0% 1% 2% Sweating 1% 0% 2% 3% ZOMIG is generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients; use of prophylactic medications; or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of ZOMIG in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used ZOMIG Tablets (n=4,027) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients exposed to ZOMIG Tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical sensation: Infrequent was hyperesthesia. General: Infrequent were allergy reaction, chills, facial edema, fever, malaise, and photosensitivity. Cardiovascular: Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare were bradycardia, extrasystoles, postural hypotension, QT prolongation, tachycardia, and thrombophlebitis. Digestive: Infrequent were increased appetite, tongue edema, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, liver function abnormality, and thirst. Rare were anorexia, constipation, gastritis, hematemesis, pancreatitis, melena, and ulcer. Hemic: Infrequent was ecchymosis. Rare were cyanosis, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, and leukopenia. Metabolic: Infrequent was edema. Rare were hyperglycemia and alkaline phosphatase increased. Musculoskeletal: Infrequent were back pain, leg cramps, and tenosynovitis. Rare were arthritis, asthenia, tetany, and twitching. Neurological: Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability, and insomnia. Rare were akathisia, amnesia, apathy, ataxia, dystonia, euphoria, hallucinations, cerebral ischemia, hyperkinesia, hypotonia, hypertonia, and irritability. Respiratory: Infrequent were bronchitis, bronchospasm, epistaxis, hiccup, laryngitis, and yawn. Rare were apnea and voice alteration. Skin: Infrequent were pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Special Senses: Infrequent were dry eye, eye pain, hyperacusis, ear pain, parosmia, and tinnitus. Rare were diplopia and lacrimation. Urogenital: Infrequent were hematuria, cystitis, polyuria, urinary frequency, urinary urgency. Rare were miscarriage and dysmenorrhea. The adverse experiences profile seen with ZOMIG-ZMT Tablets was similar to that seen with ZOMIG Tablets. Postmarketing Experience with ZOMIG Tablets: The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and which have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and non-domestic use of oral zolmitriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Cardiovascular: Coronary artery vasospasm; transient myocardial ischemia, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction. Digestive: Very rare gastrointestinal ischemic events including splenic infarction, ischemic colitis and gastrointestinal infarction or necrosis have been reported; these may present as bloody diarrhea or abdominal pain. (See WARNINGS.) Neurological: As with other acute migraine treatments including other 5HT1 agonists, there have been rare reports of headache. General: As with other 5-HT1B/1D agonists, there have been very rare reports of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions in patients receiving ZOMIG. There have been rare reports of hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema. Serotonin syndrome has also been reported during the postmarketing period (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D Agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: •Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. •Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. •Chest and/or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. •Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. •Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. •Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. •Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. •Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to one year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-controlled Migraine Clinical Trials Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n = 4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General: Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological: Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin: Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions As with other 5-HT1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) • Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) • Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) • Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) • Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) • Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) • Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.7, 7.4) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal’s variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mmHg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mmHg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24 hour period [see Dosage and Administration, (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in > 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

Adults Among 460 patients treating 1180 single attacks with ZOMIG nasal spray in a blinded placebo-controlled trial (Study 1), there was a low withdrawal rate related to adverse reactions: 5 mg (1.3%), 2.5 mg (0%), and placebo (0.4%). None of the withdrawals were due to a serious event. One patient was withdrawn due to abnormal ECG changes from baseline that were incidentally found 23 days after the last dose of ZOMIG nasal spray. The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and > placebo) in any dosage strength in clinical trials for ZOMIG nasal spray were: unusual taste, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions was generally dose‑related. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions from the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in ≥2% of patients in either the 2.5 or 5 mg ZOMIG nasal spray dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse reactions in a Placebo-Controlled Study in Adult Patients with Migraine (Study 1) Body System Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=228) ZOMIG 2.5 mg (N=224) ZOMIG 5 mg (N=236) Atypical Sensations Hyperesthesia 0% 1% 5% Paraesthesia 6% 5% 10% Warm Sensation 2% 4% 0% Ear/Nose/Throat Disorder/Discomfort of nasal cavity 2% 1% 3% Pain and Pressure Sensations Pain Location Specified 1% 2% 4% Throat Pain 1% 4% 4% Throat Tightness 1% <1% 2% Digestive Dry Mouth <1% 3% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 4% Neurological Dizziness 4% 6% 3% Somnolence 2% 1% 4% Other Unusual Taste 3% 17% 21% Asthenia 1% 3% 3% In Study 1, adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% and < 2% of patients in all attacks in either ZOMIG nasal spray dose group and with incidence greater than that of placebo were: abdominal pain, chills, throat pressure, facial edema, chest pressure, palpitation, dysphagia, arthralgia, myalgia, and depersonalization. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients (18-39 vs. 40-65 years of age), or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Local Adverse Reactions: Among 460 patients using ZOMIG 2.5 mg or 5 mg in the controlled clinical trial, approximately 3% noted local irritation or soreness at the site of administration. Adverse reactions of any kind, perceived in the nasopharynx (which may include systemic effects of triptans) were severe in about 1% of patients and approximately 57% resolved in 1 hour. Nasopharyngeal examinations, in a subset of patients participating in two long term trials of up to one year duration, failed to demonstrate any clinically significant changes with repeated use of ZOMIG nasal spray. All nasopharyngeal adverse reactions with an incidence of ≥ 2% of patients in any ZOMIG nasal spray dose groups are included in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of ZOMIG in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Reaction frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used ZOMIG nasal spray and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to ZOMIG nasal spray (n=3059). All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. General: Infrequent: allergic reactions. Cardiovascular: Infrequent: arrhythmias, hypertension, syncope and tachycardia. Rare: angina pectoris and myocardial infarct. Digestive: Rare: stomatitis. Neurological: Infrequent: agitation, amnesia, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and nervousness. Rare: convulsions. Respiratory: Infrequent: bronchitis, increased cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngeal edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and sinusitis. Skin: Infrequent: pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent: polyuria and urinary urgency. Rare: urinary frequency. Special senses: Infrequent: tinnitus. Rare: conjunctivitis, dry eye, and visual field defect. The adverse reaction profile seen with ZOMIG nasal spray is similar to that seen with ZOMIG tablets and ZOMIG-ZMT tablets except for the occurrence of local adverse reactions from the nasal spray (see ZOMIG tablet/ZOMIG‑ZMT oral disintegrating tablet Prescribing Information). Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The safety of ZOMIG nasal spray in the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in two studies [see Pediatric Use (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of ≥2% of pediatric patients receiving 2.5 mg and 5 mg ZOMIG nasal spray and numerically greater than placebo) after a single dose are summarized in Table 2. Dysgeusia (unusual taste) was the most common adverse reaction, with a numerically greater incidence for patients receiving ZOMIG compared to placebo (10% vs. 2%). Other common adverse reactions were nasal discomfort, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, and nausea. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions from the pooled placebo-controlled studies that occurred in ≥ 2% of pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in either the 2.5 mg or 5 mg ZOMIG dose groups and with an incidence greater than placebo. Table 2: Adverse reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Studies in Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 years of Age with Migraine Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=437) ZOMIG 2.5 mg (N=81) ZOMIG 5 mg (N=431) Unusual taste 2% 6% 10% Nasal discomfort 1% 3% 3% Dizziness 1% 0% 2% Oropharyngeal pain 2% 0% 2% Nausea 1% 1% 2% The adverse reaction profile was similar across gender. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of ZOMIG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving ZOMIG. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to ZOMIG."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) •Arrhythmias: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.2) •Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk (5.3) •Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.4) •Gastrointestinal ischemic events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.5) •Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) •Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue dosing if occurs (5.7, 7.5) •Increase in blood pressure: very rarely associated with significant events (5.8) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of ZOMIG. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including ZOMIG may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving ZOMIG. Do not administer ZOMIG if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first ZOMIG dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following ZOMIG administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of ZOMIG. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life‑threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5‑HT1 agonists. Discontinue ZOMIG if these disturbances occur. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson‑White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders should not receive ZOMIG [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5‑HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with ZOMIG and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina should not receive 5-HT1 agonists [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5‑HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5‑HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Discontinue ZOMIG if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions should be excluded. ZOMIG should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5‑HT1 agonists, including ZOMIG, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5‑HT1 agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional ZOMIG doses [see Contraindications (4) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5‑HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5‑HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including ZOMIG, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. ZOMIG treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.5) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5‑HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension. Very rarely these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of ZOMIG oral tablet, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of ZOMIG oral tablet. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in ZOMIG‑treated patients. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ]."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration, (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tabl ets: The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina : Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.7, 7.4) Patients with Phenylketonuria: Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contains phenylalanine (5.9) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal’s variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4) ]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mmHg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mmHg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zolmitriptan Orally Disintegrating Tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg and 5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.688 and 5.376 mg of phenylalanine, respectively. Zolmitriptan Tablets do not contain phenylalanine."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration, (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

Most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Jubilant Cadista Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-313-4623 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) • Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) • Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) • Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) • Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) • Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) • Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.7, 7.4) • Patients with Phenylketonuria: Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (5.9) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal’s variant angina [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4)]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg and 5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.12 and 2.24 mg of phenylalanine, respectively."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24 hour period [see Dosage and Administration, (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (> 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Arrthymias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in > 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials1 1Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Oral Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions As with other 5-HT1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan tablets. Do not administer zolmitriptan tablets if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan tablets dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan tablets administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan tablets and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal’s variant angina [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including zolmitriptan tablets, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan tablet doses [see Contraindications (4)]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan tablets, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan tablets. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan tablets-treated patients. Zolmitriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and ZOMIG within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of ZOMIG in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of ZOMIG treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If cimetidine and ZOMIG are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of ZOMIG to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: •Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. •Arrthymias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. •Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. •Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. •Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. •Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. •Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. •Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. •Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Most common adverse reactions (≥5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Impax Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-994-6729 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the ZOMIG 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of ZOMIG in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a ZOMIG group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea. Table 1: Adverse Reaction Incidence in Five Pooled Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical TrialsOnly adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a ZOMIG group compared to the placebo group are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with ZOMIG Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of ZOMIG in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used ZOMIG tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to ZOMIG tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with ZOMIG-ZMT Oral Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with ZOMIG-ZMT oral disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with ZOMIG tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of ZOMIG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5‑HT1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving ZOMIG. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to ZOMIG."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) • Arrhythmias: Discontinue ZOMIG if occurs (5.2) • Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) • Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue ZOMIG if occurs (5.4) • Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue ZOMIG if occurs (5.5) • Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) • Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue ZOMIG if occurs (5.7, 7.4) • Patients with Phenylketonuria: ZOMIG-ZMT contains phenylalanine (5.9) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of ZOMIG. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists including ZOMIG may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving ZOMIG. Do not administer ZOMIG if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4) ]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administrating the first ZOMIG dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following ZOMIG administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of ZOMIG. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life‑threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue ZOMIG if these disturbances occur. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with ZOMIG and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists including ZOMIG are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal’s variant angina [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions.

The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue ZOMIG if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of ZOMIG, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen.

As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in ZOMIG-treated patients. ZOMIG is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.9 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). ZOMIG-ZMT orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 2.5 mg and 5 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 2.81 and 5.62 mg of phenylalanine, respectively. ZOMIG tablets do not contain phenylalanine."

Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mmHg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mmHg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 7.5 Cimetidine Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If cimetidine and zolmitriptan are used concomitantly, limit the maximum single dose of zolmitriptan to 2.5 mg, not to exceed 5 mg in any 24-hour period [see Dosage and Administration, (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: •Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. •Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. •Chest and or Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. •Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. •Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. • Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. •Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. •Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and > placebo) were neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Generics Inc., USA at 1(888)721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a long-term, open-label study where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 8% (167 out of 2,058) withdrew from the trial because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and > placebo) in these trials were neck/throat/jaw pain, dizziness, paresthesia, asthenia, somnolence, warm/cold sensation, nausea, heaviness sensation, and dry mouth. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥2% of the 2,074 patients in any one of the zolmitriptan 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg dose groups in the controlled clinical trials of zolmitriptan in patients with migraines (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Only adverse reactions that were at least 2% more frequent in a zolmitriptan group compared to the placebo group are included. Several of the adverse reactions appear dose related, notably paresthesia, sensation of heaviness or tightness in chest, neck, jaw, and throat, dizziness, somnolence and possibly asthenia and nausea.

There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials in the following subgroups: gender, weight, age, use of prophylactic medications, or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Less Common Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Adverse reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of patients who used zolmitriptan tablets and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to zolmitriptan tablets (n=4,027). Reactions were further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions (those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) and rare adverse reactions (those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients). General : Infrequent were allergic reactions. Cardiovascular : Infrequent were arrhythmias, hypertension, and syncope. Rare was tachycardia. Neurological : Infrequent were agitation, anxiety, depression, emotional lability and insomnia; Rare were amnesia, hallucinations, and cerebral ischemia. Skin : Infrequent were pruritus, rash and urticaria. Urogenital: Infrequent were polyuria, urinary frequency and urinary urgency. Adverse Reactions with Zolmitriptan Oral Disintegrating Tablets The adverse reaction profile seen with zolmitriptan oral disintegrating tablets was similar to that seen with zolmitriptan tablets 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of zolmitriptan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the Clinical Trials Experience section above or the Warnings and Precautions section. Hypersensitivity Reactions: As with other 5-HT1B/1D agonists, there have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving zolmitriptan. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to zolmitriptan."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) • Arrhythmias: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.2) • Chest/Throat/Neck/Jaw Pain, Tightness, and Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for CAD in patients at high risk (5.3) • Cerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, and Stroke: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.4) • Gastrointestinal Ischemic Reactions and Peripheral Vasospastic Reactions: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.5) • Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) • Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue zolmitriptan if occurs (5.7, 7.4) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal Angina Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD). There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1agonists including zolmitriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving zolmitriptan. Do not administer zolmitriptan if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following zolmitriptan administration. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of zolmitriptan. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue zolmitriptan if these disturbances occur. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, and pressure in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with zolmitriptan and is usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. 5-HT1 agonists including zolmitriptan are contraindicated in patients with CAD or Prinzmetal’s variant angina [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical for migraine, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including zolmitriptan, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional zolmitriptan doses [see Contraindications (4)]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g. ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan. As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]."

Serious cardiac reactions, including myocardial infarction, have occurred following the use of ZOMIG Tablets. These reactions are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Reactions reported, in association with triptans, have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Among 464 adult patients treating single attacks with zolmitriptan nasal spray in a blinded placebo controlled trial, there was a low withdrawal rate related to adverse reactions: 5 mg (1.3%), and placebo (0.4%). None of the withdrawals were due to a serious reaction. One patient was withdrawn due to abnormal ECG changes from baseline that was incidentally found 23 days after the last dose of ZOMIG Nasal Spray. The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials for ZOMIG Nasal Spray were: unusual taste, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and dizziness. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of the 236 patients in the 5 mg dose group of the controlled clinical trial. Table 1: Adverse reactions with an incidence of ≥ 2% of patients in the zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray treatment group by body system and greater than placebo.

The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender, weight, or age of the patients (18-39 vs. 40-65 years of age), or presence of aura. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Local Adverse Reactions: Among 922 patients using the zolmitriptan nasal spray to treat 2311 attacks in the controlled clinical study who were exposed, across all doses (0.5 to 5 mg), approximately 3% noted local irritation or soreness at the site of administration. Adverse reactions of any kind, perceived in the nasopharynx (which may include systemic effects of triptans) were severe in about 1% of patients and approximately 60% resolved in 1 hour. Nasopharyngeal examinations, in a subset of patients participating in two long term trials of up to one year duration, failed to demonstrate any clinically significant changes with repeated use of ZOMIG Nasal Spray. All nasopharyngeal adverse reactions with an incidence of ≥ 2% of patients in any zolmitriptan nasal spray dose groups are included in ADVERSE REACTIONS Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented. Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of ZOMIG in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse reaction reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse reactions, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Reaction frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used ZOMIG Nasal Spray and reported a reaction divided by the total number of patients exposed to ZOMIG Nasal Spray (n=3059). All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Body: Infrequent: allergic reaction, back pain, chills, cyst, flu syndrome, infection, jaw pain, pressure other, jaw tightening, edema of the face, abnormal laboratory test, neck pain, neoplasm, and neck tightness, chest heaviness, chest pain, and chest pressure Rare: cellulitis, fever, jaw pressure, and neck heaviness Cardiovascular: Infrequent: arrhythmias, hypertension, syncope, thrombophlebitis, and tachycardia Rare: angina pectoris, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarct, vasodilation, and vascular disorder Digestive: Infrequent: diarrhea, dyspepsia, tongue edema, gastrointestinal disorder, increased saliva, and thirst Rare: increased appetite, colitis, constipation, eructation, gastritis, gastrointestinal carcinoma, gingivitis, hepatic neoplasia, intestinal obstruction, jaundice, sialadenitis, and stomatitis Endocrine System: Rare: hyperthyroidism and thyroid edema Hemic: Infrequent: cyanosis Rare: ecchymosis, lymphadenopathy and leukopenia Metabolic Nutritional: Rare: increased weight, dehydration, and peripheral edema Musculoskeletal: Infrequent: arthralgia, joint disorder, and myalgia Rare: bone pain, osteoporosis, tenosynovitis and twitching Nervous System: Infrequent: agitation, amnesia, anxiety, ataxia, abnormal coordination, confusion, depersonalization, depression, hypertonia, insomnia, nervousness, speech disorder, abnormal thinking, tremor, vertigo, and circumoral paresthesia Rare: apathy, convulsions, abnormal dreams, euphoria, hypertonia, irritability, tardive dyskinesia, manic reaction, neuropathy, and psychosis Respiratory: Infrequent: bronchitis, increased cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngeal edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, throat discomfort, and voice alteration Rare: hiccup, hyperventilation, laryngitis, pneumonia, increased sputum, and yawning Skin: Infrequent: pruritus, rash, skin disorder, and sweating Rare: eczema, erythema, erythema multiform, hair disorder, and neoplasm Special Senses: Infrequent: amblyopia, disorder of lacrimation, ear pain, eye pain, parosmia and tinnitus Rare: conjunctivitis, dry eye, photophobia, and visual field defect Urogenital: Infrequent: polyuria and menorrhagia Rare: breast carcinoma, dysmenorrhea, metrorrhagia, breast neoplasm, unintended pregnancy, suspicious PAP smear, uterine disorder, enlarged uterine fibroids, fibrocytic breast, vaginitis, urogenital neoplasm, cystitis, urinary tract infection, kidney pain, pyelonephritis, urinary frequency, urine impaired, and urinary tract disorder The adverse experience profile seen with ZOMIG Nasal Spray is similar to that seen with ZOMIG tablets and ZOMIG-ZMT tablets except for the occurrence of local adverse reactions from the nasal spray (see ZOMIG Tablet Prescribing Information). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience with ZOMIG Tablets The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of ZOMIG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following section enumerates potentially important adverse reactions that have occurred in clinical practice and which have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The reactions enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and non-domestic use of oral zolmitriptan. The reactions enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite reactions reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of reactions and the role of zolmitriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Cardiovascular: Coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction. Digestive: Very rare gastrointestinal ischemic reactions including splenic infarction, ischemic colitis and gastrointestinal infarction or necrosis have been reported; these may present as bloody diarrhea or abdominal pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. General: As with other 5-HT1B/1D agonists, there have been very rare reports of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions in patients receiving ZOMIG. There have been rare reports of hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema. Serotonin syndrome has also been reported during the postmarketing period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Neurological: As with other acute migraine treatments including other 5HT1 agonists, there have been rare reports of headache."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, and life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm (5.1) It is strongly recommended that ZOMIG not be given to patients in whom unrecognized coronary artery disease (CAD) is predicted by the presence of risk factors. In very rare cases, serious cardiovascular events have been reported in association with ZOMIG in the absence of known cardiovascular disease. If ZOMIG is considered, patients should first have a cardiovascular evaluation. If the evaluation is satisfactory, first dose should take place in a physician’s office setting (5.1) Sensations of pain, tightness, pressure and heaviness in the chest, throat, neck and jaw: generally not associated with myocardial ischemia, but patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of angina should be evaluated for the presence of CAD (5.2) Cerebrovascular events, some fatal (5.3) Gastrointestinal ischemic events and peripheral vasospastic reactions (e.g. Raynaud’s syndrome) (5.4) Patients with symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathways should not receive ZOMIG (5.1) Potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome, particularly in combination with SSRIs or SNRIs. Monitor patients carefully if concomitant treatment is clinically warranted (5.5, 7.6) Increase in blood pressure, very rarely associated with significant clinical events (4.4, 5.6) 5.1 Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events Cardiac Events and Fatalities with 5-HT1 Agonists Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, have been reported within a few hours following administration of zolmitriptan. Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of other 5-HT1 agonists. Considering the extent of use of 5-HT1 agonists in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low. ZOMIG can cause coronary artery vasospasm; at least one of these events occurred in a patient with no cardiac disease history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease. Because of the close proximity of the events to ZOMIG use, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. In the cases where there has been known underlying coronary artery disease, the relationship is uncertain. Patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following dosing should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal’s variant angina before receiving additional doses of medication, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Patients with symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders should not receive ZOMIG. Premarketing experience with zolmitriptan Among the more than 2,500 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled clinical trials of ZOMIG Tablets, no deaths or serious cardiac events were reported. In a premarketing controlled clinical trial of ZOMIG Nasal Spray, more than 1,300 patients participated and there were no deaths or serious cardiac events to report. Postmarketing experience with zolmitriptan Serious cardiovascular events have been reported in association with the use of ZOMIG Tablets, and in very rare cases, these events have occurred in the absence of known cardiovascular disease. The uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, however, makes it impossible to determine definitively the proportion of the reported cases that were actually caused by zolmitriptan or to reliably assess causation in individual cases. Patients with documented coronary artery disease Because of the potential of this class of compound (5-HT1 agonists) to cause coronary vasospasm, ZOMIG should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Patients with risk factors for CAD It is strongly recommended that zolmitriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized coronary artery disease (CAD) is predicted by the presence of risk factors (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient’s medical history, electrocardiographic or other investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, zolmitriptan should not be administered [see Contraindications (4.1)]. For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of zolmitriptan take place in the setting of a physician’s office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received zolmitriptan. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following ZOMIG, in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of ZOMIG and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use ZOMIG. The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to zolmitriptan. 5.2 Sensations of pain, tightness, pressure in the chest and or throat, neck and jaw As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw have been reported after treatment with ZOMIG Tablets. Because 5-HT1 agonists may cause coronary vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following dosing should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal’s variant angina before receiving additional doses of medication, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms occur. Patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina should not receive 5-HT1 agonists [see Contraindications (4.1)]. 5.3 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. It should be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (eg, stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack) [see Contraindications (4.2)]. 5.4 Other Vasospasm-Related Events, including Peripheral Vascular Ischemia and Colonic Ischemia 5-HT1 agonists, including ZOMIG, may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm, such as peripheral and gastrointestinal vascular ischemia with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Very rare reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Visual disorders may also be part of a migraine attack. Patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow following the use of any 5-HT agonist, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud’s syndrome, are candidates for further evaluation [see Contraindications (4.3)]. 5.5 Serotonin Syndrome The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including ZOMIG treatment, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). If concomitant treatment with ZOMIG and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram) or SNRI (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) [See Drug Interactions (7.5)]. 5.6 Increase in Blood Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported on rare occasions with ZOMIG Tablet use, in patients with and without a history of hypertension; very rarely these increases in blood pressure have been associated with significant clinical events. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In volunteers, an increase of 1 and 5 mm Hg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen at 5 mg. In the headache trials, vital signs were measured only in the small inpatient study and no effect on blood pressure was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver disease, 7 of 27 experienced 20 to 80 mm Hg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan [see Contraindications (4.4)]. An 18% increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure was seen following dosing with another 5-HT1 agonist in a study evaluating subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization. 5.7 Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues When pigmented rats were given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg of radiolabeled zolmitriptan, the radioactivity in the eye after 7 days, the latest time point examined, was still 75% of the value measured after 4 hours. This suggests that zolmitriptan and/or its metabolites may bind to the melanin of the eye. Because there could be accumulation in melanin rich tissues over time, this raises the possibility that zolmitriptan could cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. However, no effects on the retina related to treatment with zolmitriptan were noted in any of the toxicity studies including those conducted by the nasal route. Although no systematic monitoring of ophthalmologic function was undertaken in clinical trials, and no specific recommendations for ophthalmologic monitoring are offered, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects. 5.8 Laboratory Tests No monitoring of specific laboratory tests is recommended. 5.9 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Zolmitriptan is not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests."
