        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use with digoxin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug. (7.1) Some drugs which are actively secreted by the kidney may interact with trospium chloride tablets by competing for renal tubular secretion. (7.2) Concomitant use with metformin immediate release tablets reduced exposure and peak concentration of trospium. (7.4) 7.1 Digoxin Concomitant use of trospium chloride tablets and digoxin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Drugs Eliminated by Active Tubular Secretion Although demonstrated in a drug-drug interaction study not to affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, trospium chloride tablets have the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion (e.g., procainamide, pancuronium, morphine, vancomycin, and tenofovir). Coadministration of trospium chloride tablets with these drugs may increase the serum concentration of trospium chloride tablets and/or the coadministered drug due to competition for this elimination pathway. Careful patient monitoring is recommended in patients receiving such drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Antimuscarinic Agents The concomitant use of trospium chloride tablets with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Trospium chloride tablets may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.4 Metformin Co-administration of 500 mg metformin immediate release tablets twice daily with trospium chloride 60 mg extended release tablets reduced the steady-state systemic exposure of trospium by approximately 29% for mean AUC0-24 and by 34% for mean Cmax [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 1%) with trospium chloride tablets are dry mouth (20.1%), constipation (9.6%), and headache (4.2%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp., Drug Safety at 1-800-667-4708 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of trospium chloride tablets was evaluated in controlled clinical trials in a total of 2975 patients, who were treated with trospium chloride tablets (N=1673), placebo (N=1056) or active control medications (N=246). Of this total, 1181 patients participated in two, 12-week, U.S., efficacy and safety studies and a 9-month open-label extension. Of this total, 591 patients received trospium chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily. In all controlled trials combined, 232 and 208 patients received treatment with trospium chloride tablets for at least 24 and 52 weeks, respectively. In all placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidence of serious adverse events was 2.9% among patients receiving trospium chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily and 1.5% among patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists adverse reactions from the combined 12-week U.S. safety and efficacy trials were reported by at least 1% of patients, and were reported more frequently in the trospium chloride group than in the placebo group. The two most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving trospium chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily were dry mouth and constipation. The single most frequently reported adverse reaction for trospium chloride tablets, dry mouth, occurred in 20.1% of trospium chloride tablets treated patients and 5.8% of patients receiving placebo. In the two U.S. studies, dry mouth led to discontinuation in 1.9% of patients treated with trospium chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily. For the patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. Table 1. Incidence (%) of adverse reactions with trospium chloride, reported in greater than or equal to 1% of all patients treated with trospium chloride and more frequent with trospium chloride (20 mg twice daily) than placebo in Studies 1 and 2 combined Adverse Event Placebo (N=590) Trospium chloride 20 mg twice daily (N=591) Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry mouth 34 (5.8) 119 (20.1) Constipation 27 (4.6) 57 (9.6) Abdominal pain upper 7 (1.2) 9 (1.5) Constipation aggravated 5 (0.8) 8 (1.4) Dyspepsia 2 (0.3) 7 (1.2) Flatulence 5 (0.8) 7 (1.2) Nervous System Disorders Headache 12 (2.0) 25 (4.2) General disorders Fatigue 8 (1.4) 11 (1.9) Renal and urinary disorders Urinary retention 2 (0.3) 7 (1.2) Eye disorders Dry eyes NOS 2 (0.3) 7 (1.2) Abbreviations: NOS=not otherwise specified Other adverse reactions from the U.S., placebo-controlled trials, occurring in greater than or equal to 0.5% and less than 1.0% of trospium chloride tablets treated patients, and more common with trospium chloride tablets than placebo are: tachycardia, vision blurred, abdominal distension, vomiting, dysgeusia, dry throat, and dry skin. During controlled clinical studies, one adverse reaction of angioneurotic edema was reported. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trospium chloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal – gastritis; Cardiovascular – palpitations, supraventricular tachycardia, chest pain, syncope, “hypertensive crisis”; Immunological – Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anaphylactic reaction, angioedema; Nervous System – dizziness, confusion, vision abnormal, hallucinations, somnolence and delirium; Musculoskeletal – rhabdomyolysis; General – rash."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Trospium chloride tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction or gastrointestinal obstructive disorders due to risk of urinary or gastric retention. (5.1,5.3) Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with trospium chloride. (5.2) In patients with controlled narrow angle glaucoma trospium chloride tablets should be used only with careful monitoring. (5.4) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with trospium chloride tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how trospium chloride tablets affect them. (5.5) Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impairment on systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, the risk of anticholinergic adverse reactions is expected to be greater in patients with moderate renal impairment. (5.6) 5.1 Risk of Urinary Retention Trospium chloride tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with trospium chloride, the active ingredient in trospium chloride tablets. In one case, angioedema occurred after the first dose of trospium chloride. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, trospium chloride tablets should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Trospium chloride tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. Trospium chloride tablets, like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, intestinal atony and myasthenia gravis. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-angle Glaucoma In patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, trospium chloride tablets should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks and in that circumstance only with careful monitoring [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Trospium chloride tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how trospium chloride tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Patients with Moderate Renal Impairment Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impairment on systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in patients with moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]."

The data described below reflect exposure to trospium chloride extended-release capsules in 578 patients for 12 weeks in two Phase 3 double-blind, placebo controlled trials (n=1165). These studies included overactive bladder patients of ages 21 to 90 years, of which 86% were female and 85% were Caucasian. Patients received 60 mg daily doses of trospium chloride extended-release capsules. Patients in these studies were eligible to continue treatment with trospium chloride extended-release capsules 60 mg for up to one year. From both these controlled trials combined, 769 and 238 patients received treatment with trospium chloride extended-release capsules for at least 24 and 52 weeks, respectively. There were 157 (27.2%) trospium chloride extended-release capsules patients and 98 (16.7%) placebo patients who experienced one or more double-blind treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that were assessed by the investigator as at least possibly related to study medication. The most common TEAEs were dry mouth and constipation which, when reported, commonly occurred early in treatment (often within the first week). In the two Phase 3 studies, constipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention led to discontinuation in 1%, 0.7%, and 0.5% of patients treated with trospium chloride extended-release capsules 60 mg daily, respectively. In the placebo group, there were no discontinuations due to dry mouth or urinary retention and one due to constipation. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar among patients receiving trospium chloride extended-release capsules and patients receiving placebo. No treatment-emergent serious adverse events in either treatment group were judged by the investigators as being possibly related to the study medication. Table 1 lists those treatment-emergent adverse events from the trials that were assessed by the investigator as possibly related to study medication, reported in at least 1% of trospium chloride extended-release capsules patients, and were more common for the trospium chloride extended-release capsules group than for placebo.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Trospium is metabolized by ester hydrolysis and excreted by the kidneys through a combination of tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. Based on in vitro data, no clinically relevant metabolic drug-drug interactions are anticipated with trospium. However, some drugs which are actively secreted by the kidney may interact with trospium by competing for renal tubular secretion. The concomitant use of trospium chloride extended-release capsules with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Trospium chloride extended-release capsules may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. Some drugs which are actively secreted by the kidney may interact with trospium by competing for renal tubular secretion. (7) Concomitant use with digoxin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug. (7.1) Exposure to trospium on average was comparable in the presence of and without antacid, however, some individuals demonstrated increases or decreases in trospium exposure in the presence of antacid. The clinical relevance of these findings is not known. (7.2) Concomitant use with metformin immediate release tablets reduced exposure and peak concentration of trospium. (7.3) 7.1 Digoxin Concomitant use of trospium chloride 20 mg twice daily and digoxin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Antacid While the systemic exposure of trospium on average was comparable with and without antacid containing aluminum hydroxide and magnesium carbonate, 5 out of 11 individuals in a drug interaction study demonstrated either an increase or decrease in trospium exposure, in presence of antacid. The clinical relevance of these findings is not known [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Metformin Co-administration of 500 mg metformin immediate release tablets twice daily reduced the steady-state systemic exposure of trospium by approximately 29% for mean AUC0-24 and by 34% for mean Cmax. The effect of a decrease in trospium exposure on the efficacy of trospium chloride extended-release capsules is unknown. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin were comparable when administered with or without 60 mg trospium chloride extended-release capsules once daily under fasted condition. The effect of metformin at higher doses on trospium PK is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 1 %) with Trospium Chloride Extended-release Capsules are dry mouth (10.7%) and constipation (8.5%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The data described below reflect exposure to trospium chloride extended-release capsules in 578 patients for 12 weeks in two Phase 3 double-blind, placebo controlled trials (n=1165). These studies included overactive bladder patients of ages 21 to 90 years, of which 86% were female and 85% were Caucasian. Patients received 60 mg daily doses of trospium chloride extended-release capsules. Patients in these studies were eligible to continue treatment with trospium chloride extended-release capsules 60 mg for up to one year. From both these controlled trials combined, 769 and 238 patients received treatment with trospium chloride extended-release capsules for at least 24 and 52 weeks, respectively. There were 157 (27.2%) trospium chloride extended-release capsules patients and 98 (16.7%) placebo patients who experienced one or more double-blind treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that were assessed by the investigator as at least possibly related to study medication. The most common TEAEs were dry mouth and constipation which, when reported, commonly occurred early in treatment (often within the first week). In the two Phase 3 studies, constipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention led to discontinuation in 1%, 0.7%, and 0.5% of patients treated with trospium chloride extended-release capsules 60 mg daily, respectively. In the placebo group, there were no discontinuations due to dry mouth or urinary retention and one due to constipation. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar among patients receiving trospium chloride extended-release capsules and patients receiving placebo. No treatment-emergent serious adverse events in either treatment group were judged by the investigators as being possibly related to the study medication. Table 1 lists those treatment-emergent adverse events from the trials that were assessed by the investigator as possibly related to study medication, reported in at least 1% of trospium chloride extended-release capsules patients, and were more common for the trospium chloride extended-release capsules group than for placebo.

In the open-label treatment phase, the most common TEAEs reported in the 769 patients with at least 6 months exposure to trospium chloride extended-release capsules were: constipation, and dry mouth. Urinary tract infection and rash was also reported in several patients, including one of each judged by the investigator to be possibly related to treatment. Several adverse events were reported as severe in the open-label treatment phase, including one urinary tract infection, two urinary retention events, and one aggravated constipation. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trospium chloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal – gastritis; Cardiovascular – palpitations, supraventricular tachycardia, chest pain, syncope, “hypertensive crisis”; Immunological – Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anaphylactic reaction, angioedema; Nervous System – dizziness, confusion, vision abnormal, hallucinations, somnolence, and delirium; Musculoskeletal – rhabdomyolysis; General – rash."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-800-328-5113 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of Trospium Chloride Tablets was evaluated in controlled clinical trials in a total of 2975 patients, who were treated with Trospium Chloride Tablets (N=1673), placebo (N=1056) or active control medications (N=246). Of this total, 1181 patients participated in two, 12-week, U.S., efficacy and safety studies and a 9-month open-label extension. Of this total, 591 patients received Trospium Chloride Tablets 20 mg twice daily. In all controlled trials combined, 232 and 208 patients received treatment with Trospium Chloride Tablets for at least 24 and 52 weeks, respectively. In all placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidence of serious adverse events was 2.9% among patients receiving Trospium Chloride Tablets 20 mg twice daily and 1.5% among patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists adverse reactions from the combined 12-week U.S. safety and efficacy trials were reported by at least 1% of patients, and were reported more frequently in the Trospium Chloride Tablets group than in the placebo group. The two most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving Trospium Chloride Tablets 20 mg twice daily were dry mouth and constipation. The single most frequently reported adverse reaction for Trospium Chloride Tablets, dry mouth, occurred in 20.1% of Trospium Chloride Tablets treated patients and 5.8% of patients receiving placebo. In the two U.S. studies, dry mouth led to discontinuation in 1.9% of patients treated with Trospium Chloride Tablets 20 mg twice daily. For the patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Trospium Chloride Tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction or gastrointestinal obstructive disorders due to risk of urinary or gastric retention. (5.1, 5.3) •Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with trospium chloride. (5.2) •In patients with controlled narrow angle glaucoma Trospium Chloride Tablets should be used only with careful monitoring. (5.4) •Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with Trospium Chloride Tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Trospium Chloride Tablets affect them. (5.5) Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impairment on systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, the risk of anticholinergic adverse reactions is expected to be greater in patients with moderate renal impairment. (5.6) 5.1 Risk of Urinary Retention Trospium Chloride Tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.2 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with trospium chloride, the active ingredient in Trospium Chloride Tablets. In one case, angioedema occurred after the first dose of trospium chloride. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, Trospium Chloride Tablets should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Trospium Chloride Tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ). Trospium Chloride Tablets, like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, intestinal atony and myasthenia gravis. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-angle Glaucoma In patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, Trospium Chloride Tablets should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks and in that circumstance only with careful monitoring [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Trospium Chloride Tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2) ]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Trospium Chloride Tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Patients with Moderate Renal Impairment Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impairment on systemic exposure are not known, but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in patients with moderate renal impairment [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2), and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use with digoxin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug. (7.1) Some drugs which are actively secreted by the kidney may interact with trospium chloride tablets by competing for renal tubular secretion. (7.2) Concomitant use with metformin immediate release tablets reduced exposure and peak concentration of trospium. (7.4) 7.1 Digoxin Concomitant use of trospium chloride tablets and digoxin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Drugs Eliminated by Active Tubular Secretion Although demonstrated in a drug-drug interaction study not to affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, trospium chloride tablets have the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion (e.g., procainamide, pancuronium, morphine, vancomycin, and tenofovir). Co-administration of trospium chloride tablets with these drugs may increase the serum concentration of trospium chloride tablets and/or the coadministered drug due to competition for this elimination pathway. Careful patient monitoring is recommended in patients receiving such drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Antimuscarinic Agents The concomitant use of trospium chloride tablets with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Trospium chloride tablets may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.4 Metformin Co-administration of 500 mg metformin immediate release tablets twice daily with trospium chloride 60 mg extended release tablets reduced the steady-state systemic exposure of trospium by approximately 29% for mean AUC0-24 and by 34% for mean Cmax [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

The safety of trospium chloride tablets was evaluated in controlled clinical trials in a total of 2975 patients, who were treated with trospium chloride tablets (N=1673), placebo (N=1056) or active control medications (N=246). Of this total, 1181 patients participated in two, 12-week, U.S., efficacy and safety studies and a 9-month open-label extension. Of this total, 591 patients received trospium chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily. In all controlled trials combined, 232 and 208 patients received treatment with trospium chloride tablets for at least 24 and 52 weeks, respectively. In all placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidence of serious adverse events was 2.9% among patients receiving trospium chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily and 1.5% among patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists adverse reactions from the combined 12-week U.S. safety and efficacy trials were reported by at least 1% of patients, and were reported more frequently in the trospium chloride group than in the placebo group. The two most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving trospium chloride tablets 20 mg twice daily were dry mouth and constipation. The single most frequently reported adverse reaction for trospium chloride tablets, dry mouth, occurred in 20.1% of trospium chloride treated patients and 5.8% of patients receiving placebo.

The effects of moderate renal impairment on systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, the risk of anticholinergic adverse reactions is expected to be greater in patients with moderate renal impairment. (5.6) 5.1 Risk of Urinary Retention SANCTURA® should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with trospium chloride, the active ingredient in SANCTURA®. In one case, angioedema occurred after the first dose of trospium chloride. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, SANCTURA® should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility SANCTURA® should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. SANCTURA®, like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, intestinal atony and myasthenia gravis. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-angle Glaucoma In patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, SANCTURA® should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks and in that circumstance only with careful monitoring [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects SANCTURA® is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how SANCTURA® affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Patients with Moderate Renal Impairment Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impairment on systemic exposure are not known, but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in patients with moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]."
