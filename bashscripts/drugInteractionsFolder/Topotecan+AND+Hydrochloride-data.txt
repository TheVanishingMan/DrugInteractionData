        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Topotecan is a substrate for both P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Inhibitors of these transporters increase the systemic exposure to oral topotecan. Avoid concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, azithromycin, captopril, carvedilol, clarithromycin, conivaptan, cyclosporine, diltiazem, dronedarone, erythromycin, felodipine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, ritonavir, quercetin, quinidine, ranolazine, ticagrelor, verapamil) and BCRP inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, eltrombopag) with HYCAMTIN capsules [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. -Avoid concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors with HYCAMTIN.

The most common (>=10%) non-hematologic adverse reactions (all grades) were nausea (33%), diarrhea (22%), vomiting (21%), alopecia (20%), and fatigue (19%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of HYCAMTIN capsules was evaluated in 682 patients with lung cancer (3 recurrent small cell lung cancer [SCLC] trials and 1 recurrent non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] trial) who received at least one dose of HYCAMTIN capsules. Patients in all four trials had advanced lung malignancies and received prior chemotherapy in the first-line setting. The dose regimen for HYCAMTIN capsules was 2.3 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days every 21 days. The median number of courses was 3 (range: 1 to 20) in these four trials. Table 2 describes the hematologic and non-hematologic adverse reactions in recurrent SCLC patients treated with HYCAMTIN capsules in the overall lung cancer patient population. Table 2.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Bone marrow suppression: Administer HYCAMTIN only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts. (5.1) Adjust dose as needed. (2.2) -Diarrhea: Severe diarrhea can occur and may require hospitalization. (5.2) Withhold for severe diarrhea. Reduce dose upon recovery. (2.2) -Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Fatal cases have occurred. Permanently discontinue for confirmed ILD. (5.3) -Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is a dose-limiting toxicity of HYCAMTIN. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. The following data on myelosuppression are based on an integrated safety database from 4 thoracic malignancy trials (N = 682) using HYCAMTIN capsules at 2.3 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days. The median day for neutrophil and platelet nadirs occurred on Day 15. Neutropenia: Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) occurred in 32% of patients with a median duration of 7 days and was most common during Course 1 of treatment (20% of patients). Clinical sequelae of neutropenia included infection (17%), febrile neutropenia (4%), sepsis (2%), and septic death (1%). Pancytopenia has been reported. Topotecan can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Thrombocytopenia: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<10,000 cells/mm3) occurred in 6% of patients, with a median duration of 3 days. Anemia: Grade 3 or 4 anemia (<8 g/dL) occurred in 25% of patients. Administer the first course of HYCAMTIN only to patients with a neutrophil count of >=1,500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count >=100,000 cells/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood cell counts frequently during treatment with HYCAMTIN. Refer to Section 2.2 for dose modification guidelines for hematological toxicities in subsequent courses. 5.2 Diarrhea Diarrhea, including severe and life-threatening diarrhea requiring hospitalization, can occur during treatment with HYCAMTIN capsules. Diarrhea caused by HYCAMTIN capsules can occur at the same time as drug-induced neutropenia and its sequelae. In the 682 patients who received HYCAMTIN capsules in the 4 lung cancer trials, the incidence of diarrhea caused by HYCAMTIN capsules was 22%, with 4% Grade 3 and 0.4% Grade 4.The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea proximate (within 5 days) to Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia events in the group receiving HYCAMTIN capsules was 5%. The median time to onset of Grade 2 or worse diarrhea was 9 days in the group receiving HYCAMTIN capsules. Manage diarrhea caused by HYCAMTIN capsules aggressively. Do not administer HYCAMTIN capsules to patients with Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea. Reduce the dose of HYCAMTIN after recovery to Grade 1 or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities, has occurred with HYCAMTIN. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue HYCAMTIN if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity HYCAMTIN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of HYCAMTIN. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking HYCAMTIN [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.7)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not initiate G-CSF until 24 hours after completion of treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Concomitant administration can prolong duration of neutropenia. (7) Greater myelosuppression is likely to be seen when used in combination with other cytotoxic agents. (7) G-CSF: Concomitant administration of G-CSF can prolong the duration of neutropenia, so if G-CSF is to be used, do not initiate it until day 6 of the course of therapy, 24 hours after completion of treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Platinum and Other Cytotoxic Agents: Myelosuppression was more severe when Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection, at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2/day for 5 days, was given in combination with cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 in Phase 1 trials. In one trial, 1 of 3 patients had severe neutropenia for 12 days and a second patient died with neutropenic sepsis. Greater myelosuppression is also likely to be seen when Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection is used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, thereby necessitating a dose reduction. However, when combining Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin), a distinct sequence-dependent interaction on myelosuppression has been reported. Coadministration of a platinum agent on day 1 of dosing with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection required lower doses of each agent compared to co-administration on day 5 of the dosing schedule for Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. For information on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and dosing of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection at a dose of 0.75 mg/m2/day on days 1, 2, and 3 in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 for cervical cancer, see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (5.1) Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease: Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection if the diagnosis is confirmed. (5.3) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. In ovarian cancer, the overall treatment-related death rate was 1%. In the comparative trial in small cell lung cancer, however, the treatment-related death rates were 5% for Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine). Neutropenia: Ovarian and small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia: Ovarian and small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia: Ovarian and small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 3/4 anemia (<8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and Grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function: Administer Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection until neutrophils recover to >1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. [see Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1)]. 5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection has been observed, most reactions have been mild, but severe cases have been reported."

Grade 3/4 elevations occurred in 4%. Grade 3/4 elevated bilirubin occurred in less than 2% of patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of topotecan. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to topotecan. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Severe bleeding (in association with thrombocytopenia) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Immune System Disorders Allergic manifestations, anaphylactoid reactions. Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain potentially associated with neutropenic enterocolitis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Pulmonary Disorders Interstitial lung disease [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Angioedema, severe dermatitis, severe pruritus. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Extravasation [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Bone marrow suppression: Administer topotecan injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose as needed. (2.2, 5.1) -Neutropenic enterocolitis: Fatal typhlitis can occur. (5.2) -Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Fatal cases have occurred. Permanently discontinue for confirmed ILD. (5.3) -Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1, 8.3) -Extravasation and tissue injury: Severe cases have been reported. If extravasation occurs, immediately stop administration and institute recommended management procedures. (5.5) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. -The following data on myelosuppression are based on an integrated safety database from 8 trials (N = 879) using topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21-day course in patients with ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer and from one trial in patients with cervical cancer (N = 147) using topotecan 0.75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily on Days 1, 2, and 3 repeated every 21 days in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on Day 1. Neutropenia -Monotherapy: Grade 4 neutropenia (less than 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 78% of patients, with a median duration of 7 days and was most common during Course 1 of treatment (58% of patients). Grade 4 neutropenia associated with infection occurred in 13% of patients and febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% of patients. Sepsis occurred in 4% of patients and was fatal in 1% of patients. Pancytopenia has been reported. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 48% of patients. Thrombocytopenia -Monotherapy: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (less than 25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients, with a median duration of 5 days. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 7% of patients. Anemia -Monotherapy: Grade 3 or 4 anemia (less than 8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 3 or Grade 4 anemia occurred in 40% of patients. Administer Topotecan injection only to patients with a baseline neutrophil count of greater than or equal to 1,500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with Topotecan injection. Refer to Section 2.4 for dose modification guidelines for hematological toxicities in subsequent courses. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of Topotecan injection until neutrophils recover to greater than 1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to greater than 100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). 5.2 Neutropenic Enterocolitis Topotecan can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities, has occurred with Topotecan. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue Topotecan injection if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on animal data, Topotecan injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of Topotecan. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.5 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation with topotecan has been observed; severe cases have been reported. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of Topotecan and institute recommended management procedures [see Adverse Reactions (6) ].",

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not initiate G-CSF until 24 hours after completion of treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Concomitant administration can prolong duration of neutropenia. (7) Greater myelosuppression is likely to be seen when used in combination with other cytotoxic agents. (7) G-CSF: Concomitant administration of G-CSF can prolong the duration of neutropenia, so if G-CSF is to be used, do not initiate it until day 6 of the course of therapy, 24 hours after completion of treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Platinum and Other Cytotoxic Agents: Myelosuppression was more severe when Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection, at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2/day for 5 days, was given in combination with cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 in Phase 1 studies. In one study, 1 of 3 patients had severe neutropenia for 12 days and a second patient died with neutropenic sepsis. Greater myelosuppression is also likely to be seen when Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection is used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, thereby necessitating a dose reduction. However, when combining Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin), a distinct sequence-dependent interaction on myelosuppression has been reported. Coadministration of a platinum agent on day 1 of dosing with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection required lower doses of each agent compared to co-administration on day 5 of the dosing schedule for Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. For information on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and dosing of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection at a dose of 0.75 mg/m2/day on days 1, 2, and 3 in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 for cervical cancer, see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (5.1) Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease: Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection if the diagnosis is confirmed. (5.3) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. In the comparative study in small cell lung cancer, however, the treatment-related death rates were 5% for Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine). Neutropenia Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 3/4 anemia (<8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function Administer Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection until neutrophils recover to >1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. [see Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1)]. 5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection has been observed, most reactions have been mild but severe cases have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Bone marrow suppression: Administer HYCAMTIN only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose as needed. (2.4, 5.1) -Neutropenic enterocolitis: Fatal typhlitis can occur. (5.2) -Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Fatal cases have occurred. Permanently discontinue for confirmed ILD. (5.3) -Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1, 8.3) -Extravasation and tissue injury: Severe cases have been reported. If extravasation occurs, immediately stop administration and institute recommended management procedures. (5.5) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of HYCAMTIN. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when HYCAMTIN is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. -The following data on myelosuppression are based on an integrated safety database from 8 trials (N = 879) using HYCAMTIN injection at 1.5 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21-day course in patients with ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer and from one trial in patients with cervical cancer (N = 147) using HYCAMTIN 0.75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily on Days 1, 2, and 3 repeated every 21 days in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on Day 1. Neutropenia -Monotherapy: Grade 4 neutropenia (less than 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 78% of patients, with a median duration of 7 days and was most common during Course 1 of treatment (58% of patients). Grade 4 neutropenia associated with infection occurred in 13% of patients and febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% of patients. Sepsis occurred in 4% of patients and was fatal in 1% of patients. Pancytopenia has been reported. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 48% of patients. Thrombocytopenia -Monotherapy: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (less than 25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients, with a median duration of 5 days. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 7% of patients. Anemia -Monotherapy: Grade 3 or 4 anemia (less than 8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 3 or Grade 4 anemia occurred in 40% of patients. Administer HYCAMTIN only to patients with a baseline neutrophil count of greater than or equal to 1,500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with HYCAMTIN. Refer to Section 2.4 for dose modification guidelines for hematological toxicities in subsequent courses. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of HYCAMTIN until neutrophils recover to greater than 1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to greater than 100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). 5.2 Neutropenic Enterocolitis Topotecan can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities, has occurred with HYCAMTIN. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue HYCAMTIN if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on animal data, HYCAMTIN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of HYCAMTIN. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.5 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation with HYCAMTIN has been observed; severe cases have been reported. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of HYCAMTIN and institute recommended management procedures [see Adverse Reactions (6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS G-CSF: Concomitant administration of G-CSF can prolong the duration of neutropenia, so if G-CSF is to be used, do not initiate it until day 6 of the course of therapy, 24 hours after completion of treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Platinum and Other Cytotoxic Agents: Myelosuppression was more severe when topotecan hydrochloride, at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2/day for 5 days, was given in combination with cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 in Phase 1 studies. In one study, 1 of 3 patients had severe neutropenia for 12 days and a second patient died with neutropenic sepsis. Greater myelosuppression is also likely to be seen when topotecan hydrochloride is used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, thereby necessitating a dose reduction. However, when combining topotecan hydrochloride with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin), a distinct sequence-dependent interaction on myelosuppression has been reported. Coadministration of a platinum agent on day 1 of dosing with topotecan hydrochloride required lower doses of each agent compared to co-administration on day 5 of the dosing schedule for topotecan hydrochloride. For information on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and dosing of topotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 0.75 mg/m2/day on days 1, 2, and 3 in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 for cervical cancer, see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14). Do not initiate G-CSF until 24 hours after completion of treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Concomitant administration can prolong duration of neutropenia.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer topotecan hydrochloride only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (5.1) Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease: topotecan hydrochloride has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride if the diagnosis is confirmed. (5.3) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan hydrochloride. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. In the comparative study in small cell lung cancer, the treatment-related death rates were 5% for topotecan hydrochloride and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine). Neutropenia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 3/4 anemia (<8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function: Administer topotecan hydrochloride only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of topotecan hydrochloride until neutrophils recover to >1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan hydrochloride is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan hydrochloride. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan hydrochloride has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Topotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of topotecan hydrochloride in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving topotecan hydrochloride, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1)]. 5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation with topotecan hydrochloride has been observed, most reactions have been mild but severe cases have been reported."

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to Topotecan Injection. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Severe bleeding (in association with thrombocytopenia). [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Immune System Disorders: Allergic manifestations; Anaphylactoid reactions. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain potentially associated with neutropenic colitis. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Pulmonary Disorders: Interstitial lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, severe dermatitis, severe pruritus General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Inadvertent extravasation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer Topotecan Injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (5.1) Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease: topotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue Topotecan Injection if the diagnosis is confirmed. (5.3) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of Topotecan Injection. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. In the comparative study, in small cell lung cancer, the treatment-related death rates were 5% for topotecan and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine). Neutropenia From a combined experience of patients receiving topotecan which included patients treated for small cell lung cancer: Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia From a combined experience of patients receiving topotecan which included patients treated for small cell lung cancer: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia From a combined experience of patients receiving topotecan which included patients treated for small cell lung cancer: Grade 3/4 anemia (<8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function Administer Topotecan Injection only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with Topotecan Injection. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of Topotecan Injection until neutrophils recover to >1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when Topotecan Injection is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with Topotecan Injection. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan Injection has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue Topotecan Injection if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Topotecan Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of Topotecan Injection in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving Topotecan Injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. [see Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1)] 5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation with topotecan has been observed, most reactions have been mild but severe cases have been reported."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS G-CSF: Concomitant administration of G-CSF can prolong the duration of neutropenia, so if G-CSF is to be used, do not initiate it until day 6 of the course of therapy, 24 hours after completion of treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Platinum and other Cytotoxic Agents: Myelosuppression was more severe when Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection, at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2/day for 5 days, was given in combination with cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 in Phase 1 studies. In one study, 1 of 3 patients had severe neutropenia for 12 days and a second patient died with neutropenic sepsis. Greater myelosuppression is also likely to be seen when Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection is used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, thereby necessitating a dose reduction. However, when combining Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin), a distinct sequence-dependent interaction on myelosuppression has been reported. Coadministration of a platinum agent on day 1 of dosing with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection required lower doses of each agent compared to co-administration on day 5 of the dosing scheduling for Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. For information on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and dosing of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection at a dose of 0.75 mg/m2/day on days 1, 2 and 3 in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 for cervical cancer, see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14). Do not initiate G-CSF until 24 hours after completion of treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Concomitant administration can prolong duration of neutropenia. (7) Greater myelosuppression is likely to be seen when used in combination with other cytotoxic agents.(7)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (5.1) Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease. Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection if the diagnosis is confirmed. (5.3) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. In the comparative study in small cell lung cancer, however, the treatment-related deaths were 5% for Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine). Neutropenia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 3/4 anemia (<8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function: Administer Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection until neutrophils recover to >1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection is used in combination with cisplatin. [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been fatal. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. [see Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1)]. 5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection has been observed, most reactions have been mild but severe cases have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer topotecan hydrochloride for injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose as needed. ( 2.4, 5.1) Neutropenic enterocolitis: Fatal typhlitis can occur. ( 5.2) Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Fatal cases have occurred. Permanently discontinue for confirmed ILD. ( 5.3) Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. ( 5.4, 8.1, 8.3) Extravasation and tissue injury: Severe cases have been reported. If extravasation occurs, immediately stop administration and institute recommended management procedures. ( 5.5) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan hydrochloride for injection is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)] . The following data on myelosuppression are based on an integrated safety database from 8 trials (N = 879) using topotecan hydrochloride for injection at 1.5 mg/m 2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21-day course in patients with ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer and from one trial in patients with cervical cancer (N = 147) using topotecan hydrochloride for injection 0.75 mg/m 2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily on Days 1, 2, and 3 repeated every 21 days in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m 2 on Day 1. Neutropenia Monotherapy: Grade 4 neutropenia (less than 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 78% of patients, with a median duration of 7 days and was most common during Course 1 of treatment (58% of patients). Grade 4 neutropenia associated with infection occurred in 13% of patients and febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% of patients. Sepsis occurred in 4% of patients and was fatal in 1% of patients. Pancytopenia has been reported. Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 48% of patients. Thrombocytopenia Monotherapy: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (less than 25,000/mm 3) occurred in 27% of patients, with a median duration of 5 days. Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 7% of patients. Anemia Monotherapy: Grade 3 or 4 anemia (less than 8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients. Combination with cisplatin: Grade 3 or Grade 4 anemia occurred in 40% of patients. Administer topotecan hydrochloride for injection only to patients with a baseline neutrophil count of greater than or equal to 1,500 cells/mm 3 and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm 3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Refer to Section 2.4 for dose modification guidelines for hematological toxicities in subsequent courses. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of topotecan hydrochloride for injection until neutrophils recover to greater than 1,000 cells/mm 3, platelets recover to greater than 100,000 cells/mm 3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). 5.2 Neutropenic Enterocolitis Topotecan can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities, has occurred with topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride for injection if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on animal data, topotecan hydrochloride for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1, 8.3)]. 5.5 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation with topotecan hydrochloride for injection has been observed; severe cases have been reported. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of topotecan hydrochloride for injection and institute recommended management procedures [see Adverse Reactions (6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS G-CSF Concomitant administration of G-CSF can prolong the duration of neutropenia, so if G-CSF is to be used, do not initiate it until day 6 of the course of therapy, 24 hours after completion of treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Platinum and Other Cytotoxic Agents Myelosuppression was more severe when topotecan hydrochloride, at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2/day for 5 days, was given in combination with cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 in Phase 1 studies. In one study, 1 of 3 patients had severe neutropenia for 12 days and a second patient died with neutropenic sepsis. Greater myelosuppression is also likely to be seen when topotecan hydrochloride is used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, thereby necessitating a dose reduction. However, when combining topotecan hydrochloride with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin), a distinct sequence-dependent interaction on myelosuppression has been reported. Co-administration of a platinum agent on day 1 of dosing with topotecan hydrochloride required lower doses of each agent compared to co-administration on day 5 of the dosing schedule for topotecan hydrochloride.For information on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and dosing of topotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 0.75 mg/m2/day on days 1, 2, and 3 in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 for cervical cancer [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14) ]. Do not initiate G-CSF until 24 hours after completion of treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Concomitant administration can prolong duration of neutropenia.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer topotecan hydrochloride only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (5.1) Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease: Topotecan hydrochloride has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride if the diagnosis is confirmed. (5.3) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan hydrochloride. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. In the comparative study, in small cell lung cancer, the treatment-related death rates were 5% for topotecan hydrochloride and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine). Neutropenia Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 3/4 anemia (<8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function Administer topotecan hydrochloride only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of topotecan hydrochloride until neutrophils recover to >1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan hydrochloride is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan hydrochloride. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan hydrochloride has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Topotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of topotecan hydrochloride in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving topotecan hydrochloride, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1)]. 5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation with topotecan hydrochloride has been observed, most reactions have been mild but severe cases have been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Bone marrow suppression: Administer topotecan only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose as needed. (2.3, 5.1) -Neutropenic enterocolitis: Fatal typhlitis can occur. (5.2) -Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Fatal cases have occurred. Permanently discontinue for confirmed ILD. (5.3) -Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1, 8.3) -Extravasation and tissue injury: Severe cases have been reported. If extravasation occurs, immediately stop administration and institute recommended management procedures. (5.5) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. -The following data on myelosuppression are based on an integrated safety database from 8 trials (N = 879) using topotecan injection at 1.5 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21-day course in patients with ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer and from one trial in patients with cervical cancer (N = 147) using topotecan 0.75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily on Days 1, 2, and 3 repeated every 21 days in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on Day 1. Neutropenia -Monotherapy: Grade 4 neutropenia (less than 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 78% of patients, with a median duration of 7 days and was most common during Course 1 of treatment (58% of patients). Grade 4 neutropenia associated with infection occurred in 13% of patients and febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% of patients. Sepsis occurred in 4% of patients and was fatal in 1% of patients. Pancytopenia has been reported. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 48% of patients. Thrombocytopenia -Monotherapy: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (less than 25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients, with a median duration of 5 days. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 7% of patients. Anemia -Monotherapy: Grade 3 or 4 anemia (less than 8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 3 or Grade 4 anemia occurred in 40% of patients. Administer topotecan only to patients with a baseline neutrophil count of greater than or equal to 1,500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with topotecan. Refer to Section 2.3 for dose modification guidelines for hematological toxicities in subsequent courses. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of topotecan until neutrophils recover to greater than 1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to greater than 100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). 5.2 Neutropenic Enterocolitis Topotecan can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities, has occurred with topotecan. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on animal data, topotecan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of topotecan. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.5 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation with topotecan has been observed; severe cases have been reported. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of topotecan and institute recommended management procedures [see Adverse Reactions (6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS G-CSF: Concomitant administration of G-CSF can prolong the duration of neutropenia, so if G-CSF is to be used, do not initiate it until day 6 of the course of therapy, 24 hours after completion of treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Platinum and Other Cytotoxic Agents: Myelosuppression was more severe when topotecan hydrochloride, at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2/day for 5 days, was given in combination with cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 in Phase 1 trials. In one trial, 1 of 3 patients had severe neutropenia for 12 days and a second patient died with neutropenic sepsis. Greater myelosuppression is also likely to be seen when topotecan hydrochloride is used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, thereby necessitating a dose reduction. However, when combining topotecan hydrochloride with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin), a distinct sequence-dependent interaction on myelosuppression has been reported. Coadministration of a platinum agent on day 1 of dosing with topotecan hydrochloride required lower doses of each agent compared to coadministration on day 5 of the dosing schedule for topotecan hydrochloride. For information on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and dosing of topotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 0.75 mg/m2/day on days 1, 2, and 3 in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 for cervical cancer, [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)]. Do not initiate G-CSF until 24 hours after completion of treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Concomitant administration can prolong duration of neutropenia.

In the comparative trial in small cell lung cancer, however, the treatment-related death rates were 5% for topotecan hydrochloride and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine). Neutropenia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 neutropenia (less than 500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (less than 25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 3/4 anemia (less than 8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and Grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function: Administer topotecan hydrochloride only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of topotecan hydrochloride until neutrophils recover to greater than 1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to greater than 100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan hydrochloride is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan hydrochloride. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan hydrochloride has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D. Topotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of topotecan hydrochloride in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving topotecan hydrochloride, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus, [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation with topotecan hydrochloride has been observed; most reactions have been mild, but severe cases have been reported."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS G-CSF: Concomitant administration of G-CSF can prolong the duration of neutropenia, so if G-CSF is to be used, do not initiate it until day 6 of the course of therapy, 24 hours after completion of treatment with topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Platinum and Other Cytotoxic Agents: Myelosuppression was more severe when topotecan hydrochloride for injection, at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2/day for 5 days, was given in combination with cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 in Phase 1 trials. In one trial, 1 of 3 patients had severe neutropenia for 12 days and a second patient died with neutropenic sepsis. Greater myelosuppression is also likely to be seen when topotecan hydrochloride for injection is used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, thereby necessitating a dose reduction. However, when combining topotecan hydrochloride for injection with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin), a distinct sequence-dependent interaction on myelosuppression has been reported. Coadministration of a platinum agent on day 1 of dosing with topotecan hydrochloride for injection required lower doses of each agent compared to coadministration on day 5 of the dosing schedule for topotecan hydrochloride for injection. For information on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and dosing of topotecan hydrochloride for injection at a dose of 0.75 mg/m2/day on days 1, 2, and 3 in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 for cervical cancer, see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14). Do not initiate G-CSF until 24 hours after completion of treatment with topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Concomitant administration can prolong duration of neutropenia.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer topotecan hydrochloride for injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (5.1) Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease: Topotecan hydrochloride for injection has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride for injection if the diagnosis is confirmed. (5.3) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. In the comparative trial in small cell lung cancer, however, the treatment-related death rates were 5% for topotecan hydrochloride for injection and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine). Neutropenia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia:Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 3/4 anemia (<8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and Grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function: Administer topotecan hydrochloride for injection only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of topotecan hydrochloride for injection until neutrophils recover to >1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan hydrochloride for injection is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan hydrochloride for injection. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan hydrochloride for injection has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride for injection if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Topotecan hydrochloride for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of topotecan hydrochloride for injection in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving topotecan hydrochloride for injection, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation with topotecan hydrochloride for injection has been observed, most reactions have been mild, but severe cases have been reported."

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to topotecan hydrochloride. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Severe bleeding (in association with thrombocytopenia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Immune System Disorders: Allergic manifestations; Anaphylactoid reactions. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain potentially associated with neutropenic colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Pulmonary Disorders: Interstitial lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, severe dermatitis, severe pruritus. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Inadvertent extravasation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer topotecan hydrochloride only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (5.1) Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease: Topotecan hydrochloride has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride if the diagnosis is confirmed. (5.3) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan hydrochloride. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. In the comparative study, in small cell lung cancer, the treatment-related death rates were 5% for topotecan hydrochloride and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine). Neutropenia Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 3/4 anemia (<8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function Administer topotecan hydrochloride only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of topotecan hydrochloride until neutrophils recover to >1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan hydrochloride is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan hydrochloride. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan hydrochloride has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Topotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of topotecan hydrochloride in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving topotecan hydrochloride, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations , Pregnancy (8.1) ] . 5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation with topotecan hydrochloride has been observed, most reactions have been mild but severe cases have been reported.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not initiate G-CSF until 24 hours after completion of treatment with Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection. Concomitant administration can prolong duration of neutropenia. (7) Greater myelosuppression is likely to be seen when used in combination with other cytotoxic agents. (7) G-CSF: Concomitant administration of G-CSF can prolong the duration of neutropenia, so if G-CSF is to be used, do not initiate it until day 6 of the course of therapy, 24 hours after completion of treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Platinum and Other Cytotoxic Agents: Myelosuppression was more severe when topotecan hydrochloride, at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2/day for 5 days, was given in combination with cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 in Phase 1 studies. In one study, 1 of 3 patients had severe neutropenia for 12 days and a second patient died with neutropenic sepsis. Greater myelosuppression is also likely to be seen when topotecan hydrochloride is used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, thereby necessitating a dose reduction. However, when combining topotecan hydrochloride with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin), a distinct sequence-dependent interaction on myelosuppression has been reported. Coadministration of a platinum agent on day 1 of dosing with topotecan hydrochloride required lower doses of each agent compared to co-administration on day 5 of the dosing schedule for topotecan hydrochloride. For information on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and dosing of topotecan hydrochloride at a dose of 0.75 mg/m2/day on days 1, 2, and 3 in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 for cervical cancer, see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (5.1) Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease: Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection if the diagnosis is confirmed. (5.3) Pregnancy: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan hydrochloride. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. In the comparative study in small cell lung cancer, however, the treatment-related death rates were 5% for topotecan hydrochloride and 4% for CAV (cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine). Neutropenia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Pancytopenia has been reported. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia: Small cell lung cancer experience: Grade 3/4 anemia (<8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Monitoring of Bone Marrow Function: Administer topotecan hydrochloride only in patients with adequate bone marrow reserves, including baseline neutrophil count of at least 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with topotecan hydrochloride. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of topotecan hydrochloride until neutrophils recover to >1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan hydrochloride is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan hydrochloride. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan hydrochloride has been associated with reports of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of which have been fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Topotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of topotecan hydrochloride in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving topotecan hydrochloride, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1)]. 5.5 Inadvertent Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation with topotecan hydrochloride has been observed, most reactions have been mild but severe cases have been reported."

Grade 3/4 elevations occurred in 4%. Grade 3/4 elevated bilirubin occurred in less than 2% of patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of topotecan. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to topotecan. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Severe bleeding (in association with thrombocytopenia) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Immune System Disorders Allergic manifestations, anaphylactoid reactions. Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain potentially associated with neutropenic enterocolitis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Pulmonary Disorders Interstitial lung disease [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Angioedema, severe dermatitis, severe pruritus. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Extravasation [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Bone marrow suppression: Administer topotecan injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose as needed. (2.2, 5.1) -Neutropenic enterocolitis: Fatal typhlitis can occur. (5.2) -Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Fatal cases have occurred. Permanently discontinue for confirmed ILD. (5.3) -Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1, 8.3) -Extravasation and tissue injury: Severe cases have been reported. If extravasation occurs, immediately stop administration and institute recommended management procedures. (5.5) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. -The following data on myelosuppression are based on an integrated safety database from 8 trials (N = 879) using topotecan at 1.5 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21-day course in patients with ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer and from one trial in patients with cervical cancer (N = 147) using topotecan 0.75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily on Days 1, 2, and 3 repeated every 21 days in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on Day 1. Neutropenia -Monotherapy: Grade 4 neutropenia (less than 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 78% of patients, with a median duration of 7 days and was most common during Course 1 of treatment (58% of patients). Grade 4 neutropenia associated with infection occurred in 13% of patients and febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% of patients. Sepsis occurred in 4% of patients and was fatal in 1% of patients. Pancytopenia has been reported. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 48% of patients. Thrombocytopenia -Monotherapy: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (less than 25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients, with a median duration of 5 days. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 7% of patients. Anemia -Monotherapy: Grade 3 or 4 anemia (less than 8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients. -Combination with cisplatin: Grade 3 or Grade 4 anemia occurred in 40% of patients. Administer Topotecan injection only to patients with a baseline neutrophil count of greater than or equal to 1,500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with Topotecan injection. Refer to Section 2.4 for dose modification guidelines for hematological toxicities in subsequent courses. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of Topotecan injection until neutrophils recover to greater than 1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to greater than 100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). 5.2 Neutropenic Enterocolitis Topotecan can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities, has occurred with Topotecan. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue Topotecan injection if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on animal data, Topotecan injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of Topotecan. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.5 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation with topotecan has been observed; severe cases have been reported. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of Topotecan and institute recommended management procedures [see Adverse Reactions (6) ].",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer topotecan only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose if needed. (5.1) Neutropenia colitis, in some cases fatal, can occur. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease: Topotecan can cause interstitial lung disease. Monitor patients for symptoms and discontinue topotecan if the diagnosis is confirmed. (5.3) Embryofetal Toxicity: Topotecan can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to a fetus. (5.4, 8.1) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Severe and life-threatening bone marrow suppression, resulting in neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan, observed in approximately 50%-75% of patients across clinical trials. Pancytopenia has been reported. In clinical trials, neutropenia resulting in death due to infection or sepsis ranged from 1-4% across clinical studies. Neutropenia: Small cell lung cancer and other malignancies experience: Grade 4 neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) was most common during course 1 of treatment (60% of patients) and occurred in 39% of all courses, with a median duration of 7 days. The nadir neutrophil count occurred at a median of 12 days. Therapy-related sepsis or febrile neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, and sepsis was fatal in 1%. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia affected 26% and 48% of patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia: Small cell lung cancer and other malignancies experience: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (< 25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients and in 9% of courses, with a median duration of 5 days and platelet nadir at a median of 15 days. Platelet transfusions were given to 15% of patients in 4% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia affected 26% and 7% of patients, respectively. Anemia: Small cell lung cancer and other malignancies experience: Grade 3/4 anemia (< 8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients and in 14% of courses. Median nadir was at day 15. Transfusions were needed in 52% of patients in 22% of courses. Cervical cancer experience: Grade 3 and grade 4 anemia affected 34% and 6% of patients, respectively. Do not initiate topotecan treatment in patients with a neutrophil count of less than 1,500 cells/mm3 or a platelet count less than 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with topotecan. Delay subsequent cycles of topotecan until neutrophils recover to > 1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to > 100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9.0 g/dL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 )]. 5.2 Neutropenic Colitis Topotecan-induced neutropenia can lead to neutropenic colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been reported in clinical trials with topotecan. In patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Topotecan treatment can result in interstitial lung disease (ILD), some cases of ILD have been fatal based on post-marketing reports of serious adverse reactions. Underlying risk factors for development of ILD with topotecan include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity Topotecan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of topotecan in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving topotecan, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.5 Extravasation Inadvertent extravasation of topotecan can result in severe injury to local tissues based on post-marketing reports of serious adverse reactions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bone marrow suppression: Administer topotecan hydrochloride for injection only to patients with adequate bone marrow reserves. Monitor peripheral blood counts and adjust the dose as needed. (2.4, 5.1) Neutropenic enterocolitis: Fatal typhlitis can occur. (5.2) Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Fatal cases have occurred. Permanently discontinue for confirmed ILD. (5.3) Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (5.4, 8.1, 8.3) Extravasation and tissue injury: Severe cases have been reported. If extravasation occurs, immediately stop administration and institute recommended management procedures. (5.5) 5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is the dose-limiting toxicity of topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Neutropenia is not cumulative over time. Severe myelotoxicity has been reported when topotecan hydrochloride for injection is used in combination with cisplatin [see Drug Interactions (7)]. The following data on myelosuppression are based on an integrated safety database from 8 trials (N = 879) using topotecan hydrochloride for injection at 1.5 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21-day course in patients with ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer and from one trial in patients with cervical cancer (N = 147) using topotecan hydrochloride for injection 0.75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily on Days 1, 2, and 3 repeated every 21 days in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on Day 1. Neutropenia Monotherapy: Grade 4 neutropenia (less than 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 78% of patients, with a median duration of 7 days and was most common during Course 1 of treatment (58% of patients). Grade 4 neutropenia associated with infection occurred in 13% of patients and febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% of patients. Sepsis occurred in 4% of patients and was fatal in 1% of patients. Pancytopenia has been reported. Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 48% of patients. Thrombocytopenia Monotherapy: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (less than 25,000/mm3) occurred in 27% of patients, with a median duration of 5 days. Combination with cisplatin: Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 7% of patients. Anemia Monotherapy: Grade 3 or 4 anemia (less than 8 g/dL) occurred in 37% of patients. Combination with cisplatin: Grade 3 or Grade 4 anemia occurred in 40% of patients. Administer topotecan hydrochloride for injection only to patients with a baseline neutrophil count of greater than or equal to 1,500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3. Monitor peripheral blood counts frequently during treatment with topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Refer to Section 2.4 for dose modification guidelines for hematological toxicities in subsequent courses. Do not treat patients with subsequent courses of topotecan hydrochloride for injection until neutrophils recover to greater than 1,000 cells/mm3, platelets recover to greater than 100,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin levels recover to 9 g/dL (with transfusion if necessary). 5.2 Neutropenic Enterocolitis Topotecan can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities, has occurred with topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD (e.g., cough, fever, dyspnea, and/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan hydrochloride for injection if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on animal data, topotecan hydrochloride for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of topotecan hydrochloride for injection. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. 5.5 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation with topotecan hydrochloride for injection has been observed; severe cases have been reported. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of topotecan hydrochloride for injection and institute recommended management procedures [see Adverse Reactions (6)]."
