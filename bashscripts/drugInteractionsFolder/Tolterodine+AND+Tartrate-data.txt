(7.6) 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate-release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1) ]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean Cmax and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence >=4% and >placebo) were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Greenstone LLC at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The efficacy and safety of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules was evaluated in 1073 patients (537 assigned to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules 4 mg once daily.

Similar percentages of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules or placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal: diarrhea; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. (5.1) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.2) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. (5.3) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.4) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affect them (5.5). Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. (5.8) QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. (5.9) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate-release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate-release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ], the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

        "Drug-Drug Interactions Fluoxetine Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate-release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate-release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when DETROL and fluoxetine are coadministered. Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Tolterodine immediate-release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate-release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate-release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 μM), while tolterodine immediate-release as well as the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes. CYP3A4 Inhibitors The effect of 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate-release was studied in eight healthy volunteers, all of whom were poor metabolizers (see Pharmacokinetics: Variability in Metabolism for discussion of poor metabolizers). In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean Cmax and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate-release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate-release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levonorgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2-month cycle in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate-release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tartrate tablets included 3,071 patients who were treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets (N = 2,133) or placebo (N = 938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine tartrate tablets were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Potent CYP2D6 InhibitorsFluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1) ]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.2 Potent CYP3A4 InhibitorsKetoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean Cmax and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin or ritonavir, the recommended dose of DETROL LA is 2 mg once daily [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.3 Other interactionsNo clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] 7.4 Other drugs metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.5 Drug-Laboratory-Test InteractionsInteractions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. 7.6 Other AnticholinergicsThe concomitant use of DETROL LA with other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, somnolence and other anticholienrgic pharmacological effects."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 6.1 Clinical Trials ExperienceThe efficacy and safety of DETROL LA Capsules was evaluated in 1073 patients (537 assigned to DETROL LA; 536 assigned to placebo) who were treated with 2, 4, 6, or 8 mg/day for up to 15 months. These include a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to DETROL LA 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving DETROL LA and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving DETROL LA were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with DETROL LA occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with DETROL LA and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving DETROL LA and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo. Table 1 lists the adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study at an incidence greater than placebo and in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with DETROL LA 4 mg once daily.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Urinary RetentionAdminister DETROL LA Capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.2 Gastrointestinal DisordersAdminister DETROL LA with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. DETROL LA, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g. intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.3 Controlled Narrow-Angle GlaucomaAdminister DETROL LA with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.4 Hepatic ImpairmentThe clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for DETROL LA is 2 mg once daily. DETROL LA is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ]. 5.5 Renal ImpairmentRenal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of DETROL LA should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min). Patients with CCr less than 10 mL/min have not been studied and use of DETROL LA in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) , and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ]. 5.6 Myasthenia GravisAdminister DETROL LA with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.7 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT ProlongationIn a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ] the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe DETROL LA to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with DETROL or DETROL LA."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. (5.1) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.2) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. (5.3) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.4) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affect them (5.5). Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. (5.8) QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. (5.9) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention.

Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate-release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsulesare not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites.

        "Drug-Drug Interactions Fluoxetine Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate-release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate-release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when DETROL and fluoxetine are coadministered. Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Tolterodine immediate-release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate-release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate-release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 μM), while tolterodine immediate-release as well as the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes. CYP3A4 Inhibitors The effect of 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate-release was studied in eight healthy volunteers, all of whom were poor metabolizers (see Pharmacokinetics: Variability in Metabolism for discussion of poor metabolizers). In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean Cmax and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate-release 4 mg (2 mg bid) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate-release 4 mg (2 mg bid) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levonorgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2-month cycle in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate-release up to 8 mg (4 mg bid) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tartrate tablets included 3,071 patients who were treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets (N = 2,133) or placebo (N = 938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine tartrate tablets were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid.

The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine tartrate were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine tartrate 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of DETROL LA. (5.1) -Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.2) -Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. (5.3) -Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.4) -Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with Detrol LA. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Detrol LA affects them (5.5). -Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. (5.8) -QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe DETROL LA to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. (5.9) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of DETROL LA. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, DETROL LA should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer DETROL LA Capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer DETROL LA with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. DETROL LA, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer DETROL LA with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.5Central Nervous System Effects Detrol LA is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for DETROL LA is 2 mg once daily. DETROL LA is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of DETROL LA should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of DETROL LA in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer DETROL LA with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ], the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe DETROL LA to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with DETROL or DETROL LA."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. (5.1) -Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.2) -Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. (5.3) -Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.4) -Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules affect them. (5.5) -Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. (5.8) -QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. (5.9) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate-release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules is 2 mg once daily. Tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules are not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10 to 30 mL/min). Patients with CCr < 10 mL/min have not been studied and use of tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules in this population is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (2 times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after 4 days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules."

These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to DETROL LA 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving DETROL LA and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving DETROL LA were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with DETROL LA, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with DETROL LA and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents.

        "Drug-Drug Interactions Fluoxetine Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. In a study to assess the effect of fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release and its metabolites, it was observed that fluoxetine significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite. Fluoxetine thus alters the pharmacokinetics in patients who would otherwise be extensive metabolizers of tolterodine immediate release to resemble the pharmacokinetic profile in poor metabolizers. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine immediate release and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine tartrate and fluoxetine are coadministered. Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes Tolterodine immediate release does not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the major drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole. In vitro data show that tolterodine immediate release is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6 at high concentrations (Ki 1.05 µM), while tolterodine immediate release as well as the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolites are devoid of any significant inhibitory potential regarding the other isoenzymes. CYP3A4 Inhibitors The effect of 200 mg daily dose of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine immediate release was studied in 8 healthy volunteers, all of whom were poor metabolizers (see Pharmacokinetics, Variability in Metabolism for discussion of poor metabolizers). In the presence of ketoconazole, the mean Cmax and AUC of tolterodine increased by 2 and 2.5 fold, respectively. Based on these findings, other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine may also lead to increases of tolterodine plasma concentrations (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Warfarin In healthy volunteers, coadministration of tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg b.i.d.) for 7 days and a single dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 4 had no effect on prothrombin time, Factor VII suppression, or on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Oral Contraceptives Tolterodine immediate release 4 mg (2 mg b.i.d.) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg/levonorgestrel 150 mcg) as evidenced by the monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel over a 2 month cycle in healthy female volunteers. Diuretics Coadministration of tolterodine immediate release up to 8 mg (4 mg b.i.d.) for up to 12 weeks with diuretic agents, such as indapamide, hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene, bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, methylchlorothiazide, or furosemide, did not cause any adverse electrocardiographic (ECG) effects.",

The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine tartrate 2 mg b.i.d. in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies.

These included a total of 1012 patients (505 randomized to DETROL LA 4 mg once daily and 507 randomized to placebo) enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week clinical efficacy and safety study. Adverse events were reported in 52% (n=263) of patients receiving DETROL LA and in 49% (n=247) of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving DETROL LA were dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with DETROL LA, occurring in 23.4% of patients treated with DETROL LA and 7.7% of placebo-treated patients. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. A serious adverse event was reported by 1.4% (n=7) of patients receiving DETROL LA and by 3.6% (n=18) of patients receiving placebo.

Dry mouth was the most common adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation among patients receiving DETROL LA [n=12 (2.4%) vs. placebo n=6 (1.2%)]. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide post-marketing experience: General: anaphylaxis and angioedema; Cardiovascular: tachycardia, palpitations, peripheral edema; Gastrointestinal: diarrhea; Central/Peripheral Nervous: confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g., confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of DETROL LA. (5.1) Urinary Retention: use caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.2) Gastrointestinal Disorders: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders or decreased gastrointestinal motility because of the risk of gastric retention. (5.3) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: use caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.4) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with Detrol LA. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Detrol LA affects them (5.5). Myasthenia Gravis: use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. (5.8) QT Prolongation: consider observations from the thorough QT study in clinical decisions to prescribe DETROL LA to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. (5.9) 5.1 Angioedema Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of DETROL LA. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, DETROL LA should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention Administer DETROL LA Capsules with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders Administer DETROL LA with caution in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention. DETROL LA, like other antimuscarinic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility (e.g., intestinal atony) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Administer DETROL LA with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) ]. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Detrol LA is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] including dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of orally administered tolterodine immediate release was substantially lower in cirrhotic patients than in the healthy volunteers. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), the recommended dose for DETROL LA is 2 mg once daily. DETROL LA is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Renal impairment can significantly alter the disposition of tolterodine and its metabolites. The dose of DETROL LA should be reduced to 2 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr: 10-30 mL/min). Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of DETROL LA in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ]. 5.8 Myasthenia Gravis Administer DETROL LA with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.9 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ], the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe DETROL LA to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with DETROL or DETROL LA."

Patients with CCr<10 mL/min have not been studied and use of DETROL LA in this population is not recommended [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ]. 5.7 Myasthenia Gravis Administer DETROL LA with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. 5.8 Use in Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ], the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe DETROL LA to patients with a known history of QT prolongation or to patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications. There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with DETROL or DETROL LA."

        "Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of tolterodine when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Variability in Metabolism and Drug-Drug Interactions ). For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals (e.g., itraconazole, miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of DETROL is 1 mg twice daily (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for DETROL Tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with DETROL (N=2133) or placebo (N=938). The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to DETROL 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving DETROL 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving DETROL were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with DETROL and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with DETROL discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of DETROL were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with DETROL 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality. Table 5.

Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g. confusion, disorientation, delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."
