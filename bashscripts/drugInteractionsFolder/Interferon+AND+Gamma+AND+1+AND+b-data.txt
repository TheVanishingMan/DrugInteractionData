        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more details in other sections of labeling: •Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic-Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] •Depression and Suicide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] •Congestive Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] •Injection Site Necrosis and Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] •Leukopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] •Flu-Like Symptom Complex [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] •Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] In controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% more frequent on Betaseron than on placebo) were: Injection site reaction, lymphopenia, flu-like symptoms, myalgia, leukopenia, neutropenia, increased liver enzymes, headache, hypertonia, pain, rash, insomnia, abdominal pain, and asthenia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-842-2937 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and over varying lengths of time, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of Betaseron cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of other drugs, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Among 1407 patients with MS treated with Betaseron 0.25 mg every other day (including 1261 patients treated for greater than one year), the most commonly reported adverse reactions (at least 5% more frequent on Betaseron than on placebo) were injection site reaction, lymphopenia, flu-like symptoms, myalgia leukopenia, neutropenia, increased liver enzymes, headache, hypertonia, pain, rash, insomnia, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most frequently reported adverse reactions resulting in clinical intervention (for example, discontinuation of Betaseron, adjustment in dosage, or the need for concomitant medication to treat an adverse reaction symptom) were depression, flu-like symptom complex, injection site reactions, leukopenia, increased liver enzymes, asthenia, hypertonia, and myasthenia. Table 2 enumerates adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities that occurred among patients treated with 0.25 mg of Betaseron every other day by subcutaneous injection in the pooled placebo-controlled trials (Study 1-4) at an incidence that was at least 2% more than that observed in the placebo-treated patients [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 2 Adverse Reactions and Laboratory Abnormalities in Patients with MS in Pooled Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=965) Betaseron (N=1407) Blood and lymphatic system disorders Lymphocytes count decreased (<1500/mm3) 66% 86% Absolute neutrophil count decreased (< 1500/mm3) \"Injection site reaction\" comprises all adverse reactions occurring at the injection site (except injection site necrosis), that is, the following terms: injection site reaction, injection site hemorrhage, injection site hypersensitivity, injection site inflammation, injection site mass, injection site pain, injection site edema and injection site atrophy. 5% 13% White blood cell count decreased (<3000/mm3) 4% 13% Lymphadenopathy 3% 6% Nervous system disorders Headache 43% 50% Insomnia 16% 21% Incoordination 15% 17% Vascular disorders Hypertension 4% 6% Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnea 3% 6% Gastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain 11% 16% Hepatobiliary disorders Alanine aminotransferase increased (SGPT > 5 times baseline) 4% 12% Aspartate aminotransferase increased (SGOT > 5 times baseline) 1% 4% Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash 15% 21% Skin disorder 8% 10% Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Hypertonia 33% 40% Myalgia 14% 23% Renal and urinary disorders Urinary urgency 8% 11% Reproductive system and breast disorders Metrorrhagia 7% 9% Impotence 6% 8% General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site reaction 26% 78% Asthenia 48% 53% Flu-like symptoms (complex)\"Flu-like symptom (complex)\" denotes flu syndrome and/or a combination of at least two adverse reactions from fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, sweating. 37% 57% Pain 35% 42% Fever 19% 31% Chills 9% 21% Peripheral edema 10% 12% Chest pain 6% 9% Malaise 3% 6% Injection site necrosis 0% 4% In addition to the Adverse Reactions listed in Table 2, the following adverse reactions occurred more frequently on Betaseron than on placebo, but with a difference smaller than 2%: alopecia, anxiety, arthralgia, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspepsia, dysmenorrhea, leg cramps, menorrhagia, myasthenia, nausea, nervousness, palpitations, peripheral vascular disorder, prostatic disorder, tachycardia, urinary frequency, vasodilatation, and weight increase. Laboratory Abnormalities In the four clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4), leukopenia was reported in 18% and 6% of patients in Betaseron- and placebo-treated groups, respectively. No patients were withdrawn or dose reduced for neutropenia in Study 1. Three percent (3%) of patients in Studies 2 and 3 experienced leukopenia and were dose-reduced. Other abnormalities included increase of SGPT to greater than five times baseline value (12%), and increase of SGOT to greater than five times baseline value (4%). In Study 1, two patients were dose reduced for increased hepatic enzymes; one continued on treatment and one was ultimately withdrawn. In Studies 2 and 3, 1.5% of Betaseron patients were dose-reduced or interrupted treatment for increased hepatic enzymes. In Study 4, 1.7% of patients were withdrawn from treatment due to increased hepatic enzymes, two of them after a dose reduction. In Studies 1-4, nine (0.6%) patients were withdrawn from treatment with Betaseron for any laboratory abnormality, including four (0.3%) patients following dose reduction. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Serum samples were monitored for the development of antibodies to Betaseron during Study 1. In patients receiving 0.25 mg every other day 56/124 (45%) were found to have serum neutralizing activity at one or more of the time points tested. In Study 4, neutralizing activity was measured every 6 months and at end of study. At individual visits after start of therapy, activity was observed in 17% up to 25% of the Betaseron-treated patients. Such neutralizing activity was measured at least once in 75 (30%) out of 251 Betaseron patients who provided samples during treatment phase; of these, 17 (23%) converted to negative status later in the study. Based on all the available evidence, the relationship between antibody formation and clinical safety or efficacy is not known. These data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to Betaseron using a biological neutralization assay that measures the ability of immune sera to inhibit the production of the interferon-inducible protein, MxA. Neutralization assays are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of neutralizing activity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Betaseron with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with the use of Betaseron [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Betaseron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Anemia, Thrombocytopenia Endocrine disorders: Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Thyroid dysfunction Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Triglycerideincreased, Anorexia, Weight decrease, Weight increase Psychiatric disorders: Anxiety, Confusion, Emotional lability Nervous system disorders: Convulsion, Dizziness, Psychotic symptoms Cardiac disorders: Cardiomyopathy, Palpitations, Tachycardia Vascular disorders: Vasodilatation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Bronchospasm Gastrointestinal disorders: Diarrhea, Nausea, Pancreatitis, Vomiting Hepatobiliary disorders: Hepatitis, Gamma GT increased Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, Pruritus, Skin discoloration, Urticaria Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Arthralgia Reproductive system and breast disorder: Menorrhagia General disorders and administration site conditions: Fatal capillary leak syndrome1 1The administration of cytokines to patients with a pre-existing monoclonal gammopathy has been associated with the development of this syndrome."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hepatic Injury: Monitor liver function tests and signs and symptoms of hepatic injury; consider discontinuing Betaseron if serious hepatic injury occurs. (5.1, 5.9) • Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions: Discontinue if anaphylaxis occurs. (5.2) • Depression and Suicide: Advise patients to immediately report any symptom of depression and/or suicidal ideation; consider discontinuation of Betaseron if depression occurs. (5.3) • Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Monitor patients with CHF for worsening of cardiac symptoms; consider discontinuation of Betaseron if worsening of CHF occurs. (5.4) • Injection Site Necrosis and Reactions: Do not administer Betaseron into affected area until fully healed; if multiple lesions occur, discontinue Betaseron until healing of skin lesions. (5.5) • Leukopenia: Monitor complete blood count. (5.6, 5.9) • Flu-Like Symptom Complex: Consider analgesics and/or antipyretics on injection days. (5.7) 5.1 Hepatic Injury Severe hepatic injury including cases of hepatic failure, some of which have been due to autoimmune hepatitis, has been rarely reported in patients taking Betaseron. In some cases, these events have occurred in the presence of other drugs or comorbid medical conditions that have been associated with hepatic injury. Consider the potential risk of Betaseron used in combination with known hepatotoxic drugs or other products (e.g., alcohol) prior to Betaseron administration, or when adding new agents to the regimen of patients already on Betaseron. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury. Consider discontinuing Betaseron if serum transaminase levels significantly increase, or if they are associated with clinical symptoms such as jaundice. Asymptomatic elevation of serum transaminases is common in patients treated with Betaseron. In controlled clinical trials, elevations of SGPT to greater than five times baseline value were reported in 12% of patients receiving Betaseron (compared to 4% on placebo), and increases of SGOT to greater than five times baseline value were reported in 4% of patients receiving Betaseron (compared to 1% on placebo), leading to dose-reduction or discontinuation of treatment in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor liver function tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. 5.2 Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic-Reactions Anaphylaxis has been reported as a rare complication of Betaseron use. Other allergic reactions have included dyspnea, bronchospasm, tongue edema, skin rash and urticaria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Discontinue Betaseron if anaphylaxis occurs. 5.3 Depression and Suicide Depression and suicide have been reported to occur with increased frequency in patients receiving interferon beta products, including Betaseron. Advise patients to report any symptom of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their healthcare provider. If a patient develops depression, discontinuation of Betaseron therapy should be considered. In randomized controlled clinical trials, there were three suicides and eight suicide attempts among the 1532 patients on Betaseron compared to one suicide and four suicide attempts among 965 patients on placebo. 5.4 Congestive Heart Failure Monitor patients with pre-existing congestive heart failure (CHF) for worsening of their cardiac condition during initiation of and continued treatment with Betaseron. While beta interferons do not have any known direct-acting cardiac toxicity, cases of CHF, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with CHF have been reported in patients without known predisposition to these events, and without other known etiologies being established. In some cases, these events have been temporally related to the administration of Betaseron. Recurrence upon rechallenge was observed in some patients. Consider discontinuation of Betaseron if worsening of CHF occurs with no other etiology. 5.5 Injection Site Necrosis and Reactions Injection site necrosis (ISN) was reported in 4% of Betaseron-treated patients in controlled clinical trials (compared to 0% on placebo) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Typically, ISN occurs within the first four months of therapy, although postmarketing reports have been received of ISN occurring over one year after initiation of therapy. The necrotic lesions are typically three cm or less in diameter, but larger areas have been reported. Generally the necrosis has extended only to subcutaneous fat, but has extended to the fascia overlying muscle. In some lesions where biopsy results are available, vasculitis has been reported. For some lesions, debridement, and/or skin grafting have been required. In most cases healing was associated with scarring. Whether to discontinue therapy following a single site of necrosis is dependent on the extent of necrosis. For patients who continue therapy with Betaseron after injection site necrosis has occurred, avoid administration of Betaseron into the affected area until it is fully healed. If multiple lesions occur, discontinue therapy until healing occurs. Periodically evaluate patient understanding and use of aseptic self-injection techniques and procedures, particularly if injection site necrosis has occurred. In controlled clinical trials, injection site reactions occurred in 78% of patients receiving Betaseron with injection site necrosis in 4%. Injection site inflammation (42%), injection site pain (16%), injection site hypersensitivity (4%), injection site necrosis (4%), injection site mass (2%), injection site edema (2%) and nonspecific reactions were significantly associated with Betaseron treatment. The incidence of injection site reactions tended to decrease over time. Approximately 69% of patients experienced injection site reactions during the first three months of treatment, compared to approximately 40% at the end of the studies. 5.6 Leukopenia In controlled clinical trials, leukopenia was reported in 18% of patients receiving Betaseron (compared to 6% on placebo), leading to a reduction of the dose of Betaseron in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitoring of complete blood and differential white blood cell counts is recommended. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. 5.7 Flu-Like Symptom Complex In controlled clinical trials, the rate of flu-like symptom complex for patients on Betaseron was 57% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The incidence decreased over time, with 10% of patients reporting flu-like symptom complex at the end of the studies. The median duration of flu-like symptom complex in Study 1 was 7.5 days [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Analgesics and/or antipyretics on treatment days may help ameliorate flu-like symptoms associated with Betaseron use. 5.8 Seizures Seizures have been temporally associated with the use of beta interferons in clinical trials and postmarketing safety surveillance. It is not known whether these events were related to a primary seizure disorder, the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, the use of beta interferons, other potential precipitants of seizures (e.g., fever), or to some combination of these. 5.9 Monitoring for Laboratory Abnormalities In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, complete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts and blood chemistries, including liver function tests, are recommended at regular intervals (one, three, and six months) following introduction of Betaseron therapy, and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms."

(5.8) • Drug-induced Lupus Erythematosus: Cases of drug-induced lupus erythematosus have been reported. Discontinue EXTAVIA if patients develop new characteristic signs and symptoms. (5.10) 5.1 Hepatic Injury Severe hepatic injury including cases of hepatic failure, some of which have been due to autoimmune hepatitis, has been rarely reported in patients taking EXTAVIA. In some cases, these events have occurred in the presence of other drugs or comorbid medical conditions that have been associated with hepatic injury.

Monitor liver function tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.2 Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions Anaphylaxis has been reported as a rare complication of interferon beta-1b use. Other allergic reactions have included dyspnea, bronchospasm, tongue edema, skin rash, and urticaria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Discontinue EXTAVIA if anaphylaxis occurs. The removable rubber cap of the diluent (Sodium Chloride, 0.54% Solution) pre-filled syringe contains natural rubber latex, which may cause allergic reactions and should not be handled by latex-sensitive individuals. The safe use of EXTAVIA pre-filled syringe in latex-sensitive individuals has not been studied. 5.3 Depression and Suicide Depression and suicide have been reported to occur with increased frequency in patients receiving interferon beta products, including interferon beta-1b. Advise patients to report any symptom of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their healthcare provider. If a patient develops depression, discontinuation of EXTAVIA therapy should be considered. In randomized controlled clinical trials, there were three suicides and eight suicide attempts among the 1532 patients on interferon beta-1b compared to one suicide and four suicide attempts among 965 patients on placebo. 5.4 Congestive Heart Failure Monitor patients with preexisting congestive heart failure (CHF) for worsening of their cardiac condition during initiation of and continued treatment with EXTAVIA. While beta interferons do not have any known direct-acting cardiac toxicity, cases of CHF, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with CHF have been reported in patients without known predisposition to these events, and without other known etiologies being established. In some cases, these events have been temporally related to the administration of interferon beta-1b. Recurrence upon rechallenge was observed in some patients.

Injection site inflammation (42%), injection site pain (16%), injection site hypersensitivity (4%), injection site necrosis (4%), injection site mass (2%), injection site edema (2%) and nonspecific reactions were significantly associated with interferon beta-1b treatment. The incidence of injection site reactions tended to decrease over time. Approximately 69% of patients experienced injection site reactions during the first three months of treatment, compared to approximately 40% at the end of the studies. 5.6 Leukopenia In controlled clinical trials, leukopenia was reported in 18% of patients receiving interferon beta-1b (compared to 6% on placebo), leading to a reduction of the dose of interferon beta-1b in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitoring of complete blood and differential white blood cell counts is recommended. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. 5.7 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, some fatal, have been reported with interferon beta products, including EXTAVIA. Cases have been reported several weeks to years after starting interferon beta products. Discontinue EXTAVIA if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur, and manage as clinically indicated. 5.8 Flu-like Symptom Complex In controlled clinical trials, the rate of flu-like symptom complex for patients on interferon beta-1b was 57% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The incidence decreased over time, with 10% of patients reporting flu-like symptom complex at the end of the studies. The median duration of flu-like symptom complex in Study 1 was 7.5 days [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Analgesics and/or antipyretics on treatment days may help ameliorate flu-like symptoms associated with EXTAVIA use. 5.9 Seizures Seizures have been temporally associated with the use of beta interferons in clinical trials and postmarketing safety surveillance. It is not known whether these events were related to a primary seizure disorder, the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, the use of beta interferons, other potential precipitants of seizures (e.g., fever), or to some combination of these. 5.10 Drug-induced Lupus Erythematosus Cases of drug-induced lupus erythematosus have been reported with some interferon beta products, including EXTAVIA. Signs and symptoms of drug-induced lupus reported in EXTAVIA-treated patients have included rash, serositis, polyarthritis, nephritis, and Raynaud’s phenomenon. Cases have occurred with positive serologic testing (including positive anti-nuclear and/or anti-double-stranded DNA antibody testing). If EXTAVIA-treated patients develop new signs and symptoms characteristic of this syndrome, EXTAVIA therapy should be stopped. 5.11 Monitoring for Laboratory Abnormalities In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, complete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts and blood chemistries, including liver function tests, are recommended at regular intervals (one, three, and six months) following introduction of EXTAVIA therapy, and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more details in other sections of labeling: •Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] •Depression and Suicide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] •Congestive Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] •Injection Site Necrosis and Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] •Leukopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] •Thrombotic Microangiopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] •Flu-like Symptom Complex [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] •Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] •Drug Induced Lupus Erythematosus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] In controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% more frequent on BETASERON than on placebo) were: injection site reaction, lymphopenia, flu-like symptoms, myalgia, leukopenia, neutropenia, increased liver enzymes, headache, hypertonia, pain, rash, insomnia, abdominal pain, and asthenia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-842-2937 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and over varying lengths of time, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of BETASERON cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of other drugs, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Among 1407 patients with MS treated with BETASERON 0.25 mg every other day (including 1261 patients treated for greater than one year), the most commonly reported adverse reactions (at least 5% more frequent on BETASERON than on placebo) were injection site reaction, lymphopenia, flu-like symptoms, myalgia leukopenia, neutropenia, increased liver enzymes, headache, hypertonia, pain, rash, insomnia, abdominal pain, and asthenia. The most frequently reported adverse reactions resulting in clinical intervention (for example, discontinuation of BETASERON, adjustment in dosage, or the need for concomitant medication to treat an adverse reaction symptom) were depression, flu-like symptom complex, injection site reactions, leukopenia, increased liver enzymes, asthenia, hypertonia, and myasthenia. Table 2 enumerates adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities that occurred among patients treated with 0.25 mg of BETASERON every other day by subcutaneous injection in the pooled placebo-controlled trials (Study 1-4) at an incidence that was at least 2% more than that observed in the placebo-treated patients [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 2: Adverse Reactions and Laboratory Abnormalities in Patients with MS in Pooled Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=965) BETASERON (N=1407) Blood and lymphatic system disorders Lymphocytes count decreased (<1500/mm3) 66% 86% Absolute neutrophil count decreased (< 1500/mm3)\"Injection site reaction\" comprises all adverse reactions occurring at the injection site (except injection site necrosis), that is, the following terms: injection site reaction, injection site hemorrhage, injection site hypersensitivity, injection site inflammation, injection site mass, injection site pain, injection site edema and injection site atrophy. 5% 13% White blood cell count decreased (<3000/mm3) 4% 13% Lymphadenopathy 3% 6% Nervous system disorders Headache 43% 50% Insomnia 16% 21% Incoordination 15% 17% Vascular disorders Hypertension 4% 6% Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnea 3% 6% Gastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain 11% 16% Hepatobiliary disorders Alanine aminotransferase increased (SGPT > 5 times baseline) 4% 12% Aspartate aminotransferase increased (SGOT > 5 times baseline) 1% 4% Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash 15% 21% Skin disorder 8% 10% Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Hypertonia 33% 40% Myalgia 14% 23% Renal and urinary disorders Urinary urgency 8% 11% Reproductive system and breast disorders Metrorrhagia 7% 9% Impotence 6% 8% General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site reaction 26% 78% Asthenia 48% 53% Flu-like symptoms (complex)\"Flu-like symptom (complex)\" denotes flu syndrome and/or a combination of at least two adverse reactions from fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, sweating. 37% 57% Pain 35% 42% Fever 19% 31% Chills 9% 21% Peripheral edema 10% 12% Chest pain 6% 9% Malaise 3% 6% Injection site necrosis 0% 4% In addition to the Adverse Reactions listed in Table 2, the following adverse reactions occurred more frequently on BETASERON than on placebo, but with a difference smaller than 2%: alopecia, anxiety, arthralgia, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspepsia, dysmenorrhea, leg cramps, menorrhagia, myasthenia, nausea, nervousness, palpitations, peripheral vascular disorder, prostatic disorder, tachycardia, urinary frequency, vasodilatation, and weight increase. Laboratory Abnormalities In the four clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4), leukopenia was reported in 18% and 6% of patients in BETASERON- and placebo-treated groups, respectively. No patients were withdrawn or dose reduced for neutropenia in Study 1. Three percent (3%) of patients in Studies 2 and 3 experienced leukopenia and were dose-reduced. Other abnormalities included increase of SGPT to greater than five times baseline value (12%), and increase of SGOT to greater than five times baseline value (4%). In Study 1, two patients were dose reduced for increased hepatic enzymes; one continued on treatment and one was ultimately withdrawn. In Studies 2 and 3, 1.5% of BETASERON patients were dose-reduced or interrupted treatment for increased hepatic enzymes. In Study 4, 1.7% of patients were withdrawn from treatment due to increased hepatic enzymes, two of them after a dose reduction. In Studies 1-4, nine (0.6%) patients were withdrawn from treatment with BETASERON for any laboratory abnormality, including four (0.3%) patients following dose reduction. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Serum samples were monitored for the development of antibodies to BETASERON during Study 1. In patients receiving 0.25 mg every other day 56/124 (45%) were found to have serum neutralizing activity at one or more of the time points tested. In Study 4, neutralizing activity was measured every 6 months and at end of study. At individual visits after start of therapy, activity was observed in 17% up to 25% of the BETASERON-treated patients. Such neutralizing activity was measured at least once in 75 (30%) out of 251 BETASERON patients who provided samples during treatment phase; of these, 17 (23%) converted to negative status later in the study. Based on all the available evidence, the relationship between antibody formation and clinical safety or efficacy is not known. These data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to BETASERON using a biological neutralization assay that measures the ability of immune sera to inhibit the production of the interferon-inducible protein, MxA. Neutralization assays are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of neutralizing activity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to BETASERON with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with the use of BETASERON [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BETASERON. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Anemia, Thrombocytopenia Endocrine disorders: Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism, Thyroid dysfunction Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Triglyceride increased, Anorexia, Weight decrease, Weight increase Psychiatric disorders: Anxiety, Confusion, Emotional lability Nervous system disorders: Convulsion, Dizziness, Psychotic symptoms Cardiac disorders: Cardiomyopathy, Palpitations, Tachycardia Vascular disorders: Vasodilatation Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Bronchospasm Gastrointestinal disorders: Diarrhea, Nausea, Pancreatitis, Vomiting Hepatobiliary disorders: Hepatitis, Gamma GT increased Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, Pruritus, Skin discoloration, Urticaria Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Arthralgia Reproductive system and breast disorder: Menorrhagia General disorders and administration site conditions: Fatal capillary leak syndrome1 1The administration of cytokines to patients with a pre-existing monoclonal gammopathy has been associated with the development of this syndrome."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hepatic Injury: Monitor liver function tests and signs and symptoms of hepatic injury; consider discontinuing BETASERON if serious hepatic injury occurs. (5.1, 5.11) • Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions: Discontinue if anaphylaxis occurs. (5.2) • Depression and Suicide: Advise patients to immediately report any symptom of depression and/or suicidal ideation; consider discontinuation of BETASERON if depression occurs. (5.3) • Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Monitor patients with CHF for worsening of cardiac symptoms; consider discontinuation of BETASERON if worsening of CHF occurs. (5.4) • Injection Site Necrosis and Reactions: Do not administer BETASERON into affected area until fully healed; if multiple lesions occur, discontinue BETASERON until healing of skin lesions. (5.5) • Leukopenia: Monitor complete blood count. (5.6, 5.11) • Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy have been reported. Discontinue BETASERON if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur. (5.7) • Flu-like Symptom Complex: Consider analgesics and/or antipyretics on injection days. (5.8) • Drug-induced Lupus Erythematosus: Cases of drug-induced lupus erythematosus have been reported. Discontinue BETASERON if patients develop new characteristic signs and symptoms. (5.10) 5.1 Hepatic Injury Severe hepatic injury including cases of hepatic failure, some of which have been due to autoimmune hepatitis, has been rarely reported in patients taking BETASERON. In some cases, these events have occurred in the presence of other drugs or comorbid medical conditions that have been associated with hepatic injury. Consider the potential risk of BETASERON used in combination with known hepatotoxic drugs or other products (eg, alcohol) prior to BETASERON administration, or when adding new agents to the regimen of patients already on BETASERON. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury. Consider discontinuing BETASERON if serum transaminase levels significantly increase, or if they are associated with clinical symptoms such as jaundice. Asymptomatic elevation of serum transaminases is common in patients treated with BETASERON. In controlled clinical trials, elevations of SGPT to greater than five times baseline value were reported in 12% of patients receiving BETASERON (compared to 4% on placebo), and increases of SGOT to greater than five times baseline value were reported in 4% of patients receiving BETASERON (compared to 1% on placebo), leading to dose-reduction or discontinuation of treatment in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor liver function tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. 5.2 Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions Anaphylaxis has been reported as a rare complication of BETASERON use. Other allergic reactions have included dyspnea, bronchospasm, tongue edema, skin rash and urticaria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Discontinue BETASERON if anaphylaxis occurs. 5.3 Depression and Suicide Depression and suicide have been reported to occur with increased frequency in patients receiving interferon beta products, including BETASERON. Advise patients to report any symptom of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their healthcare provider. If a patient develops depression, discontinuation of BETASERON therapy should be considered. In randomized controlled clinical trials, there were three suicides and eight suicide attempts among the 1532 patients on BETASERON compared to one suicide and four suicide attempts among 965 patients on placebo. 5.4 Congestive Heart Failure Monitor patients with pre-existing congestive heart failure (CHF) for worsening of their cardiac condition during initiation of and continued treatment with BETASERON. While beta interferons do not have any known direct-acting cardiac toxicity, cases of CHF, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with CHF have been reported in patients without known predisposition to these events, and without other known etiologies being established. In some cases, these events have been temporally related to the administration of BETASERON. Recurrence upon rechallenge was observed in some patients. Consider discontinuation of BETASERON if worsening of CHF occurs with no other etiology. 5.5 Injection Site Necrosis and Reactions Injection site necrosis (ISN) was reported in 4% of BETASERON-treated patients in controlled clinical trials (compared to 0% on placebo) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Typically, ISN occurs within the first four months of therapy, although postmarketing reports have been received of ISN occurring over one year after initiation of therapy. The necrotic lesions are typically 3 cm or less in diameter, but larger areas have been reported. Generally the necrosis has extended only to subcutaneous fat, but has extended to the fascia overlying muscle. In some lesions where biopsy results are available, vasculitis has been reported. For some lesions, debridement, and/or skin grafting have been required. In most cases healing was associated with scarring. Whether to discontinue therapy following a single site of necrosis is dependent on the extent of necrosis. For patients who continue therapy with BETASERON after injection site necrosis has occurred, avoid administration of BETASERON into the affected area until it is fully healed. If multiple lesions occur, discontinue therapy until healing occurs. Periodically evaluate patient understanding and use of aseptic self-injection techniques and procedures, particularly if injection site necrosis has occurred. In controlled clinical trials, injection site reactions occurred in 78% of patients receiving BETASERON with injection site necrosis in 4%. Injection site inflammation (42%), injection site pain (16%), injection site hypersensitivity (4%), injection site necrosis (4%), injection site mass (2%), injection site edema (2%) and nonspecific reactions were significantly associated with BETASERON treatment. The incidence of injection site reactions tended to decrease over time. Approximately 69% of patients experienced injection site reactions during the first three months of treatment, compared to approximately 40% at the end of the studies. 5.6 Leukopenia In controlled clinical trials, leukopenia was reported in 18% of patients receiving BETASERON (compared to 6% on placebo), leading to a reduction of the dose of BETASERON in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitoring of complete blood and differential white blood cell counts is recommended. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. 5.7 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, some fatal, have been reported with interferon beta products, including BETASERON. Cases have been reported several weeks to years after starting interferon beta products. Discontinue BETASERON if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur, and manage as clinically indicated. 5.8 Flu-like Symptom Complex In controlled clinical trials, the rate of flu-like symptom complex for patients on BETASERON was 57% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The incidence decreased over time, with 10% of patients reporting flu-like symptom complex at the end of the studies. The median duration of flu-like symptom complex in Study 1 was 7.5 days [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Analgesics and/or antipyretics on treatment days may help ameliorate flu-like symptoms associated with BETASERON use. 5.9 Seizures Seizures have been temporally associated with the use of beta interferons in clinical trials and postmarketing safety surveillance. It is not known whether these events were related to a primary seizure disorder, the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, the use of beta interferons, other potential precipitants of seizures (eg, fever), or to some combination of these. 5.10 Drug-induced Lupus Erythematosus Cases of drug-induced lupus erythematosus have been reported with some interferon beta products, including BETASERON. Signs and symptoms of drug-induced lupus reported in BETASERON-treated patients have included rash, serositis, polyarthritis, nephritis, and Raynaud’s phenomenon. Cases have occurred with positive serologic testing (including positive anti-nuclear and/or anti-double-stranded DNA antibody testing). If BETASERON-treated patients develop new signs and symptoms characteristic of this syndrome, BETASERON therapy should be stopped. 5.11 Monitoring for Laboratory Abnormalities In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, complete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts and blood chemistries, including liver function tests, are recommended at regular intervals (one, three, and six months) following introduction of BETASERON therapy, and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biogen Idec at 1-800-456-2255 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of AVONEX cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Among 351 patients with relapsing forms of MS treated with AVONEX 30 micrograms (including 319 patients treated for 6 months and 288 patients treated for greater than one year) the most commonly reported adverse reactions (at least 5% more frequent on AVONEX than on placebo) were flu-like symptoms. Symptoms can include chills, fever, myalgia and asthenia occurring within hours to days following an injection. Most people who take AVONEX have flu-like symptoms early during the course of therapy. Usually, these symptoms last for a day after the injection. For many people, these symptoms lessen or go away over time. The most frequently reported adverse reactions resulting in clinical intervention (for example, discontinuation of AVONEX or the need for concomitant medication to treat an adverse reaction symptom) were flu-like symptoms and depression. Table 2 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred with AVONEX-treated patients at an incidence of at least 2% more than that observed in the placebo-treated patients in the pooled placebo-controlled studies in patients with relapsing forms of MS [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 2: Adverse Reactions in the Placebo-Controlled Studies Placebo AVONEX Adverse Reaction (N = 333) (N = 351) Body as a Whole Headache 55% 58% Flu-like symptoms (otherwise unspecified) 29% 49% Pain 21% 23% Asthenia 18% 24% Fever 9% 20% Chills 5% 19% Abdominal pain 6% 8% Injection site pain 6% 8% Infection 4% 7% Injection site inflammation 2% 6% Chest pain 2% 5% Injection site reaction 1% 3% Toothache 1% 3% Nervous System Depression 14% 18% Dizziness 12% 14% Respiratory System Upper respiratory tract infection 12% 14% Sinusitis 12% 14% Bronchitis 5% 8% Digestive System Nausea 19% 23% Musculoskeletal System Myalgia 22% 29% Arthralgia 6% 9% Urogenital Urinary tract infection 15% 17% Urine constituents abnormal 0% 3% Skin and Appendages Alopecia 2% 4% Special Senses Eye disorder 2% 4% Hemic and Lymphatic System Injection site ecchymosis 4% 6% Anemia 1% 4% Cardiovascular System Migraine 3% 5% Vasodilation 0% 2% Immunogenicity Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions have occurred in AVONEX-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. In studies assessing immunogenicity in multiple sclerosis patients administered AVONEX for at least 1 year, 5% (21 of 390 patients) showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies at one or more times. These data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to AVONEX using a two-tiered assay (ELISA binding assay followed by an antiviral cytopathic effect assay), and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of neutralizing activity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to AVONEX with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVONEX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Menorrhagia and metrorrhagia Rash (including vesicular rash) Rare cases of injection site abscess or cellulitis requiring surgical intervention"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Depression, Suicide, and Psychotic Disorders: advise patients to immediately report any symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation, and/or psychosis; consider discontinuation of AVONEX if depression occurs (5.1) Hepatic Injury: monitor liver function tests; monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury; consider discontinuation of AVONEX if hepatic injury occurs (5.2, 5.9) Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic-Reactions: Discontinue if occurs (5.3) Congestive Heart Failure: monitor patients with pre-existing significant cardiac disease for worsening of cardiac symptoms (5.4) Decreased Peripheral Blood Counts: monitor complete blood count (5.5, 5.9) Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy have been reported. Discontinue AVONEX if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur (5.6) Autoimmune Disorders: consider discontinuation of AVONEX if new autoimmune disorder occurs (5.8, 5.9) 5.1 Depression, Suicide, and Psychotic Disorders Patients treated with AVONEX and their caregivers should be advised to report immediately any symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation, and/or psychosis to their prescribing physicians. If a patient develops depression or other severe psychiatric symptoms, cessation of AVONEX therapy should be considered. Depression and suicide have been reported to occur with increased frequency in patients receiving AVONEX. In Study 1, the incidence of depression was similar in placebo-treated and in AVONEX-treated patients, but suicidal tendency was seen more frequently in AVONEX-treated patients (4% in AVONEX group vs. 1% in placebo group). In Study 2, there was a greater incidence of depression in AVONEX-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (20% in AVONEX group vs. 13% in placebo group) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Additionally, there have been postmarketing reports of depression, suicidal ideation, and/or development of new or worsening of other pre-existing psychiatric disorders, including psychosis. For some of these patients, symptoms of depression improved upon cessation of AVONEX. 5.2 Hepatic Injury Severe hepatic injury, including cases of hepatic failure, has been reported rarely in patients taking AVONEX. Asymptomatic elevation of hepatic transaminases has also been reported, and in some patients has recurred upon rechallenge with AVONEX. In some cases, these events have occurred in the presence of other drugs that have been associated with hepatic injury. The potential risk of AVONEX used in combination with known hepatotoxic drugs or other products (e.g., alcohol) should be considered prior to starting AVONEX, or before starting hepatotoxic drugs. Patients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 5.3 Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic-Reactions Anaphylaxis has been reported as a rare complication of AVONEX use. Other allergic reactions have included dyspnea, orolingual edema, skin rash and urticaria. Discontinue AVONEX if anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions occur. 5.4 Congestive Heart Failure Patients with pre-existing congestive heart failure should be monitored for worsening of their cardiac condition during initiation of and continued treatment with AVONEX. While beta interferons do not have any known direct cardiac toxicity, during the postmarketing period cases of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure have been reported in patients without known predisposition to these events, and without other etiologies being established. In some cases, these events have been temporally related to the administration of AVONEX. In some of these instances recurrence upon rechallenge was observed. 5.5 Decreased Peripheral Blood Counts Decreased peripheral blood counts in all cell lines, including rare pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia, have been reported from postmarketing experience in AVONEX-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In some cases, platelet counts were below 10,000/microliter. Some cases recurred with rechallenge [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients should be monitored for symptoms or signs of decreased blood counts. 5.6 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, some fatal, have been reported with interferon beta products, including AVONEX. Cases have been reported several weeks to years after starting interferon beta products. Discontinue AVONEX if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur, and manage as clinically indicated. 5.7 Seizures Seizures have been temporally associated with the use of beta interferons in clinical trials and postmarketing safety surveillance. In the two placebo-controlled studies in multiple sclerosis (Studies 1 and 2), 4 patients receiving AVONEX experienced seizures, while no seizures occurred in the placebo group [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Three of these 4 patients had no prior history of seizure [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It is not known whether these events were related to the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, to AVONEX, or to a combination of both. 5.8 Autoimmune Disorders Postmarketing reports of autoimmune disorders of multiple target organs in AVONEX-treated patients included idiopathic thrombocytopenia, hyper- and hypothyroidism, and rare cases of autoimmune hepatitis. If AVONEX-treated patients develop a new autoimmune disorder, consider stopping the therapy. 5.9 Laboratory Tests In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, complete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistries, including liver function tests, are recommended during AVONEX therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5, 5.7)]. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. Thyroid function should be monitored periodically. If patients have or develop symptoms of thyroid dysfunction (hypo- or hyperthyroidism), thyroid function tests should be performed according to standard medical practice."
