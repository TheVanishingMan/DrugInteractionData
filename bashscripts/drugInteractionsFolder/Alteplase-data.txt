        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In the clinical trials, the most serious adverse events reported after treatment were sepsis (see PRECAUTIONS, Infections), gastrointestinal bleeding, and venous thrombosis. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Trials 1 and 2 The data described for Trials 1 and 2 reflect exposure to Cathflo Activase in 1122 patients, of whom 880 received a single dose and 242 received two sequential doses of Cathflo Activase. In the Cathflo Activase Trials 1 and 2, only limited, focused types of serious adverse events were recorded, including death, major hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary or arterial emboli, and other serious adverse events not thought to be attributed to underlying disease or concurrent illness. Major hemorrhage was defined as severe blood loss ( > 5 mL/kg), blood loss requiring transfusion, or blood loss causing hypotension. Non‑serious adverse events and serious events thought to be due to underlying disease or concurrent illness were not recorded. Patients were observed for serious adverse events until catheter function was deemed to be restored or for a maximum of 4 or 6 hours depending on study. For most patients the observation period was 30 minutes to 2 hours. Spontaneously reported deaths and serious adverse events that were not thought to be related to the patient's underlying disease were also recorded during the 30 days following treatment. Four catheter-related sepsis events occurred from 15 minutes to 1 day after treatment with Alteplase, and a fifth sepsis event occurred on Day 3 after Alteplase treatment. All 5 patients had positive catheter or peripheral blood cultures within 24 hours after symptom onset. Three patients had a major hemorrhage from a gastrointestinal source from 2 to 3 days after Alteplase treatment. One case of injection site hemorrhage was observed at 4 hours after treatment in a patient with pre-existing thrombocytopenia. These events may have been related to underlying disease and treatments for malignancy, but a contribution to occurrence of the events from Alteplase cannot be ruled out. There were no reports of intracranial hemorrhage. Three cases of subclavian and upper extremity deep venous thrombosis were reported 3 to 7 days after treatment. These events may have been related to underlying disease or to the long-term presence of an indwelling catheter, but a contribution to occurrence of the events from Alteplase treatment cannot be ruled out. There were no reports of pulmonary emboli. There were no gender-related differences observed in the rates of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions profiles were similar across all age subgroups. Trial 3 In Trial 3 all serious adverse events were recorded with a specific interest in intracranial hemorrhage, major hemorrhage, thrombosis, embolic events, sepsis and catheter related complications. Major hemorrhage was defined as severe blood loss ( > 5 mL/kg), blood loss requiring transfusion, or blood loss causing hypotension. Non-serious adverse events were not recorded. Patients were observed until catheter function was deemed to be restored or for a maximum of 4 hours after the first dose. Additionally, serious adverse events were elicited from patients at 48 hours (up to 96 hours) following completion of treatment. No pediatric patients in Trial 3 experienced an intracranial hemorrhage, major hemorrhage, thrombosis, or an embolic event. Three cases of sepsis occurred 2 to 44 hours after treatment with Cathflo Activase. All of these patients had evidence of infection prior to administration of Cathflo Activase. An additional patient developed fever and lethargy within one day of Cathflo Activase administration, which required outpatient intravenous antibiotics. In one subject, the lumen of the catheter, placed 2 years previously, ruptured with infusion of the study drug. There were no gender-related differences observed in the rates of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions profiles were similar across all age groups. Allergic Reactions No allergic-type reactions were observed in the trials in patients treated with Alteplase. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be administered."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The interaction of Activase with other cardioactive or cerebroactive drugs has not been studied. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after Activase therapy. In the post-marketing setting, there have been reports of orolingual angioedema in patients (primarily patients with AIS) receiving concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Anticoagulants and drugs that inhibit platelet function increase the risk of bleeding when administered with Activase therapy. (7) Concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may increase the risk of orolingual angioedema. (7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in the other sections of the label: Bleeding [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Orolingual Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Cholesterol Embolization [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Reembolization of Deep Venous Thrombi during Treatment for Acute Massive Pulmonary Embolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The most frequently occurring adverse reaction ( > 5%) is bleeding. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most frequent adverse reaction associated with Activase in all approved indications is bleeding. Bleeding Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) In clinical studies in patients with AIS (Studies 1 and 2) the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, especially symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, was higher in Activase-treated patients than in placebo patients. A dose-finding study of Activase suggested that doses greater than 0.9 mg/kg may be associated with an increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage. The incidence of all-cause 90-day mortality, intracranial hemorrhage, and new ischemic stroke following Activase treatment compared to placebo are presented in Table 3 as a combined safety analysis (n=624) for Studies 1 and 2. These data indicate a significant increase in intracranial hemorrhage following Activase treatment, particularly symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours. There was no increase in the incidences of 90-day mortality or severe disability in Activase-treated patients compared to placebo. Table 3 Combined Safety Outcomes for Studies 1 and 2 Placebo (n= 312) Activase (n=312) p-ValueFisher's Exact Test. All-Cause 90-day Mortality 64 (20.5%) 54 (17.3%) 0.36 Total ICHWithin trial follow-up period. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as the occurrence of sudden clinical worsening followed by subsequent verification of intracranial hemorrhage on CT scan. Asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as intracranial hemorrhage detected on a routine repeat CT scan without preceding clinical worsening. 20 (6.4%) 48 (15.4%) <0.01 Symptomatic 4 (1.3%) 25 (8.0%) <0.01 Asymptomatic 16 (5.1%) 23 (7.4%) 0.32 Symptomatic Intracranial Hemorrhage within 36 hours 2 (0.6%) 20 (6.4%) <0.01 New Ischemic Stroke (3-months) 17 (5.4%) 18 (5.8%) 1.00 Bleeding events other than intracranial hemorrhage were noted in the studies of AIS and were consistent with the general safety profile of Activase. In Studies 1 and 2, the frequency of bleeding requiring red blood cell transfusions was 6.4% for Activase-treated patients compared to 3.8% for placebo (p = 0.19). Although exploratory analyses of Studies 1 and 2 suggest that severe neurological deficit (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS > 22]) at presentation was associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, efficacy results suggest a reduced but still favorable clinical outcome for these patients. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) For the 3-hour infusion regimen in the treatment of AMI, the incidence of significant internal bleeding (estimated as > 250 mL blood loss) has been reported in studies in over 800 patients (Table 4). These data do not include patients treated with the Activase accelerated infusion. Table 4 Incidence of Bleeding in 3-Hour Infusion in AMI Patients Total Dose ≤100 mg Gastrointestinal 5% Genitourinary 4% Ecchymosis 1% Retroperitoneal <1% Epistaxis <1% Gingival <1% The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in AMI patients treated with Activase is presented in Table 5. Table 5 Incidence of Intracranial Hemorrhage in AMI Patients Dose Number of Patients Intracranial Hemorrhage (%) 100 mg, 3-hour 3272 0.4 ≤ 100 mg, accelerated 10,396 0.7 150 mg 1779 1.3 1-1.4 mg/kg 237 0.4 A dose of 150 mg or greater should not be used in the treatment of AMI because it has been associated with an increase in intracranial bleeding. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) For acute massive pulmonary embolism, bleeding events were consistent with the general safety profile observed with Activase treatment of AMI patients receiving the 3-hour infusion regimen. Allergic Reactions Allergic-type reactions, e.g., anaphylactoid reaction, laryngeal edema, orolingual angioedema, rash, and urticaria have been reported. When such reactions occur, they usually respond to conventional therapy. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Activase. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions are frequent sequelae of the underlying disease, and the effect of Activase on the incidence of these events is unknown. Acute Ischemic Stroke: Cerebral edema, cerebral herniation, seizure, new ischemic stroke. These events may be life threatening and may lead to death. Acute Myocardial Infarction: Arrhythmias, AV block, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, cardiac arrest, recurrent ischemia, myocardial reinfarction, myocardial rupture, electromechanical dissociation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, mitral regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, thromboembolism, pulmonary edema. These events may be life threatening and may lead to death. Nausea and/or vomiting, hypotension and fever have also been reported. Pulmonary Embolism: Pulmonary reembolization, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, thromboembolism, hypotension. These events may be life threatening and may lead to death. Fever has also been reported."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increases the risk of bleeding. Avoid intramuscular injections. Monitor for bleeding. If serious bleeding occurs, discontinue Activase. (5.1) Monitor patients during and for several hours after infusion for orolingual angioedema. If angioedema develops, discontinue Activase. (5.2) Cholesterol embolism has been reported rarely in patients treated with thrombolytic agents. (5.3) Consider the risk of reembolization from the lysis of underlying deep venous thrombi in patients with pulmonary embolism. (5.4) 5.1 Bleeding Activase can cause internal bleeding (intracranial, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, respiratory) or external bleeding, especially at arterial and venous puncture sites. Avoid intramuscular injections and trauma to the patient while on Activase. Perform venipunctures carefully and only as required. To minimize bleeding from noncompressible sites, avoid internal jugular and subclavian venous punctures. If an arterial puncture is necessary during Activase infusion, use an upper extremity vessel that is accessible to manual compression, apply pressure for at least 30 minutes, and monitor the puncture site closely. Because of the higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients treated for acute ischemic stroke, limit treatment to facilities that can provide timely access to appropriate evaluation and management of intracranial hemorrhage. Fatal cases of hemorrhage associated with traumatic intubation in patients administered Activase have been reported. Aspirin and heparin have been administered concomitantly with and following infusions of Activase in the management of acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism, but the concomitant administration of heparin and aspirin with and following infusions of Activase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke during the first 24 hours after symptom onset has not been investigated. Because heparin, aspirin, or Activase may cause bleeding complications, carefully monitor for bleeding, especially at arterial puncture sites. Hemorrhage can occur 1 or more days after administration of Activase, while patients are still receiving anticoagulant therapy. If serious bleeding occurs, terminate the Activase infusion. In the following conditions, the risks of bleeding with Activase therapy for all approved indications are increased and should be weighed against the anticipated benefits: Recent major surgery or procedure, (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft, obstetrical delivery, organ biopsy, previous puncture of noncompressible vessels) Cerebrovascular disease Recent intracranial hemorrhage Recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding Recent trauma Hypertension: systolic BP above 175 mm Hg or diastolic BP above 110 mm Hg High likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g., mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation Acute pericarditis Subacute bacterial endocarditis Hemostatic defects including those secondary to severe hepatic or renal disease Significant hepatic dysfunction Pregnancy Diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy, or other hemorrhagic ophthalmic conditions Septic thrombophlebitis or occluded AV cannula at seriously infected site Advanced age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] Patients currently receiving anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin sodium) Any other condition in which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard or would be particularly difficult to manage because of its location. 5.2 Orolingual Angioedema Orolingual angioedema has been observed during and up to 2 hours after Activase infusion in patients treated for acute ischemic stroke and acute myocardial infarction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In many cases, patients received concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor patients treated with Activase during and for several hours after infusion for orolingual angioedema. If angioedema develops, discontinue the Activase infusion and promptly institute appropriate therapy (e.g., antihistamines, intravenous corticosteroids, epinephrine). 5.3 Cholesterol Embolization Cholesterol embolism has been reported rarely in patients treated with thrombolytic agents; the true incidence is unknown. Cholesterol embolism may present with livedo reticularis, \"purple toe\" syndrome, acute renal failure, gangrenous digits, hypertension, pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, retinal artery occlusion, bowel infarction, or rhabdomyolysis and can be fatal. It is associated with invasive vascular procedures (e.g., cardiac catheterization, angiography, vascular surgery) and/or anticoagulant therapy. 5.4 Reembolization of Deep Venous Thrombi during Treatment for Acute Massive Pulmonary Embolism Activase has not been shown to treat adequately underlying deep vein thrombosis in patients with PE. Consider the possible risk of reembolization due to the lysis of underlying deep venous thrombi in this setting. 5.5 Coagulation Tests May Be Unreliable during Activase Therapy Coagulation tests and measures of fibrinolytic activity may be unreliable during Activase therapy, unless specific precautions are taken to prevent in vitro artifacts. When present in blood at pharmacologic concentrations, Activase remains active under in vitro conditions, which can result in degradation of fibrinogen in blood samples removed for analysis."
