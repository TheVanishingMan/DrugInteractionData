        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Reduce CLOZARIL dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). ( , ) Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: 2.6 7.1 Concomitant use of is not recommended. ( , ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers 2.6 7.1 Consider reducing CLOZARIL dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. ( , ) Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: 2.6 7.1 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CLOZARIL Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering CLOZARIL concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of CLOZARIL and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the CLOZARIL dose to one-third of the original dose when CLOZARIL is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The CLOZARIL dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued . [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when CLOZARIL is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the CLOZARIL dosage if necessary . [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with CLOZARIL and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the CLOZARIL dose . [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of CLOZARIL. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the CLOZARIL dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of CLOZARIL and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended . [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] Consider reducing the CLOZARIL dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions . [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) . [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] 7.2 Potential for CLOZARIL to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of CLOZARIL with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYPD26 substrates. Use caution when coadministering CLOZARIL with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. ( ) Eosinophilia: 5.7 Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs). ( ) QT Interval Prolongation: 5.8 Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/ cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: Metabolic Changes: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. ( ) Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: 5.9 Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. ( ) Dyslipidemia: 5.9 Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. ( ) Weight Gain: 5.9 Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. ( ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): 5.10 Evaluate for infection, agranulocytosis, NMS. ( ) Fever: 5.11 Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep vein thrombosis occur. ( ) Pulmonary Embolism (PE): 5.12 Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs). ( ) Anticholinergic Toxicity: 5.13 Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. ( ) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: 5.14 5.1 Agranulocytosis Background Agranulocytosis, defined as an ANC of less than 500/mm , has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at 1 year of approximately 1.3%, based on the occurrence of 15 US cases out of 1743 patients exposed to CLOZARIL during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing. All of these cases occurred at a time when the need for close monitoring of WBC counts was already recognized. A hematologic risk analysis was conducted based upon the available information in the CLOZARIL National Registry for US patients. Based upon a cut-off date of April 30, 1995, the incidence rates of agranulocytosis based upon a weekly monitoring schedule rose steeply during the first 2 months of therapy, peaking in the third month. Among clozapine patients who continued the drug beyond the third month, the weekly incidence of agranulocytosis fell a substantial degree. After 6 months, the weekly incidence of agranulocytosis declines still further; however, it never reaches zero. It should be noted that any type of reduction in the frequency of monitoring WBC counts may result in an increased incidence of agranulocytosis. 3 Risk Factors Experience from clinical development, as well as from examples in the medical literature, suggests that patients who have developed agranulocytosis during clozapine therapy are at increased risk of subsequent episodes of agranulocytosis. Analysis of WBC count data from the CLOZARIL National Registry also suggests that patients who have an initial episode of moderate leukopenia (3000/mm >WBC count ≥2000/mm ) are at an increased risk of subsequent episodes of agranulocytosis. Except for bone-marrow suppression during initial clozapine therapy, there are no other established risk factors based on worldwide experience for the development of agranulocytosis in association with clozapine use. However, a disproportionate number of the US cases of agranulocytosis occurred in patients of Jewish background compared to the overall proportion of such patients exposed during domestic development of clozapine. Most of the US cases of agranulocytosis occurred within 4–10 weeks of exposure, but neither dose nor duration is a reliable predictor of this problem. Agranulocytosis associated with other antipsychotic drugs has been reported to occur with a greater frequency in women, the elderly, and in patients who are cachectic or have serious underlying medical illness; such patients may also be at particular risk with clozapine, although this has not been definitively demonstrated. 3 3 WBC Count and ANC Clinical Monitoring Schedule CLOZARIL is available only through a distribution system that ensures monitoring of WBC count and ANC according to the schedule described below prior to delivery of the next supply of medication. As described in Table 2, patients who are being treated with CLOZARIL must have a baseline WBC count and ANC before initiation of treatment, and a WBC count and ANC every week for the first 6 months. Thereafter, if acceptable WBC counts and ANCs (WBC count ≥3500/mm and ANC ≥2000/mm ) have been maintained during the first 6 months of continuous therapy, WBC counts and ANCs can be monitored every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. Thereafter, if acceptable WBC counts and ANCs (WBC count ≥3500/mm and ANC ≥2000/mm ) have been maintained during the second 6 months of continuous therapy, WBC count and ANC can be monitored every 4 weeks. 3 3 3 3 When treatment with CLOZARIL is discontinued (regardless of the reason), WBC count and ANC must be monitored weekly for at least 4 weeks from the day of discontinuation or until WBC count ≥3500/mm and ANC ≥2000/mm . 3 3 Table 2 provides a summary of the frequency of monitoring that should occur based on various stages of therapy (e.g., initiation of therapy) or results from WBC count and ANC monitoring tests (e.g., moderate leukopenia). The text that follows should be consulted for additional details regarding the treatment of patients under the various conditions (e.g., severe leukopenia). Advise patients to immediately report the appearance of signs/symptoms consistent with agranulocytosis or infection (e.g., fever, weakness, lethargy, or sore throat) at any time during CLOZARIL therapy. Such patients should have a WBC count and an ANC performed promptly. Table 2.

Additionally, patients should be carefully monitored for flu-like symptoms or other symptoms suggestive of infection. Nonrechallengeable Patients If the total WBC count falls below 2000/mm or the ANC falls below 1000/mm , bone-marrow aspiration should be considered to ascertain granulopoietic status and patients should not be rechallenged with clozapine. Protective isolation with close observation may be indicated if granulopoiesis is determined to be deficient. Should evidence of infection develop, the patient should have appropriate cultures performed and an appropriate antibiotic regimen instituted. 3 3 Patients discontinued from clozapine therapy due to significant granulopoietic suppression have been found to develop agranulocytosis upon rechallenge, often with a shorter latency on re-exposure. To reduce the chances of rechallenge occurring in patients who have experienced significant bone-marrow suppression during clozapine therapy, a single, national master file (i.e., Nonrechallengeable Database) is confidentially maintained. Treatment of Rechallengeable Patients Patients may be rechallenged with clozapine if their WBC count does not fall below 2000/mm and the ANC does not fall below 1000/mm . However, analysis of the data from the CLOZARIL National Registry suggests that patients who have an initial episode of moderate leukopenia (3000/mm >WBC count ≥2000/mm ) have up to a 12-fold increased risk of having a subsequent episode of agranulocytosis when rechallenged as compared to the full cohort of patients treated with clozapine. Although CLOZARIL therapy may be resumed if no symptoms of infection develop and when the WBC count rises above 3500/mm and the ANC rises above 2000/mm , prescribers are strongly advised to consider whether the benefit of continuing CLOZARIL treatment outweighs the increased risk of agranulocytosis. 3 3 3 3 3 3 Analyses of the CLOZARIL National Registry have shown an increased risk of having a subsequent episode of granulopoietic suppression up to a year after recovery from the initial episode. Therefore, as noted in Table 2, patients must undergo weekly WBC count and ANC monitoring for 1 year following recovery from an episode of moderate leukopenia and/or moderate granulocytopenia regardless of when the episode develops. If acceptable WBC counts and ANC (WBC count ≥3500/mm and ANC ≥2000/mm ) have been maintained during the year of weekly monitoring, WBC counts can be monitored every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If acceptable WBC counts and ANC (WBC count ≥3500/mm and ANC ≥2000/mm ) continue to be maintained during the 6 months of every 2-week monitoring, WBC counts can be monitored every 4 weeks thereafter, ad infinitum. 3 3 3 3 Interruptions in Therapy Figure 1 provides instructions regarding re-initiating therapy and subsequently the frequency of WBC count and ANC monitoring after a period of interruption. Figure 1. Resuming Monitoring Frequency after Interruption of Therapy Figure 1: Resuming Monitoring Frequency after Interruption in Therapy 5.2 CLOZARIL National Registry Because of the Risk of Agranulocytosis Because of the risk of agranulocytosis, CLOZARIL is available only through a restricted program called the CLOZARIL National Registry. Under the CLOZARIL National Registry, prescribers, patients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. Required components of the CLOZARIL National Registry are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe CLOZARIL must enroll in the program and comply with the Registry requirements. Pharmacies that dispense CLOZARIL must enroll in the program and comply with the Registry requirements. Routine monitoring and submission of laboratory results (WBC and ANC) is required during treatment with CLOZARIL . [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Patients who receive CLOZARIL must be enrolled in a registry. Further information is available at or 1-888-669-6682. http://www.clozarilregistry.com 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions . Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off CLOZARIL (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily . [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] Use CLOZARIL cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at 1 year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of 1 or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering CLOZARIL to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with CLOZARIL use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of CLOZARIL. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue CLOZARIL and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with CLOZARIL. However, if the benefit of CLOZARIL treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with CLOZARIL in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving CLOZARIL who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with CLOZARIL. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. CLOZARIL is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis . [see Boxed Warning] 5.7 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/mm , has occurred with CLOZARIL treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during CLOZARIL treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If CLOZARIL-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue CLOZARIL immediately. 3 If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to CLOZARIL is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue CLOZARIL. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue CLOZARIL under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt CLOZARIL therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with CLOZARIL treatment. When prescribing CLOZARIL, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with CLOZARIL, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue CLOZARIL if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue CLOZARIL. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of CLOZARIL. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of CLOZARIL . [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with CLOZARIL. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including CLOZARIL have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including CLOZARIL. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on CLOZARIL should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the CLOZARIL and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the CLOZARIL group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 3). The CLOZARIL doses were 100–900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for CLOZARIL and chlorpromazine. Table 3.

Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using CLOZARIL, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, CLOZARIL treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the CLOZARIL group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, CLOZARIL treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the CLOZARIL group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). In addition, CLOZARIL treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 5.The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of CLOZARIL and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The CLOZARIL dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 4.

Monitor weight during treatment with CLOZARIL. Table 6 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with CLOZARIL and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the CLOZARIL, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 6.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., agranulocytosis, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with CLOZARIL monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out agranulocytosis or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS . [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with CLOZARIL. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity CLOZARIL has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with CLOZARIL can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with CLOZARIL can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance CLOZARIL can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that CLOZARIL does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including CLOZARIL. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe CLOZARIL in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with CLOZARIL despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for CLOZARIL or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. CLOZARIL should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of CLOZARIL If abrupt discontinuation of CLOZARIL is necessary (because of agranulocytosis or another medical condition, for example), monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) (2.6, 7.1). •Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended (2.6, 7.1). • Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued (2.6, 7.1). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine tablets dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine tablets are coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 7.2 Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYPD26 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 5%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 5%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6 week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur (5.7). • QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) (5.8). • Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: • Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes (5.9). • Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (5.9). • Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain (5.9). • Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions (5.10). • Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS (5.11). • Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur (5.12). • Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) (5.13). • Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles (5.14). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/μL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥)1500/μL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient’s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level Clozapine Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (≥1500/μL) •Initiate treatment •If treatment interrupted: −< 30 days, continue monitoring as before −≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/μL) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/μL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/μL •Once ANC ≥1500/μL, return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring intervalIf clinically appropriate Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/μL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine induced neutropenia •Resume treatment once ANC ≥1000/μL •Daily until ANC ≥1000/μL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/μL •Once ANC ≥1500/μL, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/μL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥1000/μL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/μL •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1500/μL Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25 to 50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline ≥1000/μL ) •Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment •If treatment interrupted −< 30 days, continue monitoring as before −≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia 500 to 999/μL Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/μL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours •Recommend hematology consultation •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1000/μL or ≥ patient’s known baseline •Once ANC ≥ 1000/μL or at patient’s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal BEN Range” ANC monitoring interval.If clinically appropriate BEN Severe Neutropenia less than 500/μL •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine- induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥500/μL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ patient’s baseline •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1000/μL or at patient’s baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia •Fever: Interrupt clozapine as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. •ANC less than 1000/μL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/μL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. •Consider hematology consultation. •See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/μL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g. patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine tablets or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment the guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: •Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training •Patients who receive clozapine must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements •Pharmacies dispensing clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10 week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning] . 5.7. Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/μL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Normal (< 100 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) to Fasting Glucose High (≥ 126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) to High (≥ 126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with clozapine can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) (2.6, 7.1). •Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended (2.6, 7.1). • Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued (2.6, 7.1). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine tablets dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine tablets are coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 7.2 Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYPD26 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur (5.7). • QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) (5.8). • Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: • Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes (5.9). • Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (5.9). • Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain (5.9). • Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions (5.10). • Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS (5.11). • Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur (5.12). • Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) (5.13). • Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles (5.14). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/μL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥)1500/μL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient’s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level Clozapine Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (≥1500/μL) •Initiate treatment •If treatment interrupted: −< 30 days, continue monitoring as before −≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/μL) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/μL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/μL •Once ANC ≥1500/μL, return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring intervalIf clinically appropriate Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/μL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine induced neutropenia •Resume treatment once ANC ≥1000/μL •Daily until ANC ≥1000/μL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/μL •Once ANC ≥1500/μL, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/μL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥1000/μL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/μL •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1500/μL Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25 to 50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline ≥1000/μL ) •Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment •If treatment interrupted −< 30 days, continue monitoring as before −≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia 500 to 999/μL Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/μL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours •Recommend hematology consultation •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1000/μL or ≥ patient’s known baseline •Once ANC ≥ 1000/μL or at patient’s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal BEN Range” ANC monitoring interval.If clinically appropriate BEN Severe Neutropenia less than 500/μL •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine- induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥500/μL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ patient’s baseline •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1000/μL or at patient’s baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia •Fever: Interrupt clozapine as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. •ANC less than 1000/μL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/μL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. •Consider hematology consultation. •See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/μL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g. patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine tablets or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment the guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: •Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training •Patients who receive clozapine must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements •Pharmacies dispensing clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10 week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning] . 5.7. Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/μL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Normal (< 100 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) to Fasting Glucose High (≥ 126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) to High (≥ 126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with clozapine can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine tablets dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) (2.6, 7.1). • Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. (2.6, 7.1) • Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine tablets dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued (2.6, 7.1). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine tablets Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the Clozapine Tablets dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine tablets is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine tablets is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. 7.2 Potential for Clozapine Tablets to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine tablets with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYPD26 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: • Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. • Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. • Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. • Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. • Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. • Eosinophilia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. • QT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. • Metabolic Changes (Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemia, and Weight Gain) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. • Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. • Fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. • Pulmonary Embolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. • Anticholinergic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. • Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. • Tardive Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. • Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)]. • Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)]. Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) were: CNS reactions (sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor); cardiovascular reactions (tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope); autonomic nervous system reactions (hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances); gastrointestinal reactions (constipation and nausea); and fever (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5%) across clozapine tablets clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5%) in clozapine tablets-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in Clozapine-treated patients at a frequency of 2% or greater across all clozapine tablets studies (excluding the 2-year InterSePT™ Study). These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. clozapine-8 clozapine-9 clozapine-10 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and periorbital edema.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. (5.7). • QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) (5.8). • Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/ cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: o Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. (5.9). o Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. (5.9). o Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. (5.9). • Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. (5.10). • Fever: Evaluate for infection, and for neutropenia, NMS (5.11). • Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest, pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur (5.12). • Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) (5.13). • Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles (5.14). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine tablets can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis.Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine tablets and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine tablet causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent.Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine tablets Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with CLOZARIL to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/μL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥) 1500/μL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient’s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: Clozapine tablets Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population Clozapine tablets Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine tablets Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia Fever: Interrupt CLOZARIL as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. ANC less than 1000/μL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/μL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. Consider hematology consultation. See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/μL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g. patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine tablet or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine tablet rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine tablets with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment the guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. clozapine-2 clozapine-3 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine tablet is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: • Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine tablet must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training • Patients who receive clozapine tablet must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements • Pharmacies dispensing clozapine tablet must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine tablet Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine tablets (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Use clozapine tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine tablets use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine tablets. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine tablets. However, if the benefit of clozapine tablets treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine tablets in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine tablets who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine tablets. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine tablets is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [See Boxed Warning]. 5.7 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/μL, has occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine tablets treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine tablets-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine tablets immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine tablets is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine tablets. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue Clozapine Tablets under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine tablets therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine tablets treatment. When prescribing clozapine tablets, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine tablets if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine tablets. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine tablets. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine tablets. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine tablets should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the Clozapine Tablets group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine tablets doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine. Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine tablets, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine tablets group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine tablets group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine tablets treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6.The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine tablets and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine tablets dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with the use of antipsychotics, including clozapine tablets. Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine tablets. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine tablets and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine tablets, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 8 summarizes pooled data from 11 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia demonstrating weight gain ≥ 7% of body weight relative to baseline. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine tablets, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. clozapine-4 clozapine-5 clozapine-16 clozapine-6 clozapine-7 5.10 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Antipsychotic drugs including clozapine tablets can cause a potentially fatal symptom complex referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever).The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine tablets monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine tablets has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine tablets can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with clozapine tablets can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine tablets can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine tablets does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine tablets. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine tablets in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine tablets despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for Clozapine Tablets or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine tablets should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine Tablets If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine tablets is necessary (because of agranulocytosis or another medical condition, for example), monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce CLOZARIL dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin). (2.6, 7.1) Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended. (2.6, 7.1) Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing CLOZARIL dose when CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued. (2.6, 7.1) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect CLOZARIL Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering CLOZARIL concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of CLOZARIL and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the CLOZARIL dose to one-third of the original dose when CLOZARIL is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The CLOZARIL dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when CLOZARIL is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the CLOZARIL dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with CLOZARIL and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the CLOZARIL dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of CLOZARIL. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the CLOZARIL dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of CLOZARIL and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Consider reducing the CLOZARIL dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 7.2 Potential for CLOZARIL to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of CLOZARIL with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering CLOZARIL with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur. (5.7) QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs). (5.8) Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. (5.9) Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. (5.9) Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain. (5.9) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions. (5.10) Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS. (5.11) Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur. (5.12) Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs). (5.13) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles. (5.14) 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background CLOZARIL can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/µL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking CLOZARIL and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which CLOZARIL causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. CLOZARIL Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with CLOZARIL to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/µL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥)1500/µL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient’s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/µL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/µL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: CLOZARIL Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population * Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours ** If clinically appropriate ANC Level CLOZARIL Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (≥1500/µL) Initiate treatment If treatment interrupted: < 30 days, continue monitoring as before ≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/µL)* Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL Once ANC ≥1500/µL, return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval** Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL)* Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine induced neutropenia Resume treatment once ANC ≥1000/µL Daily until ANC ≥1000/µL, then Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL Once ANC ≥1500/µL, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval** Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL)* Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC ≥1000/µL, then Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1500/µL CLOZARIL Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing CLOZARIL-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during CLOZARIL treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for CLOZARIL management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing CLOZARIL treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); CLOZARIL Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring * Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours ** If clinically appropriate ANC Level CLOZARIL Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline ≥1000/µL ) Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment If treatment interrupted < 30 days, continue monitoring as before ≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia 500 to 999/µL* Recommend hematology consultation Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1000/µL or ≥ patient’s known baseline Once ANC ≥ 1000/µL or at patient’s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal BEN Range” ANC monitoring interval.** BEN Severe Neutropenia less than 500/µL* Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC ≥500/µL, then Three times weekly until ANC ≥ patient’s baseline If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1000/µL or at patient’s baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia Fever: Interrupt CLOZARIL as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. ANC less than 1000/µL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/µL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. Consider hematology consultation. See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/µL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe CLOZARIL-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing CLOZARIL treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than CLOZARIL). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with CLOZARIL or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of CLOZARIL rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using CLOZARIL with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of CLOZARIL-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid CLOZARIL treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If CLOZARIL is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program CLOZARIL is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: Healthcare professionals who prescribe CLOZARIL must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training Patients who receive CLOZARIL must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements Pharmacies dispensing CLOZARIL must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive CLOZARIL Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off CLOZARIL (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Use CLOZARIL cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at 1 year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of 1 or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering CLOZARIL to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with CLOZARIL use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of CLOZARIL. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue CLOZARIL and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with CLOZARIL. However, if the benefit of CLOZARIL treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with CLOZARIL in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving CLOZARIL who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with CLOZARIL. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. CLOZARIL is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning]. 5.7 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/µL, has occurred with CLOZARIL treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during CLOZARIL treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If CLOZARIL-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue CLOZARIL immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to CLOZARIL is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue CLOZARIL. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue CLOZARIL under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt CLOZARIL therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with CLOZARIL treatment. When prescribing CLOZARIL, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with CLOZARIL, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue CLOZARIL if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes, or other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue CLOZARIL. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of CLOZARIL. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of CLOZARIL [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with CLOZARIL. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including CLOZARIL have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including CLOZARIL. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on CLOZARIL should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the CLOZARIL and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the CLOZARIL group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The CLOZARIL doses were 100–900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for CLOZARIL and chlorpromazine. Table 4.

Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using CLOZARIL, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, CLOZARIL treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the CLOZARIL group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, CLOZARIL treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the CLOZARIL group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, CLOZARIL treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of CLOZARIL and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The CLOZARIL dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with CLOZARIL. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with CLOZARIL and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the CLOZARIL, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with CLOZARIL monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with CLOZARIL. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity CLOZARIL has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with CLOZARIL can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with CLOZARIL can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance CLOZARIL can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that CLOZARIL does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including CLOZARIL. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe CLOZARIL in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with CLOZARIL despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for CLOZARIL or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. CLOZARIL should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of CLOZARIL If abrupt discontinuation of CLOZARIL is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce VERSACLOZ dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) (2.7, 7.1). •Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended (2.7, 7.1) • Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing VERSACLOZ dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued (2.7, 7.1). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect VERSACLOZ Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering VERSACLOZ concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of VERSACLOZ and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the VERSACLOZ dose to one third of the original dose when VERSACLOZ is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The VERSACLOZ dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when VERSACLOZ is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the VERSACLOZ dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with VERSACLOZ and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the VERSACLOZ dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of VERSACLOZ. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the VERSACLOZ dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of VERSACLOZ and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Consider reducing the VERSACLOZ dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 7.2 Potential for VERSACLOZ to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of VERSACLOZ with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering VERSACLOZ with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

This was an adequate and well-controlled, two-year study evaluating the efficacy of clozapine relative to olanzapine in reducing the risk of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System Pseudopheochromocytoma. Gastrointestinal System Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur (5.7). • QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) (5.8). • Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: • Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes (5.9). • Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (5.9). • Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain (5.9). • Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions (5.10). • Fever: Evaluate for infection, and for neutropenia, NMS (5.11). • Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest, pain, or deep vein thrombosis occurs (5.12). • Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) (5.13). • Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles (5.14). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background VERSACLOZ can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count [ANC]), defined as a reduction below pretreatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/µL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking VERSACLOZ and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which VERSACLOZ causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. VERSACLOZ Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/µL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥) 1500/µL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient's ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/µL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/µL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: VERSACLOZ Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level VERSACLOZ Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (≥1500/µL) •Initiate treatment •If treatment interrupted: •<30 days, continue monitoring as before •≥30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/µL)* •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL •Once ANC ≥1500/µL, return to patient's last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval** Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL)* •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Resume treatment once ANC ≥1000/µL •Daily until ANC ≥1000/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL •Once ANC ≥1500/µL, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient's last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval** Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL)* •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥1000/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1500/µL * Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours ** If clinically appropriate VERSACLOZ Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during VERSACLOZ treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for VERSACLOZ management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing VERSACLOZ treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); VERSACLOZ Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline ≥1000/µL) •Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment •If treatment interrupted: •<30 days, continue monitoring as before •≥30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL)* •Recommend hematology consultation •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1000/µL or ≥patient's known baseline •Once ANC ≥1000/µL or at patient's known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient's last “Normal BEN Range” ANC monitoring interval** BEN Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL)* •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥500/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥patient's baseline •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1000/µL or at patient's baseline * Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours ** If clinically appropriate General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia • Fever: Interrupt VERSACLOZ as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. • ANC less than 1000/µL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/µL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. • Consider hematology consultation. • See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Fever under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/µL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe VERSACLOZ-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing VERSACLOZ treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than VERSACLOZ). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with VERSACLOZ or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient's medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of VERSACLOZ rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using VERSACLOZ with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid VERSACLOZ treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If VERSACLOZ is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program VERSACLOZ is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: • Healthcare professionals who prescribe VERSACLOZ must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. • Patients who receive VERSACLOZ must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements. • Pharmacies dispensing VERSACLOZ must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive VERSACLOZ. Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off VERSACLOZ (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Use VERSACLOZ cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering VERSACLOZ to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with VERSACLOZ use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue VERSACLOZ and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with VERSACLOZ. However, if the benefit of VERSACLOZ treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with VERSACLOZ in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving VERSACLOZ who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with VERSACLOZ. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. VERSACLOZ is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning]. 5.7 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/μL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during VERSACLOZ treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue VERSACLOZ immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue VERSACLOZ. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue VERSACLOZ under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt VERSACLOZ therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing VERSACLOZ, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of VERSACLOZ, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue VERSACLOZ if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue VERSACLOZ. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmic (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). VERSACLOZ is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of VERSACLOZ [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including VERSACLOZ, have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including VERSACLOZ. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on VERSACLOZ should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (<100 mg/dL) to High (≥126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (≥126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including VERSACLOZ. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using VERSACLOZ, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity VERSACLOZ has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with VERSACLOZ can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with VERSACLOZ can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance VERSACLOZ can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that VERSACLOZ does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including VERSACLOZ. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe VERSACLOZ in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with VERSACLOZ despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for VERSACLOZ or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. VERSACLOZ should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of VERSACLOZ If abrupt discontinuation of VERSACLOZ is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) (2.6, 7.1). •Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended (2.6, 7.1). • Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued (2.6, 7.1). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine tablets dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine tablets are coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Consider reducing the clozapine tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 7.2 Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYPD26 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 5%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 5%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6 week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur (5.7). • QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) (5.8). • Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: • Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes (5.9). • Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (5.9). • Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain (5.9). • Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions (5.10). • Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS (5.11). • Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur (5.12). • Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) (5.13). • Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles (5.14). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/μL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥)1500/μL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient’s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level Clozapine Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (≥1500/μL) •Initiate treatment •If treatment interrupted: •< 30 days, continue monitoring as before •≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/μL) •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/μL •Once ANC ≥1500/μL, return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/μL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine induced neutropenia •Resume treatment once ANC ≥1000/μL •Daily until ANC ≥1000/μL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/μL •Once ANC ≥1500/μL, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/μL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥1000/μL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/μL •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1500/μL Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25 to 50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline ≥1000/μL ) •Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment •If treatment interrupted •< 30 days, continue monitoring as before •≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia 500 to 999/μL •Recommend hematology consultation •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1000/μL or ≥ patient’s known baseline •Once ANC ≥ 1000/μL or at patient’s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal BEN Range” ANC monitoring interval. BEN Severe Neutropenia less than 500/μL 1 •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine- induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥500/μL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ patient’s baseline •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1000/μL or at patient’s baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia •Fever: Interrupt clozapine as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. •ANC less than 1000/μL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/μL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. •Consider hematology consultation. •See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/μL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g. patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine tablets or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment the guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: •Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training •Patients who receive clozapine must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements •Pharmacies dispensing clozapine must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10 week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning] . 5.7. Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/μL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine tablets. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Normal (< 100 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) to Fasting Glucose High (≥ 126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) to High (≥ 126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine tablets. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with clozapine can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce Clozapine ODT dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) (2.7, 7.1). • Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended (2.7, 7.1). • Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing Clozapine ODT dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued (2.7, 7.1). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine ODT Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of Clozapine ODT and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the Clozapine ODT dose to one third of the original dose when Clozapine ODT is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The Clozapine ODT dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when Clozapine ODT is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with Clozapine ODT and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase Clozapine ODT levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of Clozapine ODT. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the Clozapine ODT dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of Clozapine ODT and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Consider reducing the Clozapine ODT dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of Clozapine ODT. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 7.2 Potential for Clozapine ODT to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of Clozapine ODT with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering Clozapine ODT with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥5%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11: Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT™ Study (≥10% in the clozapine or olanzapine group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine N=479 % Reporting Olanzapine N=477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48% 6% Somnolence 46% 25% Weight increased 31% 56% Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27% 12% Constipation 25% 10% Insomnia 20% 33% Nausea 17% 10% Vomiting 17% 9% Dyspepsia 14% 8% Dystonia Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur (5.7). • QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) (5.8). • Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: • Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes (5.9). • Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (5.9). • Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain (5.9). • Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions (5.10). • Fever: Evaluate for infection and neutropenia, NMS (5.11). • Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest, pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occurs (5.12). • Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) (5.13). • Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles (5.14). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine ODT can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count [ANC]), defined as a reduction below pretreatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/µL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking Clozapine ODT and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which Clozapine ODT causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine ODT Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2 ) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with Clozapine ODT to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/µL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥) 1500/µL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient’s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/µL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/µL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: Clozapine ODT Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level Clozapine ODT Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (≥1500/µL) • Initiate treatment • If treatment interrupted: - <30 days, continue monitoring as before - ≥30 days, monitor as if new patient • Weekly from initiation to 6 months • Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months • Monthly after 12 months • Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia • See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/µL)* • Continue treatment • Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL • Once ANC ≥1500/µL, return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval** Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL)* • Recommend hematology consultation • Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia • Resume treatment once ANC ≥1000/µL • Daily until ANC ≥1000/µL, then • Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL • Once ANC ≥1500/µL, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval** Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL)* • Recommend hematology consultation • Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia • Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks • Daily until ANC ≥1000/µL, then • Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL • If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1500/µL * Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours ** If clinically appropriate Clozapine ODT Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing Clozapine ODT-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during Clozapine ODT treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for Clozapine ODT management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing Clozapine ODT treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine ODT Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline ≥1000/µL) • Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment • If treatment interrupted - <30 days, continue monitoring as before - ≥30 days, monitor as if new patient • Weekly from initiation to 6 months • Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months • Monthly after 12 months • Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia • See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL)* • Recommend hematology consultation • Continue treatment • Three times weekly until ANC ≥1000/µL or ≥ patient’s known baseline • Once ANC ≥1000/µL or at patient’s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal BEN Range” ANC monitoring interval.** BEN Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL)* • Recommend hematology consultation • Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia • Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks • Daily until ANC ≥500/µL, then • Three times weekly until ANC ≥ patient’s baseline • If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1000/µL or at patient’s baseline * Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours ** If clinically appropriate General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia • Fever: Interrupt Clozapine ODT as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5ºC [101.3ºF] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. • ANC less than 1000/µL: If fever occurs in any patient with a ANC less than 1000/µL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. • Consider hematology consultation. • See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Fever under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 ) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION ( 17 ). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/µL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe Clozapine ODT-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing Clozapine ODT treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than Clozapine ODT). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with Clozapine ODT or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of Clozapine ODT rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine ODT with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of Clozapine ODT-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid Clozapine ODT treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If Clozapine ODT is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine ODT is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: • Healthcare professionals who prescribe Clozapine ODT must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. • Patients who receive Clozapine ODT must enroll in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements. • Pharmacies dispensing Clozapine ODT must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive Clozapine ODT. Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off Clozapine ODT (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Use Clozapine ODT cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering Clozapine ODT to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with Clozapine ODT use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue Clozapine ODT and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with Clozapine ODT. However, if the benefit of Clozapine ODT treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with Clozapine ODT in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving Clozapine ODT who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with Clozapine ODT. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine ODT is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning]. 5.7 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/µL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during Clozapine ODT treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue Clozapine ODT immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue Clozapine ODT. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue Clozapine ODT under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt Clozapine ODT therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing Clozapine ODT, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of Clozapine ODT, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with Clozapine ODT, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue Clozapine ODT if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue Clozapine ODT. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of Clozapine ODT. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine ODT is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of Clozapine ODT [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with Clozapine ODT. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Clozapine ODT have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including Clozapine ODT. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on Clozapine ODT should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (<100 mg/dL) to High (≥126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (≥126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including Clozapine ODT. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using Clozapine ODT, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Monitor weight during treatment with Clozapine ODT. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep-vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine ODT has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with Clozapine ODT can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with Clozapine ODT can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine ODT can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Clozapine ODT does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including Clozapine ODT. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe Clozapine ODT in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with Clozapine ODT despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that Clozapine ODT contains phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 12.5 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 0.87 mg phenylalanine. Each 25 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.74 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 6.96 mg phenylalanine. Each 150 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 10.44 mg phenylalanine. Each 200 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 13.92 mg phenylalanine. 5.17 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for Clozapine ODT or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine ODT should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.18 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine ODT If abrupt discontinuation of Clozapine ODT is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) (2.6, 7.1). •Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended (2.6, 7.1). • Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued (2.6, 7.1). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine dose to one third of the original dose when clozapine is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Consider reducing the clozapine dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 7.2 Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 5%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 5%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System: Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System: Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System: Pseudopheochromocytoma. Gastrointestinal System: Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling. Hepatobiliary System: Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur (5.7). • QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) (5.8). • Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: o Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes (5.9). o Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (5.9). o Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain (5.9). • Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions (5.10). • Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS (5.11). • Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur (5.12). • Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) (5.13). • Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles (5.14). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/μL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥) 1500/μL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient’s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2. Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level Clozapine Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (≥ 1500/μL) •Initiate treatment •If treatment interrupted: -< 30 days, continue monitoring as before -≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/μL) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1500/μL •Once ANC ≥ 1500/μL, return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring intervalIf clinically appropriate Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine induced neutropenia •Resume treatment once ANC ≥ 1000/µL •Daily until ANC ≥ 1000/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1500/µL •Once ANC ≥ 1500/µL, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥ 1000/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1500/µL •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥ 1500/µL Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3. Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline ≥ 1000/µL) •Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment •If treatment interrupted: -< 30 days, continue monitoring as before -≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours •Recommend hematology consultation •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1000/µL or ≥ patient’s known baseline •Once ANC ≥ 1000/µL, or at patient’s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal BEN Range” ANC monitoring intervalIf clinically appropriate BEN Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥ 500/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ patient’s baseline •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥ 1000/µL or at patient’s baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia • Fever: Interrupt clozapine as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. • ANC less than 1000/µL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/µL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. • Consider hematology consultation. • See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/µL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g. patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment the guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine tablets are only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: • Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training • Patients who receive clozapine tablets must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements • Pharmacies dispensing clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine tablets Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1,743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning]. 5.7 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/μL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of eight studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were + 11 mg/dL and + 4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 mg to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4. Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (< 100 mg/dL) to High (≥ 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (≥ 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of ten studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with clozapine can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose to one-third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) (2.7, 7.1). •Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended (2.7, 7.1). • Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued (2.7, 7.1). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine orally disintegrating tablets concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose to one third of the original dose when clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Consider reducing the clozapine orally disintegrating tablets dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 7.2 Potential for Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine orally disintegrating tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 5%) across clozapine clinical trials were: CNS reactions, including sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache, and tremor; cardiovascular reactions, including tachycardia, hypotension, and syncope; autonomic nervous system reactions, including hypersalivation, sweating, dry mouth, and visual disturbances; gastrointestinal reactions, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Table 9 summarizes the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 5%) in clozapine-treated patients (compared to chlorpromazine-treated patients) in the pivotal, 6-week, controlled trial in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

The rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure. Table 11: Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with Clozapine or Olanzapine in the InterSePT™ Study (≥ 10% in the Clozapine or Olanzapine Group) Adverse Reactions Clozapine N = 479 % Reporting Olanzapine N = 477 % Reporting Salivary hypersecretion 48% 6% Somnolence 46% 25% Weight increased 31% 56% Dizziness (excluding vertigo) 27% 12% Constipation 25% 10% Insomnia 20% 33% Nausea 17% 10% Vomiting 17% 9% Dyspepsia 14% 8% Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System: Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System: Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and periorbital edema.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur (5.7). • QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) (5.8). • Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: • Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes (5.9). • Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (5.9). • Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain (5.9). • Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions (5.10). • Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS (5.11). • Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur (5.12). • Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) (5.13). • Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles (5.14). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count [ANC]), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/μL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥) 1500/μL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient’s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level Clozapine Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (≥ 1500/μL) •Initiate treatment •If treatment interrupted: •< 30 days, continue monitoring as before •≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.5 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/μL) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1500/μL •Once ANC ≥ 1500/μL, return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval If clinically appropriate Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine induced neutropenia •Resume treatment once ANC ≥ 1000/µL •Daily until ANC ≥ 1000/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1500/µL •Once ANC ≥ 1500/µL, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥ 1000/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1500/µL •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥ 1500/µL Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline ≥ 1000/µL) •Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment •If treatment interrupted: •< 30 days, continue monitoring as before •≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.5 BEN Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours •Recommend hematology consultation •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1000/µL or ≥ patient’s known baseline •Once ANC ≥ 1000/µL, or at patient’s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal BEN Range” ANC monitoring interval If clinically appropriate BEN Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL) •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥ 500/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥ patient’s baseline •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥ 1000/µL or at patient’s baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia • Fever: Interrupt clozapine orally disintegrating tablets as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. • ANC less than 1000/µL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/µL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. • Consider hematology consultation. • See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/µL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine orally disintegrating tablets). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: • Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine orally disintegrating tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training • Patients who receive clozapine orally disintegrating tablets must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements • Pharmacies dispensing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine orally disintegrating tablets Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine orally disintegrating tablets (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Use clozapine orally disintegrating tablets cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1,743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine orally disintegrating tablets to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. However, if the benefit of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine orally disintegrating tablets who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first 2 months of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning]. 5.7 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/μL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine orally disintegrating tablets treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine orally disintegrating tablets therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine orally disintegrating tablets should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of eight studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 mg to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia Laboratory Parameter Category Change (at least once) from Baseline Treatment Arm N n (%) Fasting Glucose Normal (< 100 mg/dL) to High (≥ 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10) Borderline (100 to 125 mg/dL) to High (≥ 126 mg/dL) Clozapine 57 24 (42) Chlorpromazine 43 12 (28) Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including clozapine. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine orally disintegrating tablets, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of two studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets have potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine orally disintegrating tablets do not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine orally disintegrating tablets in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine orally disintegrating tablets despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that clozapine orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 25 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.90 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 7.59 mg phenylalanine. 5.17 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine orally disintegrating tablets or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine orally disintegrating tablets should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.18 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound After Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine orally disintegrating tablets is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce FAZACLO dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) (2.7, 7.1). •Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended (2.7, 7.1). • Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing FAZACLO dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued (2.7, 7.1). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect FAZACLO Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering FAZACLO concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of FAZACLO and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the FAZACLO dose to one third of the original dose when FAZACLO is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The FAZACLO dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when FAZACLO is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the FAZACLO dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with FAZACLO and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the FAZACLO dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of FAZACLO. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the FAZACLO dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of FAZACLO and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Consider reducing the FAZACLO dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of FAZACLO. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 7.2 Potential for FAZACLO to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of FAZACLO with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering FAZACLO with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur (5.7). • QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) (5.8). • Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: • Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes (5.9). • Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (5.9). • Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain (5.9). • Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions (5.10). • Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS (5.11). • Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep vein thrombosis occurs (5.12). • Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) (5.13). • Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles (5.14). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background FAZACLO can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count [ANC]), defined as a reduction below pretreatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/µL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking FAZACLO and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which FAZACLO causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. FAZACLO Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with FAZACLO to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/µL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥) 1500/µL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient's ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/µL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/µL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2: FAZACLO Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level FAZACLO Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (≥1500/µL) •Initiate treatment •If treatment interrupted: •<30 days, continue monitoring as before •≥30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/µL)* •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL •Once ANC ≥1500/µL, return to patient's last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval** Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL)* •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Resume treatment once ANC ≥1000/µL •Daily until ANC ≥1000/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL •Once ANC ≥1500/µL, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient's last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval** Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL)* •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥1000/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1500/µL •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1500/µL * Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours ** If clinically appropriate FAZACLO Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing FAZACLO-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during FAZACLO treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for FAZACLO management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing FAZACLO treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); FAZACLO Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline ≥1000/µL) •Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment •If treatment interrupted: •<30 days, continue monitoring as before •≥30 days, monitor as if new patient •Weekly from initiation to 6 months •Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months •Monthly after 12 months •Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia •See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL)* •Recommend hematology consultation •Continue treatment •Three times weekly until ANC ≥1000/µL or ≥patient's known baseline •Once ANC ≥1000/µL or at patient's known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient's last “Normal BEN Range” ANC monitoring interval** BEN Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL)* •Recommend hematology consultation •Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia •Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks •Daily until ANC ≥500/µL, then •Three times weekly until ANC ≥patient's baseline •If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥1000/µL or at patient's baseline * Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours ** If clinically appropriate General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia • Fever: Interrupt FAZACLO as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. • ANC less than 1000/µL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/µL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. • Consider hematology consultation. • See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Fever under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/µL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe FAZACLO-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing FAZACLO treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than FAZACLO). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with FAZACLO or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient's medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of FAZACLO rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using FAZACLO with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of FAZACLO-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid FAZACLO treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If FAZACLO is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program FAZACLO is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: • Healthcare professionals who prescribe FAZACLO must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. • Patients who receive FAZACLO must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements. • Pharmacies dispensing FAZACLO must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive FAZACLO. Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off FAZACLO (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Use FAZACLO cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering FAZACLO to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with FAZACLO use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue FAZACLO and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with FAZACLO. However, if the benefit of FAZACLO treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with FAZACLO in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving FAZACLO who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with FAZACLO. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. FAZACLO is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning]. 5.7 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/µL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during FAZACLO treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue FAZACLO immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue FAZACLO. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue FAZACLO under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt FAZACLO therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing FAZACLO, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of FAZACLO, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with FAZACLO, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue FAZACLO if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue FAZACLO. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of FAZACLO. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). FAZACLO is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of FAZACLO [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with FAZACLO. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including FAZACLO, have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including FAZACLO. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on FAZACLO should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and +4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine.

Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using FAZACLO, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.

Monitor weight during treatment with FAZACLO. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity FAZACLO has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with FAZACLO can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with FAZACLO can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance FAZACLO can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that FAZACLO does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including FAZACLO. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe FAZACLO in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with FAZACLO despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that FAZACLO contains phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 12.5 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 0.87 mg phenylalanine. Each 25 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.74 mg phenylalanine. Each 100 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 6.96 mg phenylalanine. Each 150 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 10.44 mg phenylalanine. Each 200 mg, orally disintegrating tablet contains 13.92 mg phenylalanine. 5.17 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for FAZACLO or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. FAZACLO should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.18 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of FAZACLO If abrupt discontinuation of FAZACLO is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea."

        "Drug Interactions The risks of using CLOZARIL in combination with other drugs have not been systematically evaluated. Pharmacodynamic -Related Interactions The mechanism of CLOZARIL-induced agranulocytosis is unknown; nonetheless, the possibility that causative factors may interact synergistically to increase the risk and/or severity of bone marrow suppression warrants consideration. Therefore, CLOZARIL should not be used with other agents having a well-known potential to suppress bone marrow function. Given the primary CNS effects of CLOZARIL, caution is advised in using it concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs or alcohol. Orthostatic hypotension in patients taking clozapine can, in rare cases (approximately 1 case per 3,000 patients), be accompanied by profound collapse and respiratory and/or cardiac arrest. Some of the cases of collapse/respiratory arrest/cardiac arrest during initial treatment occurred in patients who were being administered benzodiazepines; similar events have been reported in patients taking other psychotropic drugs or even CLOZARIL by itself. Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between CLOZARIL and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when clozapine is initiated in patients taking a benzodiazepine or any other psychotropic drug. CLOZARIL may potentiate the hypotensive effects of antihypertensive drugs and the anticholinergic effects of atropine -type drugs. The administration of epinephrine should be avoided in the treatment of drug -induced hypotension because of a possible reverse epinephrine effect. Pharmacokinetic -Related Interactions Clozapine is a substrate for many CYP450 isozymes, in particular 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. The risk of metabolic interactions caused by an effect on an individual isoform is therefore minimized. Nevertheless, caution should be used in patients receiving concomitant treatment with other drugs that are either inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes. Concomitant administration of drugs known to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes may decrease the plasma levels of clozapine. Phenytoin, nicotine, and rifampin may decrease CLOZARIL plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective CLOZARIL dose. Concomitant administration of drugs known to inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 isozymes may increase the plasma levels of clozapine. Cimetidine, caffeine, citalopram, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of CLOZARIL, potentially resulting in adverse effects. Although concomitant use of CLOZARIL and carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in CLOZARIL plasma levels. In a study of schizophrenic patients who received clozapine under steady-state conditions, fluvoxamine or paroxetine was added in 16 and 14 patients, respectively. After 14 days of coadministration, mean trough concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites, N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine N-oxide, were elevated with fluvoxamine by about three-fold compared to baseline concentrations. Paroxetine produced only minor changes in the levels of clozapine and its metabolites. However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when clozapine was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline. Therefore, such combined treatment should be approached with caution and patients should be monitored closely when CLOZARIL is combined with these drugs, particularly with fluvoxamine. A reduced CLOZARIL dose should be considered. A subset (3%-10%) of the population has reduced activity of certain drug metabolizing enzymes such as the cytochrome P450 isozyme P450 2D6. Such individuals are referred to as “poor metabolizers” of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, the tricyclic antidepressants, and clozapine. These individuals may develop higher than expected plasma concentrations of clozapine when given usual doses. In addition, certain drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including many antidepressants (clozapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and others), may inhibit the activity of this isozyme, and thus may make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers with regard to concomitant therapy with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system, leading to drug interaction. Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either clozapine or the other drug. Therefore, coadministration of clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Sixteen percent of 1,080 patients who received CLOZARIL® (clozapine) in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, including both those that could be reasonably attributed to CLOZARIL treatment and those that might more appropriately be considered intercurrent illness. The more common events considered to be causes of discontinuation included: CNS, primarily drowsiness/sedation, seizures, dizziness/syncope; cardiovascular, primarily tachycardia, hypotension and ECG changes; gastrointestinal, primarily nausea/vomiting; hematologic, primarily leukopenia/ granulocytopenia/ agranulocytosis; and fever. None of the events enumerated accounts for more than 1.7% of all discontinuations attributed to adverse clinical events. Extrapyramidal Symptoms Dystonia Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is associated with a low incidence of dystonia (see WARNINGS, Tardive Dyskinesia). Commonly Observed Adverse events observed in association with the use of CLOZARIL in clinical trials at an incidence of greater than 5% were: central nervous system complaints, including drowsiness/sedation, dizziness/vertigo, headache and tremor; autonomic nervous system complaints, including salivation, sweating, dry mouth and visual disturbances; cardiovascular findings, including tachycardia, hypotension and syncope; and gastrointestinal complaints, including constipation and nausea; and fever. Complaints of drowsiness/sedation tend to subside with continued therapy or dose reduction. Salivation may be profuse, especially during sleep, but may be diminished with dose reduction. Incidence in Clinical Trials The following table enumerates adverse events that occurred at a frequency of 1% or greater among CLOZARIL patients who participated in clinical trials. These rates are not adjusted for duration of exposure.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Reduce clozapine dose to one third when coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin) ( 2.6, 7.1). Concomitant use of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers is not recommended ( 2.6, 7.1). Discontinuation of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider reducing clozapine dose when CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco smoke) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) are discontinued ( 2.6, 7.1). 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clozapine Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes. CYP1A2 Inhibitors Concomitant use of clozapine and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine dose to one third of the original dose when clozapine is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients closely when clozapine is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant treatment with clozapine and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . Consider reducing the clozapine dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . 7.2 Potential for Clozapine to Affect Other Drugs Concomitant use of clozapine with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels of these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering clozapine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than usually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide)."

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Central Nervous System: Delirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, obsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions. Cardiovascular System: Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and periorbital edema. Endocrine System: Pseudopheochromocytoma. Gastrointestinal System: Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling. Hepatobiliary System: Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Eosinophilia: Assess for organ involvement (e.g., myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis). Discontinue if these occur ( 5.7). QT Interval Prolongation: Can be fatal. Consider additional risk factors for prolonged QT interval (disorders and drugs) ( 5.8). Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include: Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes ( 5.9). Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics ( 5.9). Weight Gain: Significant weight gain has occurred. Monitor weight gain (5.9). Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Immediately discontinue and monitor closely. Assess for co-morbid conditions ( 5.10). Fever: Evaluate for infection and for neutropenia, NMS ( 5.11). Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Consider PE if respiratory distress, chest pain, or deep-vein thrombosis occur ( 5.12). Anticholinergic Toxicity: Use cautiously in presence of specific conditions (e.g., narrow angle glaucoma, use of anticholinergic drugs) ( 5.13). Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Advise caution when operating machinery, including automobiles ( 5.14). 5.1 Severe Neutropenia Background Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis. Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL,occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent. Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia. Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2) Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/μL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥) 1500/μL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient’s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter. Table 2. Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population ANC Level Clozapine Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal range (≥ 1500/μL) Initiate treatment If treatment interrupted: < 30 days, continue monitoring as before ≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.4 Mild Neutropenia (1000 to 1499/μL) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1500/μL Once ANC ≥ 1500/μL, return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval If clinically appropriate Moderate Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL) Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine induced neutropenia Resume treatment once ANC ≥ 1000/µL Daily until ANC ≥ 1000/µL, then Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1500/µL Once ANC ≥ 1500/µL, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal Range” ANC monitoring interval Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL) Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC ≥ 1000/µL, then Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1500/µL If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥ 1500/µL Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3) Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than “standard” laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary. Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN. Table 3. Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); Clozapine Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring ANC Level Treatment Recommendations ANC Monitoring Normal BEN Range (Established ANC baseline ≥ 1000/µL) Obtain at least two baseline ANC levels before initiating treatment If treatment interrupted: < 30 days, continue monitoring as before ≥ 30 days, monitor as if new patient Weekly from initiation to 6 months Every 2 weeks from 6 to 12 months Monthly after 12 months Discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than neutropenia See Section 2.4 BEN Neutropenia (500 to 999/µL) Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/µL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours Recommend hematology consultation Continue treatment Three times weekly until ANC ≥ 1000/µL or ≥ patient’s known baseline Once ANC ≥ 1000/µL, or at patient’s known baseline, check ANC weekly for 4 weeks, then return to patient’s last “Normal BEN Range” ANC monitoring interval If clinically appropriate BEN Severe Neutropenia (less than 500/µL) Recommend hematology consultation Interrupt treatment for suspected clozapine-induced neutropenia Do not rechallenge unless prescriber determines benefits outweigh risks Daily until ANC ≥ 500/µL, then Three times weekly until ANC ≥ patient’s baseline If patient rechallenged, resume treatment as a new patient under “Normal Range” monitoring once ANC ≥ 1000/µL or at patient’s baseline General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia Fever: Interrupt clozapine as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection. ANC less than 1000/µL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/µL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management. Consider hematology consultation. See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17). Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/µL (severe neutropenia) For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g. patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine or a clozapine product. If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode. Using Clozapine with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment the guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy. 5.2 Clozapine REMS Program Clozapine tablets are only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine REMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia. Notable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include: Healthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing trainingHealthcare professionals who prescribe clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training Patients who receive clozapine tablets must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirementsPatients who receive clozapine tablets must be enrolled in the program and comply with the ANC testing and monitoring requirements Pharmacies dispensing clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine tabletsPharmacies dispensing clozapine tablets must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive clozapine tablets Further information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be fatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB). Treatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to minimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Consider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Use clozapine cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of antihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia). 5.4 Seizures Seizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence at one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of 1,743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a crude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5 mg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing. Use caution when administering clozapine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of medications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of seizure associated with clozapine use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an automobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing). 5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be fatal. Discontinue clozapine and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or cardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with clozapine. However, if the benefit of clozapine treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with clozapine in consultation with a cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring. Consider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving clozapine who present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic findings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave progression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first 2 months of clozapine treatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated myocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy can occur at any period during treatment with clozapine. It is common for nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede more overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T, elevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Chest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. 5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in this population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Clozapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning] . 5.7 Eosinophilia Eosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/μL, has occurred with clozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia. Clozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some patients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis. Such organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). If eosinophilia develops during clozapine treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and symptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other organ-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is suspected, discontinue clozapine immediately. If a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen vascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and continue clozapine. Clozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can resolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of clozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue clozapine under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over several weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt clozapine therapy and rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical assessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist. 5.8 QT Interval Prolongation QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing clozapine, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious cardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, treatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, and electrolyte abnormalities. Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine, perform a careful physical examination, medical history, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum chemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue clozapine if the QT c interval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes or other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac evaluation and discontinue clozapine. Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Clozapine is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant treatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of clozapine [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk for significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements of serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct electrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with clozapine. 5.9 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine have been associated with metabolic changes that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs may produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including clozapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on clozapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. In a pooled data analysis of eight studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in fasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were + 11 mg/dL and + 4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical increases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group (Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100 mg to 900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day). The maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day). The median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine. Table 4.

Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using clozapine, is recommended. In a pooled data analysis of ten studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and HDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group and 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum triglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine treatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as illustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or fasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine and chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range was 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily. Table 5.

Monitor weight during treatment with clozapine. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the duration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median duration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and chlorpromazine group, respectively. Table 7.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can include elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection, heat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms, and drug fever). The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of comorbid medical conditions. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if restarting treatment with antipsychotics. NMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications, including lithium. 5.11 Fever During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] . 5.12 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep-vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear. 5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity Clozapine has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with clozapine can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle glaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. Treatment with clozapine can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including constipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be fatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary therapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more serious cases. 5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Clozapine can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clozapine does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur. 5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe clozapine in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically assess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs. However, some patients may require treatment with clozapine despite the presence of the syndrome. There is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely if treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of symptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown. 5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for clozapine or other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Clozapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions. 5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of Clozapine If abrupt discontinuation of clozapine is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or another medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] , monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse reactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea."
