        "Drug Interactions Effect of Rifabutin on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Rifabutin induces CYP3A enzymes and therefore may reduce the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by those enzymes. This effect may reduce the efficacy of standard doses of such drugs, which include itraconazole, clarithromycin, and saquinavir. Effect of Other Drugs on Rifabutin Pharmacokinetics Some drugs that inhibit CYP3A may significantly increase the plasma concentration of rifabutin. Therefore, carefully monitor for rifabutin associated adverse events in those patients also receiving CYP3A inhibitors, which include fluconazole and clarithromycin. In some cases, the dosage of MYCOBUTIN may need to be reduced when it is coadministered with CYP3A inhibitors. Table 2 summarizes the results and magnitude of the pertinent drug interactions assessed with rifabutin. The clinical relevance of these interactions and subsequent dose modifications should be judged in light of the population studied, severity of the disease, patient's drug profile, and the likely impact on the risk/benefit ratio.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials MYCOBUTIN Capsules were generally well tolerated in the controlled clinical trials. Discontinuation of therapy due to an adverse event was required in 16% of patients receiving MYCOBUTIN, compared to 8% of patients receiving placebo in these trials. Primary reasons for discontinuation of MYCOBUTIN were rash (4% of treated patients), gastrointestinal intolerance (3%), and neutropenia (2%). The following table enumerates adverse experiences that occurred at a frequency of 1% or greater, among the patients treated with MYCOBUTIN in studies 023 and 027. Table: 3 Clinical Adverse Experiences Reported in ≥1% of Patients Treated With MYCOBUTIN Adverse event MYCOBUTIN (n = 566) % Placebo (n = 580) % Body as a whole Abdominal pain 4 3 Asthenia 1 1 Chest pain 1 1 Fever 2 1 Headache 3 5 Pain 1 2 Blood and lymphatic system Leucopenia 10 7 Anemia 1 2 Digestive System Anorexia 2 2 Diarrhea 3 3 Dyspepsia 3 1 Eructation 3 1 Flatulence 2 1 Nausea 6 5 Nausea and vomiting 3 2 Vomiting 1 1 Musculoskeletal system Myalgia 2 1 Nervous system Insomnia 1 1 Skin and appendages Rash 11 8 Special senses Taste perversion 3 1 Urogenital system Discolored urine 30 6 CLINICAL ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTED IN <1% OF PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED MYCOBUTIN Considering data from the 023 and 027 pivotal trials, and from other clinical studies, MYCOBUTIN appears to be a likely cause of the following adverse events which occurred in less than 1% of treated patients: flu-like syndrome, hepatitis, hemolysis, arthralgia, myositis, chest pressure or pain with dyspnea, skin discoloration, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia and jaundice. The following adverse events have occurred in more than one patient receiving MYCOBUTIN, but an etiologic role has not been established: seizure, paresthesia, aphasia, confusion, and non-specific T wave changes on electrocardiogram. When MYCOBUTIN was administered at doses from 1050 mg/day to 2400 mg/day, generalized arthralgia and uveitis were reported. These adverse experiences abated when MYCOBUTIN was discontinued. Mild to severe, reversible uveitis has been reported less frequently when MYCOBUTIN is used at 300 mg as monotherapy in MAC prophylaxis versus MYCOBUTIN in combination with clarithromycin for MAC treatment (see also WARNINGS ). Uveitis has been infrequently reported when MYCOBUTIN is used at 300 mg/day as montherapy in MAC prophylaxis of HIV-infected persons, even with the concomitant use of fluconazole and/or macrolide antibacterials. However, if higher doses of MYCOBUTIN are administered in combination with these agents, the incidence of uveitis is higher. FDA proposes moving this paragraph from below with some revisions. Patients who developed uveitis had mild to severe symptoms that resolved after treatment with corticosteroids and/or mydriatic eye drops; in some severe cases, however, resolution of symptoms occurred after several weeks. When uveitis occurs, temporary discontinuance of MYCOBUTIN and ophthalmologic evaluation are recommended. In most mild cases, MYCOBUTIN may be restarted; however, if signs or symptoms recur, use of MYCOBUTIN should be discontinued (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, September 9, 1994). Corneal deposits have been reported during routine ophthalmologic surveillance of some HIV-positive pediatric patients receiving MYCOBUTIN as part of a multiple drug regimen for MAC prophylaxis. The deposits are tiny, almost transparent, asymptomatic peripheral and central corneal deposits, and do not impair vision. The following table enumerates the changes in laboratory values that were considered as laboratory abnormalities in Studies 023 and 027. Table 4 Percentage of Patients With Laboratory Abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities MYCOBUTIN (n = 566) % PLACEBO (n = 580) % Includes grades 3 or 4 toxicities as specified: Chemistry Increased alkaline phosphatase All values >450 U/L <1 3 Increased SGOT All values >150 U/L 7 12 Increased SGPT 9 11 Hematology Anemia All hemoglobin values <8.0 g/dL 6 7 Eosinophilia 1 1 Leukopenia All WBC values <1,500/mm 3 17 16 Neutropenia All ANC values <750/mm 3 25 20 Thrombocytopenia All platelet count values <50,000/mm 3 5 4 The incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with MYCOBUTIN was significantly greater than in patients treated with placebo (p = 0.03). Although thrombocytopenia was not significantly more common among patients treated with MYCOBUTIN in these trials, MYCOBUTIN has been clearly linked to thrombocytopenia in rare cases. One patient in Study 023 developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which was attributed to MYCOBUTIN. Adverse Reactions from Post-Marketing Experience Adverse reactions identified through post-marketing surveillance by system organ class (SOC) are listed below: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: White blood cell disorders (including agranulocytosis, lymphopenia, granulocytopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell count decreased, neutrophil count decreased), platelet count decreased. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity, bronchospasm, rash, and eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal disorders: Clostridium difficile colitis/ Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. Pyrexia, rash and other hypersensitivity reactions such as eosinophilia and bronchospasm might occur, as has been seen with other antibacterials. A limited number of skin discoloration have been reported. Rifamycin hypersensitivity reactions Hypersensitivity to rifamycins have been reported including flu-like symptoms, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema, conjunctivitis, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia."

Antiretrovirals Delavirdine: Coadministration of rifabutin and delavirdine is not recommended because rifabutin substantially decreases the plasma concentrations of delavirdine, and delavirdine increases the plasma concentrations of rifabutin (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY- Drug-Drug Interactions ). Indinavir: Coadministration of indinavir and rifabutin increases the plasma concentration of rifabutin. In patients receiving coadministration of indinavir, reduce the dosage of rifabutin by half (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY- Drug-Drug Interactions ). Nelfinavir: Coadministration of nelfinavir increases the plasma concentration of rifabutin. In patients receiving nelfinavir, reduce the dosage of rifabutin by half (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY- Drug-Drug Interactions ). Ritonavir: Coadministration of ritonavir is not recommended because it substantially increases the plasma concentration of rifabutin (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY- Drug-Drug Interactions ). High plasma concentrations of rifabutin may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including uveitis. Other Drugs Oral contraceptives: Rifabutin may decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives by inducing drug metabolism of ethinylestradiol and norethindrone. Women using oral contraceptives should be advised to change to or supplement with nonhormonal methods of birth control during treatment with rifabutin. Other drugs: The structurally similar drug, rifampin, is known to reduce the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs (see prescribing information for rifampin). Although rifabutin is a weaker enzyme inducer than rifampin, it may be expected to have some effect on those drugs as well."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Rifabutin Capsules were generally well tolerated in the controlled clinical trials. Discontinuation of therapy due to an adverse event was required in 16% of patients receiving rifabutin compared to 8% of patients receiving placebo in these trials. Primary reasons for discontinuation of rifabutin were rash (4% of treated patients), gastrointestinal intolerance (3%), and neutropenia (2%). The following table enumerates adverse experiences that occurred at a frequency of 1% or greater, among the patients treated with rifabutin in studies 023 and 027.

The following adverse events have occurred in more than one patient receiving rifabutin, but an etiologic role has not been established: seizure, paresthesia, aphasia, confusion, and non-specific T wave changes on electrocardiogram. When rifabutin was administered at doses from 1050 mg/day to 2400 mg/day, generalized arthralgia and uveitis were reported. These adverse experiences abated when rifabutin was discontinued. The following table enumerates the changes in laboratory values that were considered as laboratory abnormalities in studies 023 and 027. PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WITH LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES RIFABUTIN ( n = 566 ) % PLACEBO ( n = 580 ) % Chemistry: Increased Alkaline Phosphatase1 <1 3 Increased SGOT2 7 12 Increased SGPT2 9 11 Hematology: Anemia3 6 7 Eosinophilia 1 1 Leukopenia4 17 16 Neutropenia 5 25 20 Thrombocytopenia6 5 4 INCLUDES GRADE 3 OR 4 TOXICITIES AS SPECIFIED: 1 all values >450 U/L 2 all values >150 U/L 3 all hemoglobin values < 8 g/dL 4 all WBC values < 1,500/mm 5 all ANC values < 750/mm 6 all platelet count values < 50,000/mm The incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rifabutin was significantly greater than in patients treated with placebo (p = 0.03). Although thrombocytopenia was not significantly more common among patients treated with rifabutin in these trials, rifabutin has been clearly linked to thrombocytopenia in rare cases. One patient in study 023 developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which was attributed to rifabutin. Uveitis is rare when rifabutin is used as a single agent at 300 mg/day for prophylaxis of MAC in HIV-infected persons, even with the concomitant use of fluconazole and/or macrolide antibiotics. However, if higher doses of rifabutin are administered in combination with these agents, the incidence of uveitis is higher. Patients who developed uveitis had mild to severe symptoms that resolved after treatment with corticosteroids and/or mydriatic eye drops; in some severe cases, however, resolution of symptoms occurred after several weeks. When uveitis occurs, temporary discontinuance of rifabutin and ophthalmologic evaluation are recommended. In most mild cases, rifabutin may be restarted; however, if signs or symptoms recur, use of rifabutin should be discontinued (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, September 9, 1994).

        "Drug Interactions Multiple dosing of rifabutin has been associated with induction of hepatic metabolic enzymes of the CYP450 IIIA subfamily. Rifabutin's predominant metabolite (25-desacetyl rifabutin; LM 565), may also contribute to this effect. Metabolic induction due to rifabutin is likely to produce a decrease in circulating levels of concomitantly administered drugs (especially those metabolized by the CYP450 IIIA pathway). Kinetic data suggest that enzymatic induction by rifabutin is complete within 5 days and is dose-independent over the 300 to 600 mg dose-range. Similarly, concomitant medications that competitively inhibit the CYP450 IIIA activity may increase circulating levels of rifabutin. Malabsorption Gastric pH alteration due to progressing HIV disease has been linked with malabsorption of some drugs used in HIV-positive patients (e.g., rifampin, isoniazid). Drug serum concentration data from AIDS patients with varying disease severity (based on CD4+ counts) suggest that rifabutin absorption is not influenced by progressing HIV disease. Effects on Other Drugs Rifabutin induces CYP3A enzymes and therefore may reduce the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by those enzymes. This effect may reduce the efficacy of standard doses of such drugs, which include itraconazole, clarithromycin, and saquinavir (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Drug-Drug Interactions). Effects on Rifabutin Some drugs that inhibit CYP3A may significantly increase the plasma concentration of rifabutin. Because high plasma levels of rifabutin may increase the risk of adverse reactions, carefully monitor patients receiving coadministration of such drugs, which include fluconazole and clarithromycin (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Drug-Drug Interactions). In some cases, the dosage of MYCOBUTIN may need to be reduced when it is coadministered with such a drug (see below). The following table summarizes the results and magnitude of the pertinent drug interactions assessed with rifabutin. The clinical relevance of these interactions and subsequent dose modifications should be judged in light of the population studied, severity of the disease, patient's drug profile, and the likely impact on the risk/benefit ratio. Rifabutin Interaction StudiesND - No data AUC - Area under the Concentration vs. Time Curve Cmax - Maximum serum concentration Coadministered Drugs Effect on Rifabutin Effect on Coadministered Drug Comments ANTIVIRALS Amprenavir 2.9-fold ↑ AUC, 2.2-fold ↑ Cmax No significant change in kinetics. A 50% reduction in the rifabutin dose is recommended when combined with amprenavir. Increased monitoring for adverse reactions is warranted. Delavirdine ND Oral clearance ↑ 5-fold resulting in significantly lower mean trough plasma concentrations (18±15 to 1.0±0.7 µM) Study conducted in HIV-1 infected patients Rifabutin is not recommended for patients dosed with delavirdine mesylate 400 mg q8h. Didanosine No significant change in kinetics. No significant change in kinetics at steady state. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir 64% ↑ AUC - Drug plus active metabolite 35% ↑ AUC and 36% ↑ Cmax, no effect Ctrough (amprenavir) Dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least 75% (to 150 mg every other day or three times per week) is recommended when combined with fosamprenavir Indinavir 204% ↑ in AUC 32%↓ in AUC Lopinavir/ritonavir 5.7-fold ↑ AUC, 3.4 fold ↑ Cmax No significant change in lopinavir kinetics. Dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day is recommended (i.e., a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day or three times per week). Increased monitoring for adverse reactions is warranted. Further dosage reduction of rifabutin may be necessary. Saquinavir ND 40% ↓ in AUC Ritonavir 4 fold increase in AUC, 2.5 fold increase in Cmax ND In the presence of ritonavir the subsequent risk of side effects, including uveitis may be increased . If a protease inhibitor is required in a patient treated with rifabutin, agents other than ritonavir should be considered. Tipranavir/ritonavir[133] 2.9-fold ↑ AUC, 1.7-fold ↑ Cmax No significant change in tipranavir kinetics. Therapeutic drug monitoring of rifabutin is recommended. Zidovudine No significant change in kinetics. Approximately 32%↓ in Cmax and AUC A large controlled clinical study has shown that these changes are of no clinical relevance. ANTIFUNGALS ANTIFUNGALS 82% ↑ in AUC No significant change in steady-state plasma concentrations Itraconazole ND 70% to 75% ↓ in Cmax and AUC One case report suggests a kinetic interaction resulting in an increase in serum rifabutin levels and a risk for developing uveitis in the presence of itraconazole. Posaconazole 31%↑ Cmax, 72%↑ AUC 43%↓ Cmax, 49%↓ AUC If the drugs are co-administered, patients should be monitored for adverse events associated with rifabutin administration. Voriconazole 195%↑ Cmax, 331%↑ AUC - voriconazole dosed at 400 mg twice daily Rifabutin (300 mg once daily) decreased the Cmax and AUC of voriconazole at 200 mg twice daily by 69% and 78%, respectively. During co-administration with rifabutin, the Cmax and AUC of voriconazole at 350 mg twice daily were 96% and 68% of the levels when administered alone at 200 mg twice daily. At a voriconazole dose of 400 mg twice daily Cmax and AUC were 104% and 87% higher, respectively, compared with voriconazole alone at 200 mg twice daily. If the benefit outweighs the risk, rifabutin may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased to 5 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours or from 200 mg to 350 mg orally, every 12 hours (100 mg to 200 mg orally, every 12 hours in patients less than 40 kg). Careful monitoring of full blood counts and adverse events to rifabutin (e.g. uveitis) is recommended when rifabutin is coadministered with voriconazole ANTI-PCP (Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) Dapsone ND Approximately 27% to 40% ↓ in AUC Study conducted in HIV infected patients (rapid and slow acetylators). Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim No significant change in Cmax and AUC Approximately 15% to 20% ↓ in AUC In another study, only trimethoprim (not sulfamethoxazole) had 14% ↓ in AUC and 6%↓ in Cmax but were not considered clinically significant. ANTI-MAC (Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex) Azithromycin No PK interaction No PK interaction Clarithromycin Approximately 77% ↑ in AUC Approximately 50%↓ in AUC Study conducted in HIV infected patients. Dose of rifabutin should be adjusted in the presence of clarithromycin ANTI-TB (Tuberculosis) Ethambutol ND No significant change in AUC or Cmax Isoniazid ND Pharmacokinetics not affected Pyrazinamide ND ND Study data being evaluated. OTHER Methadone ND No significant effect No apparent effect of rifabutin on either peak levels of methadone or systemic exposure based upon AUC. Rifabutin kinetics not evaluated. Ethinylestradiol ND 35%↓ AUC 20%↓ Cmax Patients should be advised to use other methods of contraception. Norethindrone ND 46%↓ AUC Patients should be advised to use other methods of contraception. Tacrolimus ND ND Authors report that rifabutin decreases tacrolimus trough blood levels. Theophylline ND No significant change in AUC or Cmax compared with baseline. Other drugs The structurally similar drug, rifampin, is known to reduce the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs (see prescribing information for rifampin). Although rifabutin is a weaker enzyme inducer than rifampin, it may be expected to have some effect on those drugs as well."
