        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P‑450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p‑glycoprotein (P‑gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P‑gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P‑gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P‑gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations ( 7.4, 12.3 ). Exercise caution when administering with drugs that are inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/P-gp ( 7.4, 12.3 ). 7.1 Use with Cyclosporine Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P‑gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when co‑administered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that Rapamune be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED). If cyclosporine is withdrawn from combination therapy with Rapamune, higher doses of Rapamune are needed to maintain the recommended sirolimus trough concentration ranges [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Grapefruit Juice Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with or be used for dilution of Rapamune [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The dosage of Rapamune and/or the co-administered drug may need to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Drugs that could increase sirolimus blood concentrations: Bromocriptione, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, HIV‑protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil Drugs and other agents that could decrease sirolimus concentrations: Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) Drugs with concentrations that could increase when given with Rapamune: Verapamil 7.5 Vaccination Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with Rapamune, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. Increased susceptibility to infection, lymphoma, and malignancy [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis in liver transplant patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Bronchial anastomotic dehiscence in lung transplant patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Decline in renal function in long-term combination of cyclosporine with Rapamune [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Interstitial lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Increased risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. The most common (≥ 30%) adverse reactions observed with Rapamune in clinical studies are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia. The following adverse reactions resulted in a rate of discontinuation of > 5% in clinical trials: creatinine increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The most common (> 30%) adverse reactions are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-934-5556 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience in Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection Following Renal Transplantation The safety and efficacy of Rapamune Oral Solution for the prevention of organ rejection following renal transplantation were assessed in two randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The safety profiles in the two studies were similar. The incidence of adverse reactions in the randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2) in which 219 renal transplant patients received Rapamune Oral Solution 2 mg/day, 208 received Rapamune Oral Solution 5 mg/day, and 124 received placebo is presented in the table below. The study population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 71 years), the distribution was 67% male, and the composition by race was: White (78%), Black (11%), Asian (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Other (5%). All patients were treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Data (≥ 12 months post-transplant) presented in the following table show the adverse reactions that occurred in at least one of the Rapamune treatment groups with an incidence of ≥ 20%. The safety profile of the tablet did not differ from that of the oral solution formulation [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In general, adverse reactions related to the administration of Rapamune were dependent on dose/concentration. Although a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg, with a loading dose of 15 mg, was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage over the 2 mg dose could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 mg of Rapamune Oral Solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 5 mg of Rapamune Oral Solution per day. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. ADVERSE REACTIONS OCCURRING AT A FREQUENCY OF ≥ 20% IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE RAPAMUNE TREATMENT GROUPS IN A STUDY OF PROPHYLAXIS OF ORGAN REJECTION FOLLOWING RENAL TRANSPLANTATION (%) AT ≥ 12 MONTHS POST-TRANSPLANTATION (STUDY 2)a –––Rapamune Oral Solution––– 2 mg/day 5 mg/day Placebo Adverse Reaction (n = 218) (n = 208) (n = 124) a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Cardiovascular – Venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis), tachycardia. Digestive System – Stomatitis. Hematologic and Lymphatic System – Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), leukopenia. Metabolic/Nutritional – Abnormal healing, increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), hypokalemia. Musculoskeletal System – Bone necrosis. Respiratory System – Pneumonia, epistaxis. Skin – Melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma. Urogenital System – Pyelonephritis, decline in renal function (creatinine increased) in long-term combination of cyclosporine with Rapamune [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Less frequently (< 3%) occurring adverse reactions included: lymphoma/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, mycobacterial infections (including M. tuberculosis), pancreatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Increased Serum Cholesterol and Triglycerides The use of Rapamune in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment. In Studies 1 and 2, in de novo renal transplant patients who began the study with fasting, total serum cholesterol< 200 mg/dL or fasting, total serum triglycerides < 200 mg/dL, there was an increased incidence of hypercholesterolemia (fasting serum cholesterol > 240 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (fasting serum triglycerides > 500 mg/dL), respectively, in patients receiving both Rapamune 2 mg and Rapamune 5 mg compared with azathioprine and placebo controls. Treatment of new-onset hypercholesterolemia with lipid-lowering agents was required in 42‑52% of patients enrolled in the Rapamune arms of Studies 1 and 2 compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 22% of patients in the azathioprine arm. Abnormal Healing Abnormal healing events following transplant surgery include fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and anastomosis disruption (e.g., wound, vascular, airway, ureteral, biliary). Malignancies The table below summarizes the incidence of malignancies in the two controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) for the prevention of acute rejection [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. At 24 months (Study 1) and 36 months (Study 2), there were no significant differences among treatment groups. INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 1 (24 MONTHS) AND STUDY 2 (36 MONTHS) POST-TRANSPLANTa,b Malignancy Rapamune Oral Solution 2 mg/day Rapamune Oral Solution 5 mg/day Azathioprine 2-3 mg/kg/day Placebo Study 1 (n = 284) Study 2 (n = 227) Study 1 (n = 274) Study 2 (n = 219) Study 1 (n = 161) Study 2 (n = 130) a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. c: Patients may be counted in more than one category.

All patients were treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile prior to randomization (start of cyclosporine withdrawal) was similar to that of the 2 mg Rapamune groups in Studies 1 and 2. Following randomization (at 3 months), patients who had cyclosporine eliminated from their therapy experienced higher incidences of the following adverse reactions: abnormal liver function tests (including increased AST/SGOT and increased ALT/SGPT), hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal healing. Conversely, the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in patients who remained on cyclosporine than those who had cyclosporine withdrawn from therapy: hypertension, cyclosporine toxicity, increased creatinine, abnormal kidney function, toxic nephropathy, edema, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and gum hyperplasia. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved significantly following cyclosporine withdrawal. Malignancies The incidence of malignancies in Study 3 [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] is presented in the table following. In Study 3, the incidence of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease was similar in all treatment groups. The overall incidence of malignancy was higher in patients receiving Rapamune plus cyclosporine compared with patients who had cyclosporine withdrawn. Conclusions regarding these differences in the incidence of malignancy could not be made because Study 3 was not designed to consider malignancy risk factors or systematically screen subjects for malignancy. In addition, more patients in the Rapamune with cyclosporine group had a pretransplantation history of skin carcinoma. INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 3 (CYCLOSPORINE WITHDRAWAL STUDY) AT 36 MONTHS POST-TRANSPLANTa,b Malignancy Nonrandomized (n = 95) Rapamune with Cyclosporine Therapy (n = 215) Rapamune Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal (n = 215) a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. c: Patients may be counted in more than one category.

Overall, the incidence and nature of adverse events was similar to those seen in previous combination studies with Rapamune. The incidence of malignancy was 1.3% at 12 months. 6.4 Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitors to Rapamune in Maintenance Renal Transplant Population The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant population have not been established [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. In an ongoing study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune (initial target sirolimus concentrations of 12-20 ng/mL, and then 8-20 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients (n = 87) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min. There was a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death, in this stratum of the Rapamune treatment arm. The subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min had 2 years of follow-up after randomization. In this population, the rate of pneumonia was 15/58 vs. 4/29, graft loss (excluding death with functioning graft loss) was 13/58 vs. 9/29, and death was 9/58 vs. 1/29 in the sirolimus conversion group and CNI continuation group, respectively. In the subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of greater than 40 mL/min, there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the Rapamune conversion arm. Overall in this study, a 5-fold increase in the reports of tuberculosis among sirolimus (11/551) and comparator (1/273) treatment groups was observed with 2:1 randomization scheme. 6.5 Pediatrics Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (< 18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections. 6.6 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Rapamune. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole – Lymphedema. Cardiovascular – Pericardial effusion (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults). Hematological/Lymphatic – The concomitant use of Rapamune with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]; pancytopenia, neutropenia. Hepatobiliary Disorders – Hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic necrosis, with elevated sirolimus trough concentrations. Immune System – Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Infections – Tuberculosis. Metabolic/Nutritional – Liver function test abnormal, AST/SGOT increased, ALT/SGPT increased, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia. Respiratory – Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune. The risk may be increased as the sirolimus trough concentration increases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]; pulmonary hemorrhage; pleural effusion; alveolar proteinosis Skin – Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Urogenital – Nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Azoospermia has been reported with the use of Rapamune and has been reversible upon discontinuation of Rapamune in most cases."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions ( 5.4 ) Angioedema ( 5.5 ) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing ( 5.6 ) Hyperlipidemia ( 5.7 ) Renal Function ( 5.8 ) Proteinuria ( 5.9 ) Interstitial Lung Disease ( 5.10 ) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine ( 5.11 ) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7-3.2% (for Rapamune-treated patients) versus 0.6-0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2)]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increasesusceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use Rapamune. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation – Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The use of Rapamune in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss in a study in de novo liver transplant patients (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of Rapamune in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.3 Lung Transplantation – Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when Rapamune has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of Rapamune [see Adverse Reactions (6.6)]. 5.5 Angioedema Rapamune has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of Rapamune with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with Rapamune [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving Rapamune. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with Rapamune compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43-46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45-57%) in patients receiving Rapamune compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including Rapamune. Any patient who is administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials, the concomitant administration of Rapamune and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and/or fibrates appeared to be well-tolerated. During Rapamune therapy with cyclosporine, patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the co-administration of Rapamune with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and Rapamune were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving Rapamune and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of Rapamune and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, Rapamune may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients 6-120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to Rapamune compared with CNI continuation [see Clinical Studies (14.4), Adverse Reactions (6.4)]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to Rapamune conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion.New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the Rapamune conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the Rapamune conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of Rapamune. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see Adverse Reactions (6.6)]. 5.11 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.12 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of Rapamune with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Adverse Reactions (6.6)]. 5.13 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.14 Assay for Sirolimus Therapeutic Drug Monitoring The label-recommended 24-hour trough concentration ranges for sirolimus are based on chromatographic methods. Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by both chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. These concentration values are not interchangeable [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.16 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Co-administration of Rapamune with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations (7.4, 12.3). Exercise caution when administering with drugs that are inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/P-gp (7.4, 12.3). 7.1 Use with Cyclosporine Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when co-administered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that sirolimus be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED). If cyclosporine is withdrawn from combination therapy with sirolimus, higher doses of sirolimus are needed to maintain the recommended sirolimus trough concentration ranges [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with sirolimus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P - gp Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The dosage of sirolimus and/or the co-administered drug may need to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs that could increase sirolimus blood concentrations:Bromocriptione, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, protease inhibitors (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C that include drugs such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil Drugs and other agents that could decrease sirolimus concentrations:Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) Drugs with concentrations that could increase when given with sirolimus:Verapamil 7.5 Vaccination Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with sirolimus, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. Increased susceptibility to infection, lymphoma, and malignancy [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis in liver transplant patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Bronchial anastomotic dehiscence in lung transplant patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Decline in renal function in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Interstitial lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Increased risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ]. The most common (≥ 30%) adverse reactions observed with sirolimus in clinical studies are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia. The following adverse reactions resulted in a rate of discontinuation of > 5% in clinical trials: creatinine increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The most common (> 30%) adverse reactions are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia (6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience in Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection Following Renal Transplantation The safety and efficacy of sirolimus oral solution for the prevention of organ rejection following renal transplantation were assessed in two randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The safety profiles in the two studies were similar. The incidence of adverse reactions in the randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo- controlled trial (Study 2) in which 219 renal transplant patients received sirolimus oral solution 2 mg/day, 208 received sirolimus oral solution 5 mg/day, and 124 received placebo is presented in the table below. The study population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 71 years), the distribution was 67% male, and the composition by race was: White (78%), Black (11%), Asian (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Other (5%). All patients were treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Data (≥ 12 months post-transplant) presented in the following table show the adverse reactions that occurred in at least one of the sirolimus treatment groups with an incidence of ≥ 20%. The safety profile of the tablet did not differ from that of the oral solution formulation [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In general, adverse reactions related to the administration of sirolimus were dependent on dose/concentration. Although a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg, with a loading dose of 15 mg, was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage over the 2 mg dose could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 5 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. ADVERSE REACTIONS OCCURRING AT A FREQUENCY OF ≥ 20% IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE SIROLIMUS TREATMENT GROUPS IN A STUDY OF PROPHYLAXIS OF ORGAN REJECTION FOLLOWING RENAL TRANSPLANTATION (%) AT ≥ 12 MONTHS POST­-TRANSPLANTATION (STUDY 2)a –––Sirolimus Oral Solution––– 2 mg/day 5 mg/day Placebo Adverse Reaction (n = 218) (n = 208) (n = 124) a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids.

Cardiovascular— Venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis), tachycardia. Digestive System— Stomatitis. Hematologic and Lymphatic System— Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), leukopenia. Metabolic/Nutritional— Abnormal healing, increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), hypokalemia. Musculoskeletal System— Bone necrosis. Respiratory System— Pneumonia, epistaxis. Skin— Melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma. Urogenital System— Pyelonephritis, decline in renal function (creatinine increased) in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ], ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Less frequently (< 3%) occurring adverse reactions included: lymphoma/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, mycobacterial infections (including M. tuberculosis), pancreatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Increased Serum Cholesterol and Triglycerides The use of sirolimus in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment. In Studies 1 and 2, in de novo renal transplant patients who began the study with fasting, total serum cholesterol < 200 mg/dL or fasting, total serum triglycerides < 200 mg/dL, there was an increased incidence of hypercholesterolemia (fasting serum cholesterol > 240 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (fasting serum triglycerides > 500 mg/dL), respectively, in patients receiving both sirolimus 2 mg and sirolimus 5 mg compared with azathioprine and placebo controls. Treatment of new-onset hypercholesterolemia with lipid-lowering agents was required in 42 to 52% of patients enrolled in the sirolimus arms of Studies 1 and 2 compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 22% of patients in the azathioprine arm. In other sirolimus renal transplant studies, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Abnormal Healing Abnormal healing events following transplant surgery include fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and anastomosis disruption (e.g., wound, vascular, airway, ureteral, biliary). Malignancies The table below summarizes the incidence of malignancies in the two controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) for the prevention of acute rejection [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. At 24 months (Study 1) and 36 months (Study 2), there were no significant differences among treatment groups. INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 1 (24 MONTHS) AND STUDY 2 (36 MONTHS) POST-TRANSPLANTa,b Sirolimus Oral Solution 2 mg/day Sirolimus Oral Solution 5 mg/day Azathioprine 2 to 3 mg/kg/day Placebo Malignancy Study 1 (n = 284) Study 2 (n =227) Study 1 (n = 274) Study 2 (n = 219) Study 1 (n = 161) Study 2 (n = 130) Lymphoma/ lymphoproliferative disease 0.7 1.8 1.1 3.2 0.6 0.8 Skin Carcinoma Any Squamous Cellc 0.4 2.7 2.2 0.9 3.8 3.0 Any Basal Cellc 0.7 2.2 1.5 1.8 2.5 5.3 Melanoma 0.0 0.4 0.0 1.4 0.0 0.0 Miscellaneous/Not Specified 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.8 Total 1.1 4.4 3.3 4.1 4.3 7.7 Other Malignancy 1.1 2.2 1.5 1.4 0.6 2.3 a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. c: Patients may be counted in more than one category. 6.2 Sirolimus Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal The incidence of adverse reactions was determined through 36 months in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial (Study 3) in which 215 renal transplant patients received sirolimus as a maintenance regimen following cyclosporine withdrawal, and 215 patients received sirolimus with cyclosporine therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. All patients were treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile prior to randomization (start of cyclosporine withdrawal) was similar to that of the 2 mg sirolimus groups in Studies 1 and 2. Following randomization (at 3 months), patients who had cyclosporine eliminated from their therapy experienced higher incidences of the following adverse reactions: abnormal liver function tests (including increased AST/SGOT and increased ALT/SGPT), hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal healing. Conversely, the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in patients who remained on cyclosporine than those who had cyclosporine withdrawn from therapy: hypertension, cyclosporine toxicity, increased creatinine, abnormal kidney function, toxic nephropathy, edema, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and gum hyperplasia. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved significantly following cyclosporine withdrawal. Malignancies The incidence of malignancies in Study 3 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] is presented in the table following. In Study 3, the incidence of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease was similar in all treatment groups. The overall incidence of malignancy was higher in patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine compared with patients who had cyclosporine withdrawn. Conclusions regarding these differences in the incidence of malignancy could not be made because Study 3 was not designed to consider malignancy risk factors or systematically screen subjects for malignancy. In addition, more patients in the sirolimus with cyclosporine group had a pretransplantation history of skin carcinoma. INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 3 (CYCLOSPORINE WITHDRAWAL STUDY) AT 36 MONTHS POST-TRANSPLANTa,b Nonrandomized (n = 95) Sirolimus with CyclosporineTherapy (n = 215) Sirolimus Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal (n = 215) Lymphoma/ lymphoproliferative disease 1.1 1.4 0.5 Skin Carcinoma Any Squamous Cellc 3.2 3.3 2.3 Any Basal Cellc 3.2 6.5 2.3 Melanoma 0.0 0.5 0.0 Miscellaneous/Not Specified 1.1 0.9 0.0 Total 4.2 7.9 3.7 Other Malignancy 3.2 3.3 1.9 a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. c: Patients may be counted in more than one category. 6.3 High-Immunologic Risk Patients Safety was assessed in 224 patients who received at least one dose of sirolimus with cyclosporine [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Overall, the incidence and nature of adverse events was similar to those seen in previous combination studies with sirolimus. The incidence of malignancy was 1.3% at 12 months. 6.4 Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitors to Sirolimus in Maintenance Renal Transplant Population The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant population have not been established [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. In a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus (initial target sirolimus concentrations of 12 to 20 ng/mL, and then 8 to 20 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients (n = 87) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min. There was a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death, in this stratum of the sirolimus treatment arm. The subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min had 2 years of follow-up after randomization. In this population, the rate of pneumonia was 15/58 vs.4/29, graft loss (excluding death with functioning graft loss) was 13/58 vs. 9/29, and death was 9/58 vs. 1/29 in the sirolimus conversion group and CNI continuation group, respectively. In the subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of greater than 40 mL/min, there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the sirolimus conversion arm. Overall in this study, a 5-fold increase in the reports of tuberculosis among sirolimus (11/551) and comparator (1/273) treatment groups was observed with 2:1 randomization scheme. 6.5 Pediatrics Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (< 18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. The use of sirolimus in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections. 6.6 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sirolimus. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole— Lymphedema. Cardiovascular— Pericardial effusion (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults) and accumulation. Digestive System : Ascites Hematological/Lymphatic— The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ) ]; pancytopenia, neutropenia. Hepatobiliary Disorders— Hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic necrosis, with elevated sirolimus trough concentrations. Immune System— Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Infections— Tuberculosis. BK virus associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ]. Colstridium difficile enterocolitis. Metabolic/Nutritional— Liver function test abnormal, AST/SGOT increased, ALT/SGPT increased, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia. Respiratory— Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the sirolimus trough concentration increases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) ]; pulmonary hemorrhage; pleural effusion; alveolar proteinosis. Skin— Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Urogenital— Nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Azoospermia has been reported with the use of sirolimus and has been reversible upon discontinuation of sirolimus in most cases."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions (5.4) Angioedema (5.5) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing (5.6) Hyperlipidemia (5.7) Renal Function (5.8) Proteinuria (5.9) Latent Viral Infections (5.10) Interstitial Lung Disease (5.11) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine (5.12) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (5.13) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7 to 3.2% (for sirolimus-treated patients) versus 0.6 to 0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2) ]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use sirolimus. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation - Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of sirolimus has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT). In a study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post- transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6 to 144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI- based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. 5.3 Lung Transplantation — Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of sirolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. 5.5 Angioedema Sirolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of sirolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving sirolimus, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with sirolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving sirolimus. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with sirolimus compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43 to ­46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45 to 57%) in patients receiving sirolimus compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including sirolimus. Any patient who is administered sirolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine or sirolimus after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse events such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (<1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of sirolimus on cardiovascular mortality. During sirolimus therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the co-administration of sirolimus with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and sirolimus were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving sirolimus and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of sirolimus and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients 6 to 120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to sirolimus compared with CNI continuation [see Clinical Studies (14.4), Adverse Reactions (6.4) ]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Assay for Sirolimus Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Co-administration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P‑450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p‑glycoprotein (P‑gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P‑gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P‑gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P‑gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations (7.4, 12.3). Exercise caution when administering with drugs that are inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/P-gp (7.4, 12.3). 7.1 Use with Cyclosporine Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P‑gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when co‑administered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that Rapamune be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED). If cyclosporine is withdrawn from combination therapy with Rapamune, higher doses of Rapamune are needed to maintain the recommended sirolimus trough concentration ranges [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Grapefruit Juice Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with or be used for dilution of Rapamune [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The dosage of Rapamune and/or the co-administered drug may need to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Drugs that could increase sirolimus blood concentrations: Bromocriptione, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, protease inhibitors (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C that include drugs such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil Drugs and other agents that could decrease sirolimus concentrations: Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) Drugs with concentrations that could increase when given with Rapamune: Verapamil 7.5 Vaccination Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with Rapamune, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. Increased susceptibility to infection, lymphoma, and malignancy [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis in liver transplant patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Bronchial anastomotic dehiscence in lung transplant patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6)] Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Decline in renal function in long-term combination of cyclosporine with Rapamune [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Interstitial lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] Increased risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]. The most common (≥ 30%) adverse reactions observed with Rapamune in clinical studies for organ rejection prophylaxis in recipients of renal transplantation are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia. The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions observed with Rapamune in the clinical study for the treatment of LAM are: stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, acne, chest pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and hypercholesterolemia. The following adverse reactions resulted in a rate of discontinuation of > 5% in clinical trials for renal transplant rejection prophylaxis: creatinine increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). In patients with LAM, 11% of subjects discontinued due to adverse reactions, with no single adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in more than one patient being treated with Rapamune. Prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 30%) are peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia (6). Lymphangioleiomyomatosis: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) are stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, acne, chest pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and hypercholesterolemia.

The safety profiles in the two studies were similar. The incidence of adverse reactions in the randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2) in which 219 renal transplant patients received Rapamune Oral Solution 2 mg/day, 208 received Rapamune Oral Solution 5 mg/day, and 124 received placebo is presented in the table below. The study population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 71 years), the distribution was 67% male, and the composition by race was: White (78%), Black (11%), Asian (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Other (5%). All patients were treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Data (≥ 12 months post-transplant) presented in the following table show the adverse reactions that occurred in at least one of the Rapamune treatment groups with an incidence of ≥ 20%. The safety profile of the tablet did not differ from that of the oral solution formulation [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. In general, adverse reactions related to the administration of Rapamune were dependent on dose/concentration. Although a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg, with a loading dose of 15 mg, was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage over the 2 mg dose could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 mg of Rapamune Oral Solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 5 mg of Rapamune Oral Solution per day. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Cardiovascular – Venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis), tachycardia. Digestive System – Stomatitis. Hematologic and Lymphatic System – Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), leukopenia. Metabolic/Nutritional – Abnormal healing, increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), hypokalemia, diabetes mellitus. Musculoskeletal System – Bone necrosis. Respiratory System – Pneumonia, epistaxis. Skin – Melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma. Urogenital System – Pyelonephritis, decline in renal function (creatinine increased) in long-term combination of cyclosporine with Rapamune [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )], ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Less frequently (< 3%) occurring adverse reactions included: lymphoma/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, mycobacterial infections (including M. tuberculosis), pancreatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Increased Serum Cholesterol and Triglycerides The use of Rapamune in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment. In Studies 1 and 2, in de novo renal transplant patients who began the study with fasting, total serum cholesterol < 200 mg/dL or fasting, total serum triglycerides < 200 mg/dL, there was an increased incidence of hypercholesterolemia (fasting serum cholesterol > 240 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (fasting serum triglycerides > 500 mg/dL), respectively, in patients receiving both Rapamune 2 mg and Rapamune 5 mg compared with azathioprine and placebo controls. Treatment of new-onset hypercholesterolemia with lipid-lowering agents was required in 42‑52% of patients enrolled in the Rapamune arms of Studies 1 and 2 compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 22% of patients in the azathioprine arm. In other Rapamune renal transplant studies, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Abnormal Healing Abnormal healing events following transplant surgery include fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and anastomosis disruption (e.g., wound, vascular, airway, ureteral, biliary). Malignancies The table below summarizes the incidence of malignancies in the two controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) for the prevention of acute rejection [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. At 24 months (Study 1) and 36 months (Study 2), there were no significant differences among treatment groups. TABLE 2: INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 1 (24 MONTHS) AND STUDY 2 (36 MONTHS) POST-TRANSPLANTa,b a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids.b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. c: Patients may be counted in more than one category. Malignancy Rapamune Oral Solution 2 mg/day Rapamune Oral Solution 5 mg/day Azathioprine 2-3 mg/kg/day Placebo Study 1 (n = 284) Study 2 (n = 227) Study 1 (n = 274) Study 2 (n = 219) Study 1 (n = 161) Study 2 (n = 130) Lymphoma/ lymphoproliferative disease 0.7 1.8 1.1 3.2 0.6 0. 8 Skin Carcinoma Any Squamous Cellc 0.4 2.7 2.2 0.9 3.8 3.0 Any Basal Cellc 0.7 2.2 1.5 1.8 2.5 5.3 Melanoma 0.0 0.4 0.0 1.4 0.0 0.0 Miscellaneous/Not Specified 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.8 Total 1.1 4.4 3.3 4.1 4.3 7.7 Other Malignancy 1.1 2.2 1.5 1.4 0.6 2.3 6.2 Rapamune Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal The incidence of adverse reactions was determined through 36 months in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial (Study 3) in which 215 renal transplant patients received Rapamune as a maintenance regimen following cyclosporine withdrawal, and 215 patients received Rapamune with cyclosporine therapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. All patients were treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile prior to randomization (start of cyclosporine withdrawal) was similar to that of the 2 mg Rapamune groups in Studies 1 and 2. Following randomization (at 3 months), patients who had cyclosporine eliminated from their therapy experienced higher incidences of the following adverse reactions: abnormal liver function tests (including increased AST/SGOT and increased ALT/SGPT), hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal healing. Conversely, the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in patients who remained on cyclosporine than those who had cyclosporine withdrawn from therapy: hypertension, cyclosporine toxicity, increased creatinine, abnormal kidney function, toxic nephropathy, edema, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and gum hyperplasia. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved significantly following cyclosporine withdrawal. Malignancies The incidence of malignancies in Study 3 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] is presented in the table following. In Study 3, the incidence of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease was similar in all treatment groups. The overall incidence of malignancy was higher in patients receiving Rapamune plus cyclosporine compared with patients who had cyclosporine withdrawn. Conclusions regarding these differences in the incidence of malignancy could not be made because Study 3 was not designed to consider malignancy risk factors or systematically screen subjects for malignancy. In addition, more patients in the Rapamune with cyclosporine group had a pretransplantation history of skin carcinoma. TABLE 3: INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 3 (CYCLOSPORINE WITHDRAWAL STUDY) AT 36 MONTHS POST-TRANSPLANTa,b a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids.b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. c: Patients may be counted in more than one category. Malignancy Nonrandomized (n = 95) Rapamune with Cyclosporine Therapy (n = 215) Rapamune Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal (n = 215) Lymphoma/ lymphoproliferative disease 1.1 1.4 0.5 Skin Carcinoma Any Squamous Cellc 3.2 3.3 2.3 Any Basal Cellc 3.2 6.5 2.3 Melanoma 0.0 0.5 0.0 Miscellaneous/Not Specified 1.1 0.9 0.0 Total 4.2 7.9 3.7 Other Malignancy 3.2 3.3 1.9 6.3 High-Immunologic Risk Renal Transplant Patients Safety was assessed in 224 patients who received at least one dose of sirolimus with cyclosporine [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]. Overall, the incidence and nature of adverse events was similar to those seen in previous combination studies with Rapamune. The incidence of malignancy was 1.3% at 12 months. 6.4 Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitors to Rapamune in Maintenance Renal Transplant Population The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant population have not been established [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )]. In a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune (initial target sirolimus concentrations of 12-20 ng/mL, and then 8-20 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients (n = 87) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min. There was a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death, in this stratum of the Rapamune treatment arm. The subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min had 2 years of follow-up after randomization. In this population, the rate of pneumonia was 15/58 vs. 4/29, graft loss (excluding death with functioning graft loss) was 13/58 vs. 9/29, and death was 9/58 vs. 1/29 in the sirolimus conversion group and CNI continuation group, respectively. In the subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of greater than 40 mL/min, there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the Rapamune conversion arm. Overall in this study, a 5-fold increase in the reports of tuberculosis among sirolimus (11/551) and comparator (1/273) treatment groups was observed with 2:1 randomization scheme. 6.5 Pediatric Renal Transplant Patients Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (< 18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )]. The use of Rapamune in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections. 6.6 Patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Safety was assessed in a controlled trial involving 89 patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, 46 of whom were treated with Rapamune [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ]. The adverse drug reactions observed in this trial were consistent with the known safety profile for renal transplant patients receiving Rapamune, with the addition of weight decreased which was reported at a greater incidence with Rapamune when compared to placebo. Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of ≥ 20% in the Rapamune treatment group and greater than placebo include stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, acne, chest pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and hypercholesterolemia. 6.7 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Rapamune in transplant patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole – Lymphedema. Cardiovascular – Pericardial effusion (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults) and fluid accumulation. Digestive System – Ascites. Hematological/Lymphatic – The concomitant use of Rapamune with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]; pancytopenia, neutropenia. Hepatobiliary Disorders – Hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic necrosis, with elevated sirolimus trough concentrations. Immune System – Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Infections – Tuberculosis. BK virus associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Rapamune. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including Rapamune [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )]. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis. Metabolic/Nutritional – Liver function test abnormal, AST/SGOT increased, ALT/SGPT increased, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus. Nervous system - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Respiratory – Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune. The risk may be increased as the sirolimus trough concentration increases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]; pulmonary hemorrhage; pleural effusion; alveolar proteinosis. Skin – Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Urogenital – Nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Azoospermia has been reported with the use of Rapamune and has been reversible upon discontinuation of Rapamune in most cases."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions (5.4) Angioedema (5.5) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing (5.6) Hyperlipidemia (5.7) Renal Function (5.8) Proteinuria (5.9) Latent Viral Infections (5.10) Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis (5.11) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine (5.12) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (5.13) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7-3.2% (for Rapamune-treated patients) versus 0.6-0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and ( 6.2 )]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use Rapamune for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation – Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of Rapamune has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT). In a study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of Rapamune in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of Rapamune in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6-144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a Rapamune-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI-based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )]. 5.3 Lung Transplantation – Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when Rapamune has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of Rapamune as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of Rapamune [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.7 )]. 5.5 Angioedema Rapamune has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of Rapamune with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving Rapamune, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with Rapamune [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving Rapamune. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with Rapamune compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43–46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45-57%) in patients receiving Rapamune compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including Rapamune. Any patient who is administered Rapamune should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving Rapamune plus cyclosporine or Rapamune after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of Rapamune and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse events such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (<1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of Rapamune on cardiovascular mortality. During Rapamune therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the co-administration of Rapamune with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and Rapamune were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving Rapamune and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of Rapamune and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, Rapamune may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients 6-120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to Rapamune compared with CNI continuation [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.4)]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to Rapamune conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the Rapamune conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the Rapamune conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of Rapamune. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Rapamune in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Rapamune. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.7 )]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including Rapamune. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis Cases of interstitial lung disease [ILD] (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including Rapamune. In some cases, the ILD was reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]) as a secondary event. In some cases, the ILD has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of Rapamune. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.7 )]. 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with Rapamune, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of Rapamune without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of Rapamune with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.7 )]. 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in transplant patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Different Sirolimus Trough Concentration Reported between Chromatographic and Immunoassay Methodologies Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Co-administration of Rapamune with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations (7.4, 12.3). Exercise caution when administering with drugs that are inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/P-gp (7.4, 12.3). 7.1 Use with Cyclosporine Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when co-administered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that sirolimus be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED). If cyclosporine is withdrawn from combination therapy with sirolimus, higher doses of sirolimus are needed to maintain the recommended sirolimus trough concentration ranges [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Grapefruit Juice Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with or be used for dilution of sirolimus [see Dosage and Administration (2.9), Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The dosage of sirolimus and/or the co-administered drug may need to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drugs that could increase sirolimus blood concentrations: Bromocriptione, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, protease inhibitors (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C that include drugs such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil Drugs and other agents that could decrease sirolimus concentrations: Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) Drugs with concentrations that could increase when given with sirolimus: Verapamil 7.5 Vaccination Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with sirolimus, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. Increased susceptibility to infection, lymphoma, and malignancy [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis in liver transplant patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Bronchial anastomotic dehiscence in lung transplant patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Decline in renal function in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Interstitial lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Increased risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ]. The most common (≥ 30%) adverse reactions observed with sirolimus in clinical studies for organ rejection prophylaxis in recipients of renal transplantation are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia. The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions observed with sirolimus in the clinical study for the treatment of LAM are: stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, acne, chest pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and hypercholesterolemia. The following adverse reactions resulted in a rate of discontinuation of >5% in clinical trials for renal transplant rejection prophylaxis: creatinine increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). In patients with LAM, 11% of subjects discontinued due to adverse reactions, with no single adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in more than one patient being treated with sirolimus. Prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 30%) are peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia (6). Lymphangioleiomyomatosis: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) are stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, acne, chest pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and hypercholesterolemia.

The safety profiles in the two studies were similar. The incidence of adverse reactions in the randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2) in which 219 renal transplant patients received sirolimus oral solution 2 mg/day, 208 received sirolimus oral solution 5 mg/day, and 124 received placebo is presented in the table below. The study population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 71 years), the distribution was 67% male, and the composition by race was: White (78%), Black (11%), Asian (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Other (5%). All patients were treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Data (≥ 12 months post-transplant) presented in the following table show the adverse reactions that occurred in at least one of the sirolimus treatment groups with an incidence of ≥ 20%. The safety profile of the tablet did not differ from that of the oral solution formulation [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In general, adverse reactions related to the administration of sirolimus were dependent on dose/concentration. Although a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg, with a loading dose of 15 mg, was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage over the 2 mg dose could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 5 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. TABLE 1: ADVERSE REACTIONS OCCURRING AT A FREQUENCY OF ≥ 20% IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE SIROLIMUS TREATMENT GROUPS IN A STUDY OF PROPHYLAXIS OF ORGAN REJECTION FOLLOWING RENAL TRANSPLANTATION (%) AT ≥ 12 MONTHS POST-TRANSPLANTATION (STUDY 2)Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. ––– Sirolimus Oral Solution––– 2 mg/day 5 mg/day Placebo Adverse Reaction (n = 218) (n = 208) (n = 124) Peripheral edema 54 58 48 Hypertriglyceridemia 45 57 23 Hypertension 45 49 48 Hypercholesterolemia 43 46 23 Creatinine increased 39 40 38 Constipation 36 38 31 Abdominal pain 29 36 30 Diarrhea 25 35 27 Headache 34 34 31 Fever 23 34 35 Urinary tract infection 26 33 26 Anemia 23 33 21 Nausea 25 31 29 Arthralgia 25 31 18 Thrombocytopenia 14 30 9 Pain 33 29 25 Acne 22 22 19 Rash 10 20 6 Edema 20 18 15 The following adverse reactions were reported less frequently (≥ 3%, but <20%) Body as a Whole – Sepsis, lymphocele, herpes zoster, herpes simplex. Cardiovascular – Venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis), tachycardia. Digestive System – Stomatitis. Hematologic and Lymphatic System – Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), leukopenia. Metabolic/Nutritional – Abnormal healing, increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), hypokalemia, diabetes mellitus. Musculoskeletal System – Bone necrosis. Respiratory System – Pneumonia, epistaxis. Skin – Melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma. Urogenital System – Pyelonephritis, decline in renal function (creatinine increased) in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ], ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Less frequently (<3%) occurring adverse reactions included: lymphoma/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, mycobacterial infections (including M. tuberculosis), pancreatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Increased Serum Cholesterol and Triglycerides The use of sirolimus in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment. In Studies 1 and 2, in de novo renal transplant patients who began the study with fasting, total serum cholesterol <200 mg/dL or fasting, total serum triglycerides <200 mg/dL, there was an increased incidence of hypercholesterolemia (fasting serum cholesterol >240 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (fasting serum triglycerides >500 mg/dL), respectively, in patients receiving both sirolimus 2 mg and sirolimus 5 mg compared with azathioprine and placebo controls. Treatment of new-onset hypercholesterolemia with lipid-lowering agents was required in 42–52% of patients enrolled in the sirolimus arms of Studies 1 and 2 compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 22% of patients in the azathioprine arm. In other sirolimus renal transplant studies, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Abnormal Healing Abnormal healing events following transplant surgery include fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and anastomosis disruption (e.g., wound, vascular, airway, ureteral, biliary). Malignancies The table below summarizes the incidence of malignancies in the two controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) for the prevention of acute rejection [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. At 24 months (Study 1) and 36 months (Study 2), there were no significant differences among treatment groups. TABLE 2: INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 1 (24 MONTHS) AND STUDY 2 (36 MONTHS) POST-TRANSPLANTPatients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. , Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. Malignancy Sirolimus Oral Solution 2 mg/day Sirolimus Oral Solution 5 mg/day Azathioprine 2–3 mg/kg/day Placebo Study 1 (n = 284) Study 2 (n = 227) Study 1 (n = 274) Study 2 (n = 219) Study 1 (n = 161) Study 2 (n = 130) Lymphoma/ lymphoproliferative disease 0.7 1.8 1.1 3.2 0.6 0.8 Skin Carcinoma Any Squamous CellPatients may be counted in more than one category. 0.4 2.7 2.2 0.9 3.8 3.0 Any Basal Cell 0.7 2.2 1.5 1.8 2.5 5.3 Melanoma 0.0 0.4 0.0 1.4 0.0 0.0 Miscellaneous/Not Specified 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.8 Total 1.1 4.4 3.3 4.1 4.3 7.7 Other Malignancy 1.1 2.2 1.5 1.4 0.6 2.3 6.2 Sirolimus Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal The incidence of adverse reactions was determined through 36 months in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial (Study 3) in which 215 renal transplant patients received sirolimus as a maintenance regimen following cyclosporine withdrawal, and 215 patients received sirolimus with cyclosporine therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. All patients were treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile prior to randomization (start of cyclosporine withdrawal) was similar to that of the 2 mg sirolimus groups in Studies 1 and 2. Following randomization (at 3 months), patients who had cyclosporine eliminated from their therapy experienced higher incidences of the following adverse reactions: abnormal liver function tests (including increased AST/SGOT and increased ALT/SGPT), hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal healing. Conversely, the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in patients who remained on cyclosporine than those who had cyclosporine withdrawn from therapy: hypertension, cyclosporine toxicity, increased creatinine, abnormal kidney function, toxic nephropathy, edema, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and gum hyperplasia. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved significantly following cyclosporine withdrawal. Malignancies The incidence of malignancies in Study 3 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] is presented in the table following. In Study 3, the incidence of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease was similar in all treatment groups. The overall incidence of malignancy was higher in patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine compared with patients who had cyclosporine withdrawn. Conclusions regarding these differences in the incidence of malignancy could not be made because Study 3 was not designed to consider malignancy risk factors or systematically screen subjects for malignancy. In addition, more patients in the sirolimus with cyclosporine group had a pretransplantation history of skin carcinoma. TABLE 3: INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 3 (CYCLOSPORINE WITHDRAWAL STUDY) AT 36 MONTHS POST-TRANSPLANTPatients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. , Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. Malignancy Nonrandomized (n = 95) Sirolimus with Cyclosporine Therapy (n = 215) Sirolimus Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal (n = 215) Lymphoma/ lymphoproliferative disease 1.1 1.4 0.5 Skin Carcinoma Any Squamous CellPatients may be counted in more than one category. 3.2 3.3 2.3 Any Basal Cell 3.2 6.5 2.3 Melanoma 0.0 0.5 0.0 Miscellaneous/Not Specified 1.1 0.9 0.0 Total 4.2 7.9 3.7 Other Malignancy 3.2 3.3 1.9 6.3 High-Immunologic Risk Renal Transplant Patients Safety was assessed in 224 patients who received at least one dose of sirolimus with cyclosporine [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Overall, the incidence and nature of adverse events was similar to those seen in previous combination studies with sirolimus. The incidence of malignancy was 1.3% at 12 months. 6.4 Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitors to Sirolimus in Maintenance Renal Transplant Population The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant population have not been established [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. In a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus (initial target sirolimus concentrations of 12–20 ng/mL, and then 8–20 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients (n = 87) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min. There was a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death, in this stratum of the sirolimus treatment arm. The subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min had 2 years of follow-up after randomization. In this population, the rate of pneumonia was 15/58 vs. 4/29, graft loss (excluding death with functioning graft loss) was 13/58 vs. 9/29, and death was 9/58 vs. 1/29 in the sirolimus conversion group and CNI continuation group, respectively. In the subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of greater than 40 mL/min, there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the sirolimus conversion arm. Overall in this study, a 5-fold increase in the reports of tuberculosis among sirolimus (11/551) and comparator (1/273) treatment groups was observed with 2:1 randomization scheme. 6.5 Pediatric Renal Transplant Patients Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (<18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. The use of sirolimus in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections. 6.6 Patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Safety was assessed in a controlled trial involving 89 patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, 46 of whom were treated with sirolimus [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ]. The adverse drug reactions observed in this trial were consistent with the known safety profile for renal transplant patients receiving sirolimus, with the addition of weight decreased which was reported at a greater incidence with sirolimus when compared to placebo. Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of ≥ 20% in the sirolimus treatment group and greater than placebo include stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, acne, chest pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and hypercholesterolemia. 6.7 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sirolimus in transplant patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole – Lymphedema. Cardiovascular – Pericardial effusion (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults) and fluid accumulation. Digestive System – Ascites. Hematological/Lymphatic – The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ]; pancytopenia, neutropenia. Hepatobiliary Disorders – Hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic necrosis, with elevated sirolimus trough concentrations. Immune System – Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Infections – Tuberculosis. BK virus associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis. Metabolic/Nutritional – Liver function test abnormal, AST/SGOT increased, ALT/SGPT increased, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus. Nervous System - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Respiratory – Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the sirolimus trough concentration increases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]; pulmonary hemorrhage; pleural effusion; alveolar proteinosis. Skin – Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Urogenital – Nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Azoospermia has been reported with the use of sirolimus and has been reversible upon discontinuation of sirolimus in most cases."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions (5.4) Angioedema (5.5) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing (5.6) Hyperlipidemia (5.7) Renal Function (5.8) Proteinuria (5.9) Latent Viral Infections (5.10) Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis (5.11) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine (5.12) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (5.13) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7–3.2% (for sirolimus -treated patients) versus 0.6–0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2) ]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use sirolimus for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation – Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of sirolimus has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT). In a study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6–144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI-based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. 5.3 Lung Transplantation – Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of sirolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.7) ]. 5.5 Angioedema Sirolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of sirolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving sirolimus, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with sirolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving sirolimus. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with sirolimus compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43–46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45–57%) in patients receiving sirolimus compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including sirolimus. Any patient who is administered sirolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine or sirolimus after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse events such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (<1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of sirolimus on cardiovascular mortality. During sirolimus therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the co-administration of sirolimus with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and sirolimus were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving sirolimus and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of sirolimus and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients 6–120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to sirolimus compared with CNI continuation [see Clinical Studies (14.4), Adverse Reactions (6.4) ]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio >3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see Adverse Reactions (6.7) ]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis Cases of interstitial lung disease [ILD] (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the ILD was associated with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]). In some cases, the ILD has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see Adverse Reactions (6.7) ]. 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Adverse Reactions (6.7) ]. 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in transplant patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Different Sirolimus Trough Concentration Reported between Chromatographic and Immunoassay Methodologies Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Co-administration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. •Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations (7.4, 12.3). •Exercise caution when administering with drugs that are inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/P-gp (7.4, 12.3). 7.1 Use with Cyclosporine Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when co-administered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that sirolimus be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED). If cyclosporine is withdrawn from combination therapy with sirolimus, higher doses of sirolimus are needed to maintain the recommended sirolimus trough concentration ranges [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with sirolimus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The dosage of sirolimus and/or the co-administered drug may need to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. •Drugs that could increase sirolimus blood concentrations: Bromocriptione, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, protease inhibitors (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C that include drugs such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil •Drugs and other agents that could decrease sirolimus concentrations: Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) •Drugs with concentrations that could increase when given with sirolimus: Verapamil 7.5 Vaccination Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with sirolimus, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. •Increased susceptibility to infection, lymphoma, and malignancy [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis in liver transplant patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Bronchial anastomotic dehiscence in lung transplant patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] •Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] • Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] • Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] • Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] •Decline in renal function in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] • Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] •Interstitial lung disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] •Increased risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ]. The most common (≥ 30%) adverse reactions observed with sirolimus in clinical studies are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia. The following adverse reactions resulted in a rate of discontinuation of > 5% in clinical trials: creatinine increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The most common (> 30%) adverse reactions are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia (6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience in Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection Following Renal Transplantation The safety and efficacy of sirolimus oral solution for the prevention of organ rejection following renal transplantation were assessed in two randomized, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The safety profiles in the two studies were similar. The incidence of adverse reactions in the randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo- controlled trial (Study 2) in which 219 renal transplant patients received sirolimus oral solution 2 mg/day, 208 received sirolimus oral solution 5 mg/day, and 124 received placebo is presented in the table below. The study population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 71 years), the distribution was 67% male, and the composition by race was: White (78%), Black (11%), Asian (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Other (5%). All patients were treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Data (≥ 12 months post-transplant) presented in the following table show the adverse reactions that occurred in at least one of the sirolimus treatment groups with an incidence of ≥ 20%. The safety profile of the tablet did not differ from that of the oral solution formulation [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In general, adverse reactions related to the administration of sirolimus were dependent on dose/concentration. Although a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg, with a loading dose of 15 mg, was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage over the 2 mg dose could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 5 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. ADVERSE REACTIONS OCCURRING AT A FREQUENCY OF ≥ 20% IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE SIROLIMUS TREATMENT GROUPS IN A STUDY OF PROPHYLAXIS OF ORGAN REJECTION FOLLOWING RENAL TRANSPLANTATION (%) AT ≥ 12 MONTHS POST‑-TRANSPLANTATION (STUDY 2)a a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. –––Sirolimus Oral Solution––– 2 mg/day 5 mg/day Placebo Adverse Reaction (n = 218) (n = 208) (n = 124) Peripheral edema 54 58 48 Hypertriglyceridemia 45 57 23 Hypertension 45 49 48 Hypercholesterolemia 43 46 23 Creatinine increased 39 40 38 Constipation 36 38 31 Abdominal pain 29 36 30 Diarrhea 25 35 27 Headache 34 34 31 Fever 23 34 35 Urinary tract infection 26 33 26 Anemia 23 33 21 Nausea 25 31 29 Arthralgia 25 31 18 Thrombocytopenia 14 30 9 Pain 33 29 25 Acne 22 22 19 Rash 10 20 6 Edema 20 18 15 The following adverse reactions were reported less frequently (≥ 3%, but < 20%) •Body as a Whole— Sepsis, lymphocele, herpes zoster, herpes simplex. •Cardiovascular— Venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis), tachycardia. •Digestive System— Stomatitis. •Hematologic and Lymphatic System— Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), leukopenia. •Metabolic/Nutritional— Abnormal healing, increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), hypokalemia. •Musculoskeletal System— Bone necrosis. •Respiratory System— Pneumonia, epistaxis. •Skin— Melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma. • Urogenital System— Pyelonephritis, decline in renal function (creatinine increased) in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ], ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Less frequently (< 3%) occurring adverse reactions included: lymphoma/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, mycobacterial infections (including M. tuberculosis), pancreatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Increased Serum Cholesterol and Triglycerides The use of sirolimus in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment. In Studies 1 and 2, in de novo renal transplant patients who began the study with fasting, total serum cholesterol < 200 mg/dL or fasting, total serum triglycerides < 200 mg/dL, there was an increased incidence of hypercholesterolemia (fasting serum cholesterol > 240 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (fasting serum triglycerides > 500 mg/dL), respectively, in patients receiving both sirolimus 2 mg and sirolimus 5 mg compared with azathioprine and placebo controls. Treatment of new-onset hypercholesterolemia with lipid-lowering agents was required in 42 to 52% of patients enrolled in the sirolimus arms of Studies 1 and 2 compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 22% of patients in the azathioprine arm. In other sirolimus renal transplant studies, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Abnormal Healing Abnormal healing events following transplant surgery include fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and anastomosis disruption (e.g., wound, vascular, airway, ureteral, biliary). Malignancies The table below summarizes the incidence of malignancies in the two controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) for the prevention of acute rejection [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. At 24 months (Study 1) and 36 months (Study 2), there were no significant differences among treatment groups. INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 1 (24 MONTHS) AND STUDY 2 (36 MONTHS) POST-TRANSPLANTa,b a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. c: Patients may be counted in more than one category.

All patients were treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile prior to randomization (start of cyclosporine withdrawal) was similar to that of the 2 mg sirolimus groups in Studies 1 and 2. Following randomization (at 3 months), patients who had cyclosporine eliminated from their therapy experienced higher incidences of the following adverse reactions: abnormal liver function tests (including increased AST/SGOT and increased ALT/SGPT), hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal healing. Conversely, the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in patients who remained on cyclosporine than those who had cyclosporine withdrawn from therapy: hypertension, cyclosporine toxicity, increased creatinine, abnormal kidney function, toxic nephropathy, edema, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and gum hyperplasia. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved significantly following cyclosporine withdrawal. Malignancies The incidence of malignancies in Study 3 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] is presented in the table following. In Study 3, the incidence of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease was similar in all treatment groups. The overall incidence of malignancy was higher in patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine compared with patients who had cyclosporine withdrawn. Conclusions regarding these differences in the incidence of malignancy could not be made because Study 3 was not designed to consider malignancy risk factors or systematically screen subjects for malignancy. In addition, more patients in the sirolimus with cyclosporine group had a pretransplantation history of skin carcinoma. INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 3 (CYCLOSPORINE WITHDRAWAL STUDY) AT 36 MONTHS POST-TRANSPLANTa,b a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. c: Patients may be counted in more than one category.

Overall, the incidence and nature of adverse events was similar to those seen in previous combination studies with sirolimus. The incidence of malignancy was 1.3% at 12 months. 6.4 Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitors to Sirolimus in Maintenance Renal Transplant Population The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant population have not been established [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. In a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus (initial target sirolimus concentrations of 12 to 20 ng/mL, and then 8 to 20 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients (n = 87) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min. There was a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death, in this stratum of the sirolimus treatment arm. The subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min had 2 years of follow-up after randomization. In this population, the rate of pneumonia was 15/58 vs.4/29, graft loss (excluding death with functioning graft loss) was 13/58 vs. 9/29, and death was 9/58 vs. 1/29 in the sirolimus conversion group and CNI continuation group, respectively. In the subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of greater than 40 mL/min, there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the sirolimus conversion arm. Overall in this study, a 5-fold increase in the reports of tuberculosis among sirolimus (11/551) and comparator (1/273) treatment groups was observed with 2:1 randomization scheme. 6.5 Pediatrics Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (< 18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. The use of sirolimus in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections. 6.6 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sirolimus. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. •Body as a Whole— Lymphedema. •Cardiovascular— Pericardial effusion (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults) and accumulation. •Digestive System : Ascites •Hematological/Lymphatic— The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ) ]; pancytopenia, neutropenia. •Hepatobiliary Disorders— Hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic necrosis, with elevated sirolimus trough concentrations. •Immune System— Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. •Infections— Tuberculosis. BK virus associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ]. Colstridium difficile enterocolitis. •Metabolic/Nutritional— Liver function test abnormal, AST/SGOT increased, ALT/SGPT increased, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia. •Respiratory— Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the sirolimus trough concentration increases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) ]; pulmonary hemorrhage; pleural effusion; alveolar proteinosis. •Skin— Exfoliative dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. •Urogenital— Nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Azoospermia has been reported with the use of sirolimus and has been reversible upon discontinuation of sirolimus in most cases."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypersensitivity Reactions (5.4) •Angioedema (5.5) •Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing (5.6) •Hyperlipidemia (5.7) •Renal Function (5.8) •Proteinuria (5.9) •Latent Viral Infections (5.10) •Interstitial Lung Disease (5.11) • De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine (5.12) •Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (5.13) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7 to 3.2% (for sirolimus-treated patients) versus 0.6 to 0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2) ]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use sirolimus. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation - Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of sirolimus has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT). In a study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post- transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6 to 144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI- based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. 5.3 Lung Transplantation — Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of sirolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.6)]. 5.5 Angioedema Sirolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of sirolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving sirolimus, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with sirolimus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving sirolimus. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with sirolimus compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43 to 46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45 to 57%) in patients receiving sirolimus compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including sirolimus. Any patient who is administered sirolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine or sirolimus after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse events such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (<1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of sirolimus on cardiovascular mortality. During sirolimus therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the co-administration of sirolimus with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and sirolimus were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving sirolimus and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of sirolimus and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients 6 to 120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to sirolimus compared with CNI continuation [see Clinical Studies (14.4), Adverse Reactions (6.4) ]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Assay for Sirolimus Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Co-administration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations (7.4, 12.3). Exercise caution when administering with drugs that are inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/P-gp (7.4, 12.3). Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. 7.1 Use with Cyclosporine Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when coadministered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that sirolimus be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED). If cyclosporine is withdrawn from combination therapy with sirolimus, higher doses of sirolimus are needed to maintain the recommended sirolimus trough concentration ranges [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.2 Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.17), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 Grapefruit Juice Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with or be used for dilution of sirolimus [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.7), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The dosage of sirolimus and/or the coadministered drug may need to be adjusted [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Drugs that could increase sirolimus blood concentrations Bromocriptione, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, protease inhibitors (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C that include drugs such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil Drugs and other agents that could decrease sirolimus concentrations: Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum ) Drugs with concentrations that could increase when given with sirolimus: Verapamil 7.5 Vaccination Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with sirolimus, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (> 30%) adverse reactions are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia (6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. Increased susceptibility to infection, lymphoma, and malignancy [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ] Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis in liver transplant patients [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) ] Bronchial anastomotic dehiscence in lung transplant patients [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ] Exfoliative dermatitis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ] Angioedema [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5) ] Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6) ] Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7) ] Decline in renal function in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8) ] Proteinuria [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9) ] Interstitial lung disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.11) ] Increased risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13) ]. The most common (≥ 30%) adverse reactions observed with sirolimus in clinical studies are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia. The following adverse reactions resulted in a rate of discontinuation of > 5% in clinical trials: creatinine increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience in Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection Following Renal Transplantation The safety and efficacy of sirolimus oral solution for the prevention of organ rejection following renal transplantation were assessed in two randomized, double blind, multicenter, controlled trials [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.1 )]. The safety profiles in the two studies were similar. The incidence of adverse reactions in the randomized, double blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2) in which 219 renal transplant patients received sirolimus oral solution 2 mg/day, 208 received sirolimus oral solution 5 mg/day, and 124 received placebo is presented in the table below. The study population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 71 years), the distribution was 67% male, and the composition by race was: White (78%), Black (11%), Asian (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Other (5%). All patients were treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Data (≥ 12 months post-transplant) presented in the following table show the adverse reactions that occurred in at least one of the sirolimus treatment groups with an incidence of ≥ 20%. The safety profile of the tablet did not differ from that of the oral solution formulation [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)]. In general, adverse reactions related to the administration of sirolimus were dependent on dose/concentration. Although a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg, with a loading dose of 15 mg, was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage over the 2 mg dose could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 5 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. ADVERSE REACTIONS OCCURRING AT A FREQUENCY OF ≥ 20% IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE SIROLIMUS TREATMENT GROUPS IN A STUDY OF PROPHYLAXIS OF ORGAN REJECTION FOLLOWING RENAL TRANSPLANTATION (%) AT ≥ 12 MONTHS POSTTRANSPLANTATION (STUDY 2)a a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. ––– Sirolimus Oral Solution ––– Adverse Reaction 2 mg / day ( n = 218 ) 5 mg / day ( n = 208 ) Placebo ( n = 124 ) Peripheral edema 54 58 48 Hypertriglyceridemia 45 57 23 Hypertension 45 49 48 Hypercholesterolemia 43 46 23 Creatinine increased 39 40 38 Constipation 36 38 31 Abdominal pain 29 36 30 Diarrhea 25 35 27 Headache 34 34 31 Fever 23 34 35 Urinary tract infection 26 33 26 Anemia 23 33 21 Nausea 25 31 29 Arthralgia 25 31 18 Thrombocytopenia 14 30 9 Pain 33 29 25 Acne 22 22 19 Rash 10 20 6 Edema 20 18 15 The following adverse reactions were reported less frequently (≥ 3%, but < 20%) Body as a Whole – Sepsis, lymphocele, herpes zoster, herpes simplex.

Hematologic and Lymphatic System – Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), leukopenia. Metabolic/Nutritional – Abnormal healing, increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), hypokalemia. Musculoskeletal System – Bone necrosis. Respiratory System – Pneumonia, epistaxis. Skin – Melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma. Urogenital System – Pyelonephritis, decline in renal function (creatinine increased) in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8) ], ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Less frequently (< 3%) occurring adverse reactions included: lymphoma/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, mycobacterial infections (including M. tuberculosis), pancreatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Increased Serum Cholesterol and Triglycerides The use of sirolimus in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment. In Studies 1 and 2, in de novo renal transplant patients who began the study with fasting, total serum cholesterol < 200 mg/dL or fasting, total serum triglycerides < 200 mg/dL, there was an increased incidence of hypercholesterolemia (fasting serum cholesterol > 240 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (fasting serum triglycerides > 500 mg/dL), respectively, in patients receiving both sirolimus 2 mg and sirolimus 5 mg compared with azathioprine and placebo controls. Treatment of new-onset hypercholesterolemia with lipid-lowering agents was required in 42 to 52% of patients enrolled in the sirolimus arms of Studies 1 and 2 compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 22% of patients in the azathioprine arm. In other sirolimus renal transplant studies, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels > 240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. Abnormal Healing Abnormal healing events following transplant surgery include fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and anastomosis disruption (e.g., wound, vascular, airway, ureteral, biliary). Malignancies The table below summarizes the incidence of malignancies in the two controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) for the prevention of acute rejection [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)]. At 24 months (Study 1) and 36 months (Study 2), there were no significant differences among treatment groups.

All patients were treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile prior to randomization (start of cyclosporine withdrawal) was similar to that of the 2 mg sirolimus groups in Studies 1 and 2. Following randomization (at 3 months), patients who had cyclosporine eliminated from their therapy experienced higher incidences of the following adverse reactions: abnormal liver function tests (including increased AST/SGOT and increased ALT/SGPT), hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal healing. Conversely, the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in patients who remained on cyclosporine than those who had cyclosporine withdrawn from therapy: hypertension, cyclosporine toxicity, increased creatinine, abnormal kidney function, toxic nephropathy, edema, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and gum hyperplasia. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved significantly following cyclosporine withdrawal. Malignancies The incidence of malignancies in Study 3 [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)] is presented in the table following. In Study 3, the incidence of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease was similar in all treatment groups. The overall incidence of malignancy was higher in patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine compared with patients who had cyclosporine withdrawn. Conclusions regarding these differences in the incidence of malignancy could not be made because Study 3 was not designed to consider malignancy risk factors or systematically screen subjects for malignancy. In addition, more patients in the sirolimus with cyclosporine group had a pretransplantation history of skin carcinoma.

Overall, the incidence and nature of adverse events was similar to those seen in previous combination studies with sirolimus. The incidence of malignancy was 1.3 % at 12 months. 6.4 Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitors to sirolimus in Maintenance Renal Transplant Population The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant population have not been established [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4)]. In a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus (initial target sirolimus concentrations of 12 to 20 ng/mL, and then 8 to 20 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients (n = 87) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min. There was a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death, in this stratum of the sirolimus treatment arm. The subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min had 2 years of follow-up after randomization. In this population, the rate of pneumonia was 15/58 vs. 4/29, graft loss (excluding death with functioning graft loss) was 13/58 vs. 9/29, and death was 9/58 vs. 1/29 in the sirolimus conversion group and CNI continuation group, respectively. In the subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of greater than 40 mL/min, there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the sirolimus conversion arm. Overall in this study, a 5-fold increase in the reports of tuberculosis among sirolimus (11/551) and comparator (1/273) treatment groups was observed with 2:1 randomization scheme. 6.5 Pediatrics Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (< 18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.6)]. The use of sirolimus in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections. 6.6 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sirolimus. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole – Lymphedema. Cardiovascular – Pericardial effusion (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults) and fluid accumulation. Digestive System – Ascites. Hematological/Lymphatic – The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13) ]; pancytopenia, neutropenia. Hepatobiliary Disorders – Hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic necrosis, with elevated sirolimus trough concentrations. Immune System - Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ]. Infections – Tuberculosis. BK virus associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10) ]. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis. Metabolic/Nutritional – Liver function test abnormal, AST/SGOT increased, ALT/SGPT increased, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia. Respiratory – Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the sirolimus trough concentration increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.11) ]; pulmonary hemorrhage; pleural effusion; alveolar proteinosis. Skin – Exfoliative dermatitis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ]. Urogenital - Nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Azoospermia has been reported with the use of sirolimus and has been reversible upon discontinuation of sirolimus in most cases."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions (5.4) Angioedema (5.5) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing (5.6) Hyperlipidemia (5.7) Renal Function (5.8) Proteinuria (5.9) Latents Viral Infections (5.10) Interstitial Lung Disease (5.11) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine (5.12) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (5.13) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7 to 3.2% (for Sirolimus-treated patients) versus 0.6 to 0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) and (6.2)]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use sirolimus. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation - Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of sirolimus has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT). In a study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6 to 144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI-based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.5)]. 5.3 Lung Transplantation – Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of sirolimus [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.6)]. 5.5 Angioedema Sirolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of sirolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving sirolimus, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with sirolimus [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving sirolimus. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with sirolimus compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43 to 46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45 to 57%) in patients receiving sirolimus compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including sirolimus. Any patient who is administered sirolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine or sirolimus after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels > 240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse events such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (< 1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of sirolimus on cardiovascular mortality. During sirolimus therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the coadministration of sirolimus with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and sirolimus were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving sirolimus and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of sirolimus and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients 6 to 120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to sirolimus compared with CNI continuation [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4), ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.4)]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.6)]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.6)]. 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.6)]. 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Assay for Sirolimus Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Coadministration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations (7.4, 12.3). Exercise caution when administering with drugs that are inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/P-gp (7.4,12.3). Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. 7.1 Use with Cyclosporine Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when coadministered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that sirolimus be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED). If cyclosporine is withdrawn from combination therapy with sirolimus, higher doses of sirolimus are needed to maintain the recommended sirolimus trough concentration ranges [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.2), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.2 Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.17), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.3 Grapefruit Juice Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with or be used for dilution of sirolimus [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The dosage of sirolimus and/or the coadministered drug may need to be adjusted [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. Drugs that could increase sirolimus blood concentrations Bromocriptione, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, protease inhibitors (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C that include drugs such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil Drugs and other agents that could decrease sirolimus concentrations: Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum ) Drugs with concentrations that could increase when given with sirolimus: Verapamil 7.5 Vaccination Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with sirolimus, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 30%) are peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia (6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. Increased susceptibility to infection, lymphoma, and malignancy [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ] Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis in liver transplant patients [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) ] Bronchial anastomotic dehiscence in lung transplant patients [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ] Exfoliative dermatitis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ] Angioedema [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5) ] Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6) ] Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7) ] Decline in renal function in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8) ] Proteinuria [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9) ] Interstitial lung disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.11) ] Increased risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13) ]. The most common (≥ 30%) adverse reactions observed with sirolimus in clinical studies for organ rejection prophylaxis in recipients of renal transplantation are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia. The following adverse reactions resulted in a rate of discontinuation of > 5% in clinical trials for renal transplant rejection prophylaxis: creatinine increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience in Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection Following Renal Transplantation The safety and efficacy of sirolimus oral solution for the prevention of organ rejection following renal transplantation were assessed in two randomized, double blind, multicenter, controlled trials [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.1 )]. The safety profiles in the two studies were similar. The incidence of adverse reactions in the randomized, double blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2) in which 219 renal transplant patients received sirolimus oral solution 2 mg/day, 208 received sirolimus oral solution 5 mg/day, and 124 received placebo is presented in the table below. The study population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 71 years), the distribution was 67% male, and the composition by race was: White (78%), Black (11%), Asian (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Other (5%). All patients were treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Data (≥ 12 months post-transplant) presented in the following table show the adverse reactions that occurred in at least one of the sirolimus treatment groups with an incidence of ≥ 20%. The safety profile of the tablet did not differ from that of the oral solution formulation [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)]. In general, adverse reactions related to the administration of sirolimus were dependent on dose/concentration. Although a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg, with a loading dose of 15 mg, was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage over the 2 mg dose could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 5 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Hematologic and Lymphatic System – Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), leukopenia. Metabolic/Nutritional – Abnormal healing, increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), hypokalemia, diabetes mellitus. Musculoskeletal System – Bone necrosis. Respiratory System – Pneumonia, epistaxis.

Urogenital System – Pyelonephritis, decline in renal function (creatinine increased) in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8) ], ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Less frequently (< 3%) occurring adverse reactions included: lymphoma/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, mycobacterial infections (including M. tuberculosis), pancreatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Increased Serum Cholesterol and Triglycerides The use of sirolimus in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment. In Studies 1 and 2, in de novo renal transplant patients who began the study with fasting, total serum cholesterol < 200 mg/dL or fasting, total serum triglycerides < 200 mg/dL, there was an increased incidence of hypercholesterolemia (fasting serum cholesterol > 240 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (fasting serum triglycerides > 500 mg/dL), respectively, in patients receiving both sirolimus 2 mg and sirolimus 5 mg compared with azathioprine and placebo controls. Treatment of new-onset hypercholesterolemia with lipid-lowering agents was required in 42 to 52% of patients enrolled in the sirolimus arms of Studies 1 and 2 compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 22% of patients in the azathioprine arm. In other sirolimus renal transplant studies, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels > 240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. Abnormal Healing Abnormal healing events following transplant surgery include fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and anastomosis disruption (e.g., wound, vascular, airway, ureteral, biliary). Malignancies The table below summarizes the incidence of malignancies in the two controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) for the prevention of acute rejection [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)]. At 24 months (Study 1) and 36 months (Study 2), there were no significant differences among treatment groups.

All patients were treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile prior to randomization (start of cyclosporine withdrawal) was similar to that of the 2 mg sirolimus groups in Studies 1 and 2. Following randomization (at 3 months), patients who had cyclosporine eliminated from their therapy experienced higher incidences of the following adverse reactions: abnormal liver function tests (including increased AST/SGOT and increased ALT/SGPT), hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal healing. Conversely, the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in patients who remained on cyclosporine than those who had cyclosporine withdrawn from therapy: hypertension, cyclosporine toxicity, increased creatinine, abnormal kidney function, toxic nephropathy, edema, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and gum hyperplasia. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved significantly following cyclosporine withdrawal. Malignancies The incidence of malignancies in Study 3 [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)] is presented in the table following. In Study 3, the incidence of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease was similar in all treatment groups. The overall incidence of malignancy was higher in patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine compared with patients who had cyclosporine withdrawn. Conclusions regarding these differences in the incidence of malignancy could not be made because Study 3 was not designed to consider malignancy risk factors or systematically screen subjects for malignancy. In addition, more patients in the sirolimus with cyclosporine group had a pretransplantation history of skin carcinoma.

Overall, the incidence and nature of adverse events was similar to those seen in previous combination studies with sirolimus. The incidence of malignancy was 1.3 % at 12 months. 6.4 Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitors to sirolimus in Maintenance Renal Transplant Population The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant population have not been established [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4)]. In a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus (initial target sirolimus concentrations of 12 to 20 ng/mL, and then 8 to 20 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients (n = 87) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min. There was a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death, in this stratum of the sirolimus treatment arm. The subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min had 2 years of follow-up after randomization. In this population, the rate of pneumonia was 15/58 vs. 4/29, graft loss (excluding death with functioning graft loss) was 13/58 vs. 9/29, and death was 9/58 vs. 1/29 in the sirolimus conversion group and CNI continuation group, respectively. In the subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of greater than 40 mL/min, there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the sirolimus conversion arm. Overall in this study, a 5-fold increase in the reports of tuberculosis among sirolimus (11/551) and comparator (1/273) treatment groups was observed with 2:1 randomization scheme. 6.5 Pediatric Renal Transplant Patients Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (< 18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.6)]. The use of sirolimus in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections. 6.7 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sirolimus in transplant patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole – Lymphedema. Cardiovascular – Pericardial effusion (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults) and fluid accumulation. Digestive System – Ascites. Hematological/Lymphatic – The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13) ]; pancytopenia, neutropenia. Hepatobiliary Disorders – Hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic necrosis, with elevated sirolimus trough concentrations. Immune System - Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ]. Infections – Tuberculosis. BK virus associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10) ]. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis. Metabolic/Nutritional – Liver function test abnormal, AST/SGOT increased, ALT/SGPT increased, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus. Nervous system - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Respiratory – Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the sirolimus trough concentration increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.11) ]; pulmonary hemorrhage; pleural effusion; alveolar proteinosis. Skin – Exfoliative dermatitis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ]. Urogenital - Nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Azoospermia has been reported with the use of sirolimus and has been reversible upon discontinuation of sirolimus in most cases."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions (5.4) Angioedema (5.5) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing (5.6) Hyperlipidemia (5.7) Renal Function (5.8) Proteinuria (5.9) Latents Viral Infections (5.10) Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis (5.11) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine (5.12) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA (5.13) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7 to 3.2% (for Sirolimus-treated patients) versus 0.6 to 0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) and (6.2)]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use Sirolimus for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation - Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of sirolimus has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT). In a study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6 to 144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI-based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.5)]. 5.3 Lung Transplantation – Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of sirolimus [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.7)]. 5.5 Angioedema Sirolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of sirolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving sirolimus, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with sirolimus [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving sirolimus. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with sirolimus compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43 to 46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45 to 57%) in patients receiving sirolimus compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including sirolimus. Any patient who is administered sirolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine or sirolimus after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels > 240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse events such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (< 1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of sirolimus on cardiovascular mortality. During sirolimus therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the coadministration of sirolimus with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and sirolimus were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving sirolimus and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of sirolimus and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients 6 to 120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to sirolimus compared with CNI continuation [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.4), ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.4)]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.7)]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis Cases of interstitial lung disease [ILD] (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the ILD was reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]) as a secondary event. In some cases, the ILD has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.7)]. 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.7)]. 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in transplant patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Different Sirolimus Trough Concentration Reported between Chromatographic and Immunoassay Methodologies Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5)]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Coadministration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations ( 7.4, 12.3). Exercise caution when administering with drugs that are inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4/P-gp ( 7.4, 12.3). Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase sirolimus concentrations. 7.1 Use with Cyclosporine Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when coadministered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that sirolimus be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED). If cyclosporine is withdrawn from combination therapy with sirolimus, higher doses of sirolimus are needed to maintain the recommended sirolimus trough concentration ranges [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.2) , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3) ]. 7.2 Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.17) , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3) ]. 7.3 Grapefruit Juice Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with or be used for dilution of sirolimus [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.3) , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3) ]. 7.4 Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The dosage of sirolimus and/or the coadministered drug may need to be adjusted [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12.3) ]. Drugs that could increase sirolimus blood concentrations Bromocriptione, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, protease inhibitors (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C that include drugs such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil Drugs and other agents that could decrease sirolimus concentrations: Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) Drugs with concentrations that could increase when given with sirolimus: Verapamil 7.5 Vaccination Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with sirolimus, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid."

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 30%) are peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia ( 6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-993-8779, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. Increased susceptibility to infection, lymphoma, and malignancy [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1) ] Excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis in liver transplant patients [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2) ] Bronchial anastomotic dehiscence in lung transplant patients [see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.3) ] Hypersensitivity reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4) ] Exfoliative dermatitis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4) ] Angioedema [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.5) ] Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6) ] Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7) ] Decline in renal function in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.8) ] Proteinuria [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.9) ] Interstitial lung disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.11) ] Increased risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.13) ]. The most common (≥ 30%) adverse reactions observed with sirolimus in clinical studies for organ rejection prophylaxis in recipients of renal transplantation are: peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia. The following adverse reactions resulted in a rate of discontinuation of > 5% in clinical trials for renal transplant rejection prophylaxis: creatinine increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience in Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection Following Renal Transplantation The safety and efficacy of sirolimus oral solution for the prevention of organ rejection following renal transplantation were assessed in two randomized, double blind, multicenter, controlled trials [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.1 )]. The safety profiles in the two studies were similar. The incidence of adverse reactions in the randomized, double blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2) in which 219 renal transplant patients received sirolimus oral solution 2 mg/day, 208 received sirolimus oral solution 5 mg/day, and 124 received placebo is presented in the table below. The study population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 71 years), the distribution was 67% male, and the composition by race was: White (78%), Black (11%), Asian (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Other (5%). All patients were treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Data (≥ 12 months post-transplant) presented in the following table show the adverse reactions that occurred in at least one of the sirolimus treatment groups with an incidence of ≥ 20%. The safety profile of the tablet did not differ from that of the oral solution formulation [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.1) ]. In general, adverse reactions related to the administration of sirolimus were dependent on dose/concentration. Although a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg, with a loading dose of 15 mg, was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage over the 2 mg dose could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 5 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. TABLE 1 ADVERSE REACTIONS OCCURRING AT A FREQUENCY OF ≥ 20% IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE SIROLIMUS TREATMENT GROUPS IN A STUDY OF PROPHYLAXIS OF ORGAN REJECTION FOLLOWING RENAL TRANSPLANTATION (%) AT ≥ 12 MONTHS POSTTRANSPLANTATION (STUDY 2) a a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. –––Sirolimus Oral Solution––– Adverse Reaction 2 mg/day (n = 218) 5 mg/day (n = 208) Placebo (n = 124) Peripheral edema 54 58 48 Hypertriglyceridemia 45 57 23 Hypertension 45 49 48 Hypercholesterolemia 43 46 23 Creatinine increased 39 40 38 Constipation 36 38 31 Abdominal pain 29 36 30 Diarrhea 25 35 27 Headache 34 34 31 Fever 23 34 35 Urinary tract infection 26 33 26 Anemia 23 33 21 Nausea 25 31 29 Arthralgia 25 31 18 Thrombocytopenia 14 30 9 Pain 33 29 25 Acne 22 22 19 Rash 10 20 6 Edema 20 18 15 The following adverse reactions were reported less frequently (≥ 3%, but < 20%) Body as a Whole – Sepsis, lymphocele, herpes zoster, herpes simplex.

Hematologic and Lymphatic System – Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), leukopenia. Metabolic/Nutritional – Abnormal healing, increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), hypokalemia, diabetes mellitus. Musculoskeletal System – Bone necrosis. Respiratory System – Pneumonia, epistaxis. Skin – Melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma. Urogenital System – Pyelonephritis, decline in renal function (creatinine increased) in long-term combination of cyclosporine with sirolimus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.8) ], ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Less frequently (< 3%) occurring adverse reactions included: lymphoma/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, mycobacterial infections (including M. tuberculosis), pancreatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Increased Serum Cholesterol and Triglycerides The use of sirolimus in renal transplant patients was associated with increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides that may require treatment. In Studies 1 and 2, in de novo renal transplant patients who began the study with fasting, total serum cholesterol < 200 mg/dL or fasting, total serum triglycerides < 200 mg/dL, there was an increased incidence of hypercholesterolemia (fasting serum cholesterol > 240 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (fasting serum triglycerides > 500 mg/dL), respectively, in patients receiving both sirolimus 2 mg and sirolimus 5 mg compared with azathioprine and placebo controls. Treatment of new-onset hypercholesterolemia with lipid-lowering agents was required in 42 to 52% of patients enrolled in the sirolimus arms of Studies 1 and 2 compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 22% of patients in the azathioprine arm. In other sirolimus renal transplant studies, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels > 240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7) ]. Abnormal Healing Abnormal healing events following transplant surgery include fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and anastomosis disruption (e.g., wound, vascular, airway, ureteral, biliary). Malignancies The table below summarizes the incidence of malignancies in the two controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) for the prevention of acute rejection [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.1) ]. At 24 months (Study 1) and 36 months (Study 2), there were no significant differences among treatment groups.

All patients were treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile prior to randomization (start of cyclosporine withdrawal) was similar to that of the 2 mg sirolimus groups in Studies 1 and 2. Following randomization (at 3 months), patients who had cyclosporine eliminated from their therapy experienced higher incidences of the following adverse reactions: abnormal liver function tests (including increased AST/SGOT and increased ALT/SGPT), hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal healing. Conversely, the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in patients who remained on cyclosporine than those who had cyclosporine withdrawn from therapy: hypertension, cyclosporine toxicity, increased creatinine, abnormal kidney function, toxic nephropathy, edema, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and gum hyperplasia. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved significantly following cyclosporine withdrawal. Malignancies The incidence of malignancies in Study 3 [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.2) ] is presented in the table following. In Study 3, the incidence of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease was similar in all treatment groups. The overall incidence of malignancy was higher in patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine compared with patients who had cyclosporine withdrawn. Conclusions regarding these differences in the incidence of malignancy could not be made because Study 3 was not designed to consider malignancy risk factors or systematically screen subjects for malignancy. In addition, more patients in the sirolimus with cyclosporine group had a pretransplantation history of skin carcinoma. TABLE 3 INCIDENCE (%) OF MALIGNANCIES IN STUDY 3 (CYCLOSPORINE WITHDRAWAL STUDY) AT 36 MONTHS POST-TRANSPLANT a,b Malignancy Nonrandomized (n = 95) Sirolimus with Cyclosporine Therapy (n = 215) Sirolimus Following Cyclosporine Withdrawal (n = 215) a: Patients received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. b: Includes patients who prematurely discontinued treatment. c: Patients may be counted in more than one category.

Overall, the incidence and nature of adverse events was similar to those seen in previous combination studies with sirolimus. The incidence of malignancy was 1.3 % at 12 months. 6.4 Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitors to sirolimus in Maintenance Renal Transplant Population The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant population have not been established [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.4) ]. In a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus (initial target sirolimus concentrations of 12 to 20 ng/mL, and then 8 to 20 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients (n = 87) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min. There was a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death, in this stratum of the sirolimus treatment arm. The subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min had 2 years of follow-up after randomization. In this population, the rate of pneumonia was 15/58 vs. 4/29, graft loss (excluding death with functioning graft loss) was 13/58 vs. 9/29, and death was 9/58 vs. 1/29 in the sirolimus conversion group and CNI continuation group, respectively. In the subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of greater than 40 mL/min, there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the sirolimus conversion arm. Overall in this study, a 5-fold increase in the reports of tuberculosis among sirolimus (11/551) and comparator (1/273) treatment groups was observed with 2:1 randomization scheme. 6.5 Pediatric Renal Transplant Patients Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (< 18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.6) ]. The use of sirolimus in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections. 6.7 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sirolimus in transplant patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole – Lymphedema. Cardiovascular – Pericardial effusion (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults) and fluid accumulation. Digestive System – Ascites. Hematological/Lymphatic – The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.13) ]; pancytopenia, neutropenia. Hepatobiliary Disorders – Hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic necrosis, with elevated sirolimus trough concentrations. Immune System - Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4) ]. Infections – Tuberculosis. BK virus associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.10) ]. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis . Metabolic/Nutritional – Liver function test abnormal, AST/SGOT increased, ALT/SGPT increased, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus. Nervous system - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Respiratory – Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the sirolimus trough concentration increases [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.11) ]; pulmonary hemorrhage; pleural effusion; alveolar proteinosis. Skin – Exfoliative dermatitis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4) ]. Urogenital - Nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Azoospermia has been reported with the use of sirolimus and has been reversible upon discontinuation of sirolimus in most cases."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions ( 5.4) Angioedema ( 5.5) Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing ( 5.6) Hyperlipidemia ( 5.7) Renal Function ( 5.8) Proteinuria ( 5.9) Latents Viral Infections ( 5.10) Interstitial Lung Disease ( 5.11) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine ( 5.12) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-induced HUS/TTP/TMA ( 5.13) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7 to 3.2% (for Sirolimus-treated patients) versus 0.6 to 0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1) and ( 6.2) ]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use Sirolimus for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 5.2 Liver Transplantation - Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT) The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of sirolimus has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis (HAT). In a study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6 to 144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI-based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.5) ]. 5.3 Lung Transplantation – Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of sirolimus [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.7) ]. 5.5 Angioedema Sirolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of sirolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as ACE-inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving sirolimus, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1) ]. mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with sirolimus [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1) ]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m 2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving sirolimus. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with sirolimus compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.1) ]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43 to 46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45 to 57%) in patients receiving sirolimus compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including sirolimus. Any patient who is administered sirolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine or sirolimus after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels > 240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse events such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (< 1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of sirolimus on cardiovascular mortality. During sirolimus therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the coadministration of sirolimus with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and sirolimus were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving sirolimus and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of sirolimus and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients 6 to 120 months post-transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to sirolimus compared with CNI continuation [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.4) , ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.4) ]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio > 3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.7) ]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.7) ]. 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.6) ]. 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in transplant patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Different Sirolimus Trough Concentration Reported between Chromatographic and Immunoassay Methodologies Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.5) ]. 5.16 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 5.17 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Coadministration of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) is not recommended [see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7) ]."
