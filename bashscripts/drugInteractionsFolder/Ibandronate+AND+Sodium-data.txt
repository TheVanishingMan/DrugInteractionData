        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medications may interfere with absorption of ibandronate. Do not take within 60 minutes of dosing (7.1) Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation. (7.2) 7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of ibandronate sodium. Therefore, instruct patients to take ibandronate sodium at least 60 minutes before any oral medications, including medications containing multivalent cations (such as antacids, supplements or vitamins). Also, patients should wait at least 60 minutes after dosing before taking any other oral medications (see Dosage and Administration [2.3]). 7.2 Aspirin/Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Because aspirin, NSAIDs, and bisphosphonates are all associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of aspirin or NSAIDs with ibandronate sodium. 7.3 H2 Blockers In healthy volunteers, coadministration with ranitidine resulted in a 20% increased bioavailability of ibandronate, which was not considered to be clinically relevant (see Clinical Pharmacology [12.3]). 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents. Specific studies with ibandronate have not been performed."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 5%) are back pain, dyspepsia, pain in extremity, diarrhea, headache, and myalgia. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE, Inc. at 1-855-361-3993; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Treatment and Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Daily Dosing The safety of ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg once daily in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in 3577 patients aged 41 to 82 years. The duration of the trials was 2 to 3 years, with 1134 patients exposed to placebo and 1140 exposed to ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 23% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 17% in both the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and the placebo group. Table 1 lists adverse reactions from the treatment and prevention studies reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients and more frequently in patients treated daily with ibandronate sodium than patients treated with placebo. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence Greater Than or Equal to 2% and in More Patients Treated with Ibandronate Sodium Than in Patients Treated with Placebo Daily in the Osteoporosis Treatment and Prevention Studies Body System Placebo % (n=1134) Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg % (n=1140) Body as a Whole Back Pain 12 14 Pain in Extremity 6 8 Asthenia 2 4 Allergic Reaction 2 3 Digestive System Dyspepsia 10 12 Diarrhea 5 7 Tooth Disorder 2 4 Vomiting 2 3 Gastritis 2 2 Musculoskeletal System Myalgia 5 6 Joint Disorder 3 4 Arthritis 3 3 Nervous System Headache 6 7 Dizziness 3 4 Vertigo 3 3 Respiratory System Upper Respiratory Infection 33 34 Bronchitis 7 10 Pneumonia 4 6 Pharyngitis 2 3 Urogenital System 4 6 Urinary Tract Infection 4 6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the placebo and ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily groups were: dyspepsia (10% vs. 12%), diarrhea (5% vs. 7%), and abdominal pain (5% vs. 6%). Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected musculoskeletal adverse reactions in the placebo and ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily groups were: back pain (12% vs. 14%), arthralgia (14% vs. 14%) and myalgia (5% vs. 6%). Ocular Adverse Events Reports in the medical literature indicate that bisphosphonates may be associated with ocular inflammation such as iritis and scleritis. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued. There were no reports of ocular inflammation in studies with ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily. Monthly Dosing The safety of ibandronate sodium 150 mg once monthly in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a two year trial which enrolled 1583 patients aged 54 to 81 years, with 395 patients exposed to ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily and 396 exposed to ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly. Patients with active or significant pre-existing gastrointestinal disease were excluded from this trial. Patients with dyspepsia or concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in this study. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. After one year, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.3% in both the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and the ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and 7% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events was 9% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and 8% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly group. Table 2 lists the adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Events The incidence of adverse events in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily and ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly groups were: back pain (4% vs. 5%), arthralgia (4% vs. 6%) and myalgia (1% vs. 2%). Acute Phase Reactions Symptoms consistent with acute phase reactions have been reported with bisphosphonate use. Over the two years of the study, the overall incidence of acute phase reaction symptoms was 3% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and 9% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly group. These incidence rates are based on the reporting of any of 33 acute-phase reaction like symptoms within 3 days of the monthly dosing and lasting 7 days or less. Influenza like illness was reported in no patients in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and 2% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly group. Ocular Adverse Events Two patients who received ibandronate sodium 150 mg once-monthly experienced ocular inflammation, one was a case of uveitis and the other scleritis. One hundred sixty (160) postmenopausal women without osteoporosis participated in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ibandronate sodium 150 mg once-monthly for prevention of bone loss. Seventy-seven subjects received ibandronate sodium and 83 subjects received placebo. The overall pattern of adverse events was similar to that previously observed. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ibandronate sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity Allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction/shock; in some cases fatal, angioedema, bronchospasm, asthma exacerbations, and rash have been reported (see Contraindications [4] ). Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium (see Warnings and Precautions [5.2]). Musculoskeletal Pain Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating, has been reported (see Warnings and Precautions [5.3] ). Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium (see Warnings and Precautions [5.4] ). Atypical Femoral Shaft Fracture Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft (see Warnings and Precautions [5.5] )."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions and discontinue use if new or worsening symptoms occur. (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Correct hypocalcemia before use. (5.2) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Consider discontinuing use if symptoms develop. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. (5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. (5.5) 5.1 Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Ibandronate sodium, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when ibandronate sodium is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett’s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue ibandronate sodium and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient (see Dosage and Administration [2.2]). In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with ibandronate sodium should be used under appropriate supervision. There have been postmarketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium. Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ibandronate sodium therapy. Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate (see Dosage and Administration [2.3]). 5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium and other bisphosphonates (see Adverse Reactions [6]). The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop. 5.4 Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including ibandronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Severe Renal Impairment Ibandronate sodium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min)."

Quarterly Intravenous Injection – In a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing BONIVA Injection administered intravenously as 3 mg every 3 months to BONIVA 2.5 mg daily oral tablet in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the overall safety and tolerability profiles of the two dosing regimens were similar. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 8.0% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and 7.5% in the BONIVA Injection 3 mg once every 3 months group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 6.7% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and 8.5% in the BONIVA Injection 3 mg every 3 months group.

The overall incidence of patients with APR-like events was higher in the intravenous treatment group (4% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group vs. 10% in the BONIVA Injection 3 mg once every 3 months group). These incidence rates are based upon reporting of any of 33 potential APR-like symptoms within 3 days of an intravenous dose and lasting 7 days or less. In most cases, no specific treatment was required and the symptoms subsided within 24 to 48 hours. Injection Site Reactions Local reactions at the injection site, such as redness or swelling, were observed at a higher incidence in patients treated with BONIVA Injection 3 mg every 3 months (1.7%; 8/469) than in patients treated with placebo injections (0.2%; 1/465). In most cases, the reaction was of mild to moderate severity. Daily Oral Tablet - The safety of BONIVA 2.5 mg once daily in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in 3577 patients aged 41 – 82 years. The duration of the trials was 2 to 3 years, with 1134 patients exposed to placebo and 1140 exposed to BONIVA 2.5 mg. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 23% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypocalcemia can worsen. Correct hypocalcemia prior to use. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D (5.1) Anaphylaxis, including fatal events, has been reported. (5.2) Renal Toxicity may be greater in patients with underlying renal impairment. Do not administer BONIVA injection to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Monitor serum creatinine prior to each dose. (5.3) Tissue Damage with Inappropriate Drug Administration can occur. Do not administer BONIVA Injection intra-arterially or paravenously. (5.4) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported. (5.5) Severe Bone, Joint, and/or Muscle Pain may occur, consider discontinuing use if symptoms occur. (5.6) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. (5.7) 5.1 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism BONIVA Injection may cause a decrease in serum calcium values. Treat hypocalcemia, hypovitaminosis D, and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting BONIVA Injection therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. It is recommended that patients receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. 5.2 Anaphylactic Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with BONIVA Injection. Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available when BONIVA Injection is administered. If anaphylactic or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic reactions occur, immediately discontinue the injection and initiate appropriate treatment. 5.3 Renal Impairment Treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates has been associated with renal toxicity manifested as deterioration in renal function and acute renal failure. Although no cases of acute renal failure were observed in controlled clinical trials in which intravenous BONIVA was administered as a 15- to 30-second bolus, acute renal failure has been reported postmarketing. Do not administer BONIVA Injection to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Obtain serum creatinine prior to each BONIVA Injection. After BONIVA Injection, assess renal function, as clinically appropriate, in patients with concomitant diseases or taking medications that have the potential for adverse effects on the kidney. BONIVA Injection should be withheld in patients with renal deterioration. 5.4 Tissue Damage Related to Inappropriate Drug Administration BONIVA Injection must only be administered intravenously. Care must be taken not to administer BONIVA Injection intra-arterially or paravenously as this could lead to tissue damage. Do not administer BONIVA Injection by any other route of administration. The safety and efficacy of BONIVA Injection following non-intravenous routes of administration have not been established. 5.5 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including BONIVA Injection. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. Some cases have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with either oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. Consider a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.6 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking BONIVA and other bisphosphonates [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping the bisphosphonate. A subset of patients had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Discontinue BONIVA if severe symptoms develop. 5.7 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medications may interfere with absorption of ibandronate. Do not take within 60 minutes of dosing (7.1) Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation. (7.2) 7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of BONIVA. Therefore, instruct patients to take BONIVA at least 60 minutes before any oral medications, including medications containing multivalent cations (such as antacids, supplements or vitamins). Also, patients should wait at least 60 minutes after dosing before taking any other oral medications (see Dosage and Administration [2.3]). 7.2 Aspirin/Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Because aspirin, NSAIDs, and bisphosphonates are all associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of aspirin or NSAIDs with BONIVA. 7.3 H2 Blockers In healthy volunteers, co-administration with ranitidine resulted in a 20% increased bioavailability of ibandronate, which was not considered to be clinically relevant (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY [12.3]). 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents. Specific studies with ibandronate have not been performed."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 5%) are back pain, dyspepsia, pain in extremity, diarrhea, headache, and myalgia. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Treatment and Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Daily Dosing The safety of BONIVA 2.5 mg once daily in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in 3577 patients aged 41 – 82 years. The duration of the trials was 2 to 3 years, with 1134 patients exposed to placebo and 1140 exposed to BONIVA 2.5 mg. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 23% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 17% in both the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and the placebo group. Table 1 lists adverse reactions from the treatment and prevention studies reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients and more frequently in patients treated daily with BONIVA than patients treated with placebo. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence Greater Than or Equal to 2% and in More Patients Treated with BONIVA Than in Patients Treated with Placebo Daily in the Osteoporosis Treatment and Prevention Studies Body System Placebo % (n=1134) BONIVA 2.5 mg % (n=1140) Body as a Whole Back Pain 12 14 Pain in Extremity 6 8 Asthenia 2 4 Allergic Reaction 2 3 Digestive System Dyspepsia 10 12 Diarrhea 5 7 Tooth Disorder 2 4 Vomiting 2 3 Gastritis 2 2 Musculoskeletal System Myalgia 5 6 Joint Disorder 3 4 Arthritis 3 3 Nervous System Headache 6 7 Dizziness 3 4 Vertigo 3 3 Respiratory System Upper Respiratory Infection 33 34 Bronchitis 7 10 Pneumonia 4 6 Pharyngitis 2 3 Urogenital System Urinary Tract Infection 4 6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the placebo and BONIVA 2.5 mg daily groups were: dyspepsia (10% vs. 12%), diarrhea (5% vs. 7%), and abdominal pain (5% vs. 6%). Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected musculoskeletal adverse reactions in the placebo and BONIVA 2.5 mg daily groups were: back pain (12% vs. 14%), arthralgia (14% vs. 14%) and myalgia (5% vs. 6%). Ocular Adverse Events Reports in the medical literature indicate that bisphosphonates may be associated with ocular inflammation such as iritis and scleritis. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued. There were no reports of ocular inflammation in studies with BONIVA 2.5 mg daily. Monthly Dosing The safety of BONIVA 150 mg once monthly in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a two year trial which enrolled 1583 patients aged 54 – 81 years, with 395 patients exposed to BONIVA 2.5 mg daily and 396 exposed to BONIVA 150 mg monthly. Patients with active or significant pre-existing gastrointestinal disease were excluded from this trial. Patients with dyspepsia or concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in this study. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. After one year, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.3% in both the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and the BONIVA 150 mg monthly group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and 7% in the BONIVA 150 mg monthly group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events was 9% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and 8% in the BONIVA 150 mg monthly group. Table 2 lists the adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Events The incidence of adverse events in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily and BONIVA 150 mg monthly groups were: back pain (4% vs. 5%), arthralgia (4% vs. 6%) and myalgia (1% vs. 2%). Acute Phase Reactions Symptoms consistent with acute phase reactions have been reported with bisphosphonate use. Over the two years of the study, the overall incidence of acute phase reaction symptoms was 3% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and 9% in the BONIVA 150 mg monthly group. These incidence rates are based on the reporting of any of 33 acute-phase reaction like symptoms within 3 days of the monthly dosing and lasting 7 days or less. Influenza like illness was reported in no patients in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and 2% in the BONIVA 150 mg monthly group. Ocular Adverse Events Two patients who received BONIVA 150 mg once-monthly experienced ocular inflammation, one was a case of uveitis and the other scleritis. One hundred sixty (160) postmenopausal women without osteoporosis participated in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of BONIVA 150 mg once-monthly for prevention of bone loss. Seventy-seven subjects received BONIVA and 83 subjects received placebo. The overall pattern of adverse events was similar to that previously observed. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BONIVA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity Allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction/shock with fatalities, angioedema, bronchospasm, asthma exacerbations, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis bullous have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS [4] ). Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with BONIVA (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.2]). Musculoskeletal Pain Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating, has been reported (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.3] ). Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated with BONIVA (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.4] ). Atypical Femoral Shaft Fracture Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.5] )."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions and discontinue use if new or worsening symptoms occur. (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Correct hypocalcemia before use. (5.2) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Consider discontinuing use if symptoms develop. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. (5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. (5.5) 5.1 Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions BONIVA, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BONIVA is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue BONIVA and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6-8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.2]). In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BONIVA should be used under appropriate supervision. There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking BONIVA. Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting BONIVA therapy. Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.3]). 5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking BONIVA and other bisphosphonates (see ADVERSE REACTIONS [6]). The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop. 5.4 Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including BONIVA. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Severe Renal Impairment BONIVA is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min)."

Quarterly Intravenous Injection In a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing ibandronate sodium injection administered intravenously as 3 mg (ibandronate) every 3 months to ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the overall safety and tolerability profiles of the two dosing regimens were similar. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 8.0% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily group and 7.5% in the ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg (ibandronate) once every 3 months group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 6.7% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily group and 8.5% in the ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg (ibandronate) every 3 months group. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in greater than 2% of patients. Table 1 Adverse Reactions With an Incidence of at Least 2% in Patients Treated with Ibandronate Sodium Injection (3 mg [ibandronate] once every 3 months) or Ibandronate Daily Oral Tablet (2.5 mg) * Combination of abdominal pain and abdominal pain upper † Combination of influenza-like illness and acute phase reaction ‡ Combination of rash, rash pruritic, rash macular, dermatitis, dermatitis allergic, exanthema, erythema, rash papular, rash generalized, dermatitis medicamentosa, rash erythematous Body System/Adverse Reaction Ibandronate 2.5 mg Daily (Oral) % (n=465) Ibandronate Sodium Injection 3 mg (ibandronate) every 3 months (Intravenous) % (n=469) Infections and Infestations Influenza 8 5 Nasopharyngitis 6 3 Cystitis 3 2 Gastroenteritis 3 2 Urinary Tract Infection 3 3 Bronchitis 3 2 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 3 1 Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal Pain* 6 5 Dyspepsia 4 4 Nausea 4 2 Constipation 4 3 Diarrhea 2 3 Gastritis 2 2 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia 9 10 Back Pain 8 7 Localized Osteoarthritis 2 2 Pain in Extremity 2 3 Myalgia 1 3 Nervous System Disorders Dizziness 3 2 Headache 3 4 Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 3 1 Depression 2 1 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Influenza-like Illness† 1 5 Fatigue 1 3 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash‡ 3 2 Acute Phase Reaction-like Events Symptoms consistent with acute phase reaction (APR) have been reported with intravenous bisphosphonate use. The overall incidence of patients with APR-like events was higher in the intravenous treatment group (4% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group vs. 10% in the ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg (ibandronate) once every 3 months group). These incidence rates are based upon reporting of any of 33 potential APR-like symptoms within 3 days of an intravenous dose and lasting 7 days or less. In most cases, no specific treatment was required and the symptoms subsided within 24 to 48 hours. Injection Site Reactions Local reactions at the injection site, such as redness or swelling, were observed at a higher incidence in patients treated with ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg (ibandronate) every 3 months (1.7%; 8/469) than in patients treated with placebo injections (0.2%; 1/465). In most cases, the reaction was of mild to moderate severity. Daily Oral Tablet The safety of ibandronate 2.5 mg once daily in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in 3577 patients aged 41 – 82 years. The duration of the trials was 2 to 3 years, with 1134 patients exposed to placebo and 1140 exposed to ibandronate 2.5 mg. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 23% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 17% in both the placebo group and the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group. Table 2 lists adverse reactions from the Treatment and Prevention Studies reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients and in more patients treated with ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet than patients treated with placebo.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected musculoskeletal adverse reactions in the placebo and ibandronate 2.5 mg daily groups were: back pain (12% vs. 14%), arthralgia (14% vs. 14%) and myalgia (5% vs. 6%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ibandronate sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity: Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis with fatalities, angioedema, asthma exacerbation, bronchospasm, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis bullous [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Renal Toxicity: Acute renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: Osteonecrosis of the jaw [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Musculoskeletal Pain: Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Atypical Femoral Shaft Fracture: Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Eye Inflammation: Iritis and uveitis. In some cases with other bisphosphonates, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypocalcemia can worsen. Correct hypocalcemia prior to use. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D (5.1) Anaphylaxis, including fatal events, has been reported. (5.2) Renal Toxicity may be greater in patients with underlying renal impairment. Do not administer Ibandronate Sodium Injection to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Monitor serum creatinine prior to each dose. (5.3) Tissue Damage with Inappropriate Drug Administration can occur. Do not administer Ibandronate Sodium Injection intra-arterially or paravenously. (5.4) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported. (5.5) Severe Bone, Joint, and/or Muscle Pain may occur, consider discontinuing use if symptoms occur. (5.6) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. (5.7) 5.1 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Ibandronate sodium injection may cause a decrease in serum calcium values. Treat hypocalcemia, hypovitaminosis D, and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ibandronate sodium injection therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. It is recommended that patients receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. 5.2 Anaphylactic Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium injection. Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available when ibandronate sodium injection is administered. If anaphylactic or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic reactions occur, immediately discontinue the injection and initiate appropriate treatment. 5.3 Renal Impairment Treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates has been associated with renal toxicity manifested as deterioration in renal function and acute renal failure. Although no cases of acute renal failure were observed in controlled clinical trials in which intravenous ibandronate sodium was administered as a 15- to 30-second bolus, acute renal failure has been reported postmarketing. Do not administer ibandronate sodium injection to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Obtain serum creatinine prior to each ibandronate sodium injection. After ibandronate sodium injection, assess renal function, as clinically appropriate, in patients with concomitant diseases or taking medications that have the potential for adverse effects on the kidney. Ibandronate sodium injection should be withheld in patients with renal deterioration. 5.4 Tissue Damage Related to Inappropriate Drug Administration Ibandronate sodium injection must only be administered intravenously. Care must be taken not to administer ibandronate sodium injection intra-arterially or paravenously as this could lead to tissue damage. Do not administer ibandronate sodium injection by any other route of administration. The safety and efficacy of ibandronate sodium injection following non-intravenous routes of administration have not been established. 5.5 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including ibandronate sodium injection. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. Some cases have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with either oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. Consider a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium and other bisphosphonates [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping the bisphosphonate. A subset of patients had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Discontinue ibandronate sodium if severe symptoms develop. 5.7 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis."

Quarterly Intravenous Injection – In a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing ibandronate injection administered intravenously as 3 mg every 3 months to ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the overall safety and tolerability profiles of the two dosing regimens were similar. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 8% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily group and 7.5% in the ibandronate injection 3 mg once every 3 months group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 6.7% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily group and 8.5% in the ibandronate injection 3 mg every 3 months group. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in greater than 2% of patients.

The overall incidence of patients with APR-like events was higher in the intravenous treatment group (4% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group vs. 10% in the ibandronate injection 3 mg once every 3 months group). These incidence rates are based upon reporting of any of 33 potential APR-like symptoms within 3 days of an intravenous dose and lasting 7 days or less. In most cases, no specific treatment was required and the symptoms subsided within 24 to 48 hours. Injection Site Reactions Local reactions at the injection site, such as redness or swelling, were observed at a higher incidence in patients treated with ibandronate injection 3 mg every 3 months (1.7%; 8/469) than in patients treated with placebo injections (0.2%; 1/465). In most cases, the reaction was of mild to moderate severity. Daily Oral Tablet – The safety of ibandronate 2.5 mg once daily in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in 3577 patients aged 41 – 82 years. The duration of the trials was 2 to 3 years, with 1134 patients exposed to placebo and 1140 exposed to ibandronate 2.5 mg. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 23% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 17% in both the placebo group and the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group. Table 2 lists adverse reactions from the Treatment and Prevention Studies reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients and in more patients treated with ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet than patients treated with placebo.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected musculoskeletal adverse reactions in the placebo and ibandronate 2.5 mg daily groups were: back pain (12% vs. 14%), arthralgia (14% vs. 14%) and myalgia (5% vs. 6%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ibandronate injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity: Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis with fatalities, angioedema, asthma exacerbation, bronchospasm, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis bullous [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Renal Toxicity: Acute renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: Osteonecrosis of the jaw [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Musculoskeletal Pain: Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Atypical Femoral Shaft Fracture: Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Eye Inflammation: Iritis and uveitis. In some cases with other bisphosphonates, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypocalcemia can worsen. Correct hypocalcemia prior to use. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D (5.1) • Anaphylaxis, including fatal events, has been reported. (5.2) •Renal Toxicity may be greater in patients with underlying renal impairment. Do not administer ibandronate injection to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Monitor serum creatinine prior to each dose. (5.3) • Tissue Damage with Inappropriate Drug Administration can occur. Do not administer ibandronate injection intra-arterially or paravenously. (5.4) • Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported. (5.5) •Severe Bone, Joint, and/or Muscle Pain may occur, consider discontinuing use if symptoms occur. (5.6) • Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. (5.7) 5.1 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Ibandronate injection may cause a decrease in serum calcium values. Treat hypocalcemia, hypovitaminosis D, and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ibandronate injection therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. It is recommended that patients receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. 5.2 Anaphylactic Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with ibandronate injection. Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available when ibandronate injection is administered. If anaphylactic or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic reactions occur, immediately discontinue the injection and initiate appropriate treatment. 5.3Renal Impairment Treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates has been associated with renal toxicity manifested as deterioration in renal function and acute renal failure. Although no cases of acute renal failure were observed in controlled clinical trials in which intravenous ibandronate was administered as a 15 to 30 second bolus, acute renal failure has been reported postmarketing. Do not administer ibandronate injection to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Obtain serum creatinine prior to each ibandronate injection. After ibandronate injection, assess renal function, as clinically appropriate, in patients with concomitant diseases or taking medications that have the potential for adverse effects on the kidney. Ibandronate injection should be withheld in patients with renal deterioration. 5.4 Tissue Damage Related to Inappropriate Drug Administration Ibandronate injection must only be administered intravenously. Care must be taken not to administer ibandronate injection intra-arterially or paravenously as this could lead to tissue damage. Do not administer ibandronate injection by any other route of administration. The safety and efficacy of ibandronate injection following non-intravenous routes of administration have not been established. 5.5 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including ibandronate injection. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. Some cases have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with either oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. Consider a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking ibandronate and other bisphosphonates [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping the bisphosphonate. A subset of patients had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Discontinue ibandronate if severe symptoms develop. 5.7 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis."

Treatment and Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Monthly Dosing The safety of ibandronate sodium 150 mg as ibandronic acid once monthly in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a two year trial which enrolled 1583 patients aged 54 to 81 years, with 395 patients exposed to ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg as ibandronic acid daily and 396 exposed to ibandronate sodium 150 mg as ibandronic acid monthly. Patients with active or significant pre-existing gastrointestinal disease were excluded from this trial. Patients with dyspepsia or concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in this study. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. After one year, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.3% in both the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg as ibandronic acid daily group and the ibandronate sodium 150 mg as ibandronic acid monthly group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg as ibandronic acid daily group and 7% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg as ibandronic acid monthly group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events was 9% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg as ibandronic acid daily group and 8% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg as ibandronic acid monthly group. Table 1 lists the adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Events The incidence of adverse events in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg as ibandronic acid daily and ibandronate sodium 150 mg as ibandronic acid monthly groups were: back pain (4% vs. 5%), arthralgia (4% vs. 6%) and myalgia (1% vs. 2%). Acute Phase Reactions Symptoms consistent with acute phase reactions have been reported with bisphosphonate use. Over the two years of the study, the overall incidence of acute phase reaction symptoms was 3% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg as ibandronic acid daily group and 9% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg as ibandronic acid monthly group. These incidence rates are based on the reporting of any of 33 acute-phase reaction like symptoms within 3 days of the monthly dosing and lasting 7 days or less. Influenza like illness was reported in no patients in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg as ibandronic acid daily group and 2% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg as ibandronic acid monthly group. Ocular Adverse Events Two patients who received ibandronate sodium 150 mg as ibandronic acid once-monthly experienced ocular inflammation, one was a case of uveitis and the other scleritis. One hundred sixty (160) postmenopausal women without osteoporosis participated in a 1 year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ibandronate sodium 150 mg as ibandronic acid once-monthly for prevention of bone loss. Seventy-seven subjects received ibandronate sodium and 83 subjects received placebo. The overall pattern of adverse events was similar to that previously observed. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ibandronate sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity Allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction/shock; in some cases fatal, angioedema, bronchospasm, asthma exacerbations, and rash have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS [4]). Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.2]). Musculoskeletal Pain Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating, has been reported (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.3]). Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.4]). Atypical Femoral Shaft Fracture Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.5])."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Upper gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions and discontinue use if new or worsening symptoms occur. (5.1) • Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Correct hypocalcemia before use. (5.2) • Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Consider discontinuing use if symptoms develop. (5.3) • Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. (5.4) • Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. (5.5) 5.1 Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Ibandronate sodium, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause loca lirritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when ibandronate sodium is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett’s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue ibandronate sodium and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.2]). In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with ibandronate sodium should be used under appropriate supervision. There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium. Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ibandronate sodium therapy. Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.3]). 5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium and other bisphosphonates (see ADVERSEREACTIONS [6]). The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop. 5.4 Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including ibandronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy,corticosteroids), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures).The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area,usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb.Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Severe Renal Impairment Ibandronate sodium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min)."

Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected musculoskeletal adverse reactions in the placebo and ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily groups were: back pain (12% vs. 14%), arthralgia (14% vs. 14%) and myalgia (5% vs. 6%). Ocular Adverse Events Reports in the medical literature indicate that bisphosphonates may be associated with ocular inflammation such as iritis and scleritis. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued. There were no reports of ocular inflammation in studies with ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily. Monthly Dosing The safety of ibandronate sodium 150 mg once monthly in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a two year trial which enrolled 1583 patients aged 54 to 81 years, with 395 patients exposed to ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily and 396 exposed to ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly. Patients with active or significant pre-existing gastrointestinal disease were excluded from this trial. Patients with dyspepsia or concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in this study. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. After one year, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.3% in both the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and the ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and 7% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events was 9% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and 8% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly group. Table 2 lists the adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Events The incidence of adverse events in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily and ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly groups were: back pain (4% vs. 5%), arthralgia (4% vs. 6%) and myalgia (1% vs. 2%). Acute Phase Reactions Symptoms consistent with acute phase reactions have been reported with bisphosphonate use. Over the two years of the study, the overall incidence of acute phase reaction symptoms was 3% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and 9% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly group. These incidence rates are based on the reporting of any of 33 acute-phase reaction like symptoms within 3 days of the monthly dosing and lasting 7 days or less. Influenza like illness was reported in no patients in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily group and 2% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg monthly group. Ocular Adverse Events Two patients who received ibandronate sodium 150 mg once-monthly experienced ocular inflammation, one was a case of uveitis and the other scleritis. One hundred sixty (160) postmenopausal women without osteoporosis participated in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ibandronate sodium 150 mg once-monthly for prevention of bone loss. Seventy-seven subjects received ibandronate sodium and 83 subjects received placebo. The overall pattern of adverse events was similar to that previously observed. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ibandronate sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity Allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction/shock; in some cases fatal, angioedema, bronchospasm, asthma exacerbations, and rash have been reported (see Contraindications [4] ). Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium (see Warnings and Precautions [5.2]). Musculoskeletal Pain Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating, has been reported (see Warnings and Precautions [5.3] ). Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium (see Warnings and Precautions [5.4] ). Atypical Femoral Shaft Fracture Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft (see Warnings and Precautions [5.5] )."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions and discontinue use if new or worsening symptoms occur. (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Correct hypocalcemia before use. (5.2) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Consider discontinuing use if symptoms develop. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. (5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. (5.5) 5.1 Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Ibandronate sodium, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when ibandronate sodium is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett’s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue ibandronate sodium and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient (see Dosage and Administration [2.2]). In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with ibandronate sodium should be used under appropriate supervision. There have been postmarketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium. Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ibandronate sodium therapy. Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate (see Dosage and Administration [2.3]). 5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium and other bisphosphonates (see Adverse Reactions [6]). The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop. 5.4 Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including ibandronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Severe Renal Impairment Ibandronate sodium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min)."

Quarterly Intravenous Injection – In a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing ibandronate sodium injection administered intravenously as 3 mg every 3 months to ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily oral tablet in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the overall safety and tolerability profiles of the two dosing regimens were similar. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 8% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily group and 7.5% in the ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg once every 3 months group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 6.7% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily group and 8.5% in the ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg every 3 months group. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in greater than 2% of patients.

The overall incidence of patients with APR-like events was higher in the intravenous treatment group (4% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily oral tablet group vs. 10% in the ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg once every 3 months group). These incidence rates are based upon reporting of any of 33 potential APR-like symptoms within 3 days of an intravenous dose and lasting 7 days or less. In most cases, no specific treatment was required and the symptoms subsided within 24 to 48 hours. Injection Site Reactions Local reactions at the injection site, such as redness or swelling, were observed at a higher incidence in patients treated with ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg every 3 months (1.7%; 8/469) than in patients treated with placebo injections (0.2%; 1/465). In most cases, the reaction was of mild to moderate severity. Daily Oral Tablet - The safety of ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) once daily in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in 3,577 patients aged 41 to 82 years. The duration of the trials was 2 to 3 years, with 1,134 patients exposed to placebo and 1,140 exposed to ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate). Patients with preexisting gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 23% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily oral tablet group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 17% in both the placebo group and the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily oral tablet group.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypocalcemia can worsen. Correct hypocalcemia prior to use. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D (5.1) Anaphylaxis, including fatal events, has been reported. (5.2) Renal Toxicity may be greater in patients with underlying renal impairment. Do not administer ibandronate sodium injection to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Monitor serum creatinine prior to each dose. (5.3) Tissue Damage with Inappropriate Drug Administration can occur. Do not administer ibandronate sodium injection intra-arterially or paravenously. (5.4) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported. (5.5) Severe Bone, Joint, and/or Muscle Pain may occur, consider discontinuing use if symptoms occur. (5.6) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. (5.7) 5.1 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Ibandronate sodium injection may cause a decrease in serum calcium values. Treat hypocalcemia, hypovitaminosis D, and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ibandronate sodium injection therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. It is recommended that patients receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. 5.2 Anaphylactic Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium injection. Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available when ibandronate sodium injection is administered. If anaphylactic or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic reactions occur, immediately discontinue the injection and initiate appropriate treatment. 5.3 Renal Impairment Treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates has been associated with renal toxicity manifested as deterioration in renal function and acute renal failure. Although no cases of acute renal failure were observed in controlled clinical trials in which intravenous ibandronate sodium was administered as a 15- to 30-second bolus, acute renal failure has been reported postmarketing. Do not administer ibandronate sodium injection to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Obtain serum creatinine prior to each ibandronate sodium injection. After ibandronate sodium injection, assess renal function, as clinically appropriate, in patients with concomitant diseases or taking medications that have the potential for adverse effects on the kidney. Ibandronate sodium injection should be withheld in patients with renal deterioration. 5.4 Tissue Damage Related to Inappropriate Drug Administration Ibandronate sodium injection must only be administered intravenously. Care must be taken not to administer ibandronate sodium injection intra-arterially or paravenously as this could lead to tissue damage. Do not administer ibandronate sodium injection by any other route of administration. The safety and efficacy of ibandronate sodium injection following non-intravenous routes of administration have not been established. 5.5 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including ibandronate sodium injection. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. Some cases have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with either oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. Consider a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium injection and other bisphosphonates [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping the bisphosphonate. A subset of patients had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Discontinue ibandronate sodium injection if severe symptoms develop. 5.7 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Events The incidence of adverse events in the placebo and BONIVA 2.5 mg daily groups were: back pain (12% vs. 14%), arthralgia (14% vs. 14%) and myalgia (5% vs. 6%). Ocular Adverse Events Reports in the medical literature indicate that bisphosphonates may be associated with ocular inflammation such as iritis and scleritis. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued. There were no reports of ocular inflammation in studies with BONIVA 2.5 mg daily. Monthly Dosing The safety of BONIVA 150 mg once monthly in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a two year trial which enrolled 1583 patients aged 54 – 81 years, with 395 patients exposed to BONIVA 2.5 mg daily and 396 exposed to BONIVA 150 mg monthly. Patients with active or significant pre-existing gastrointestinal disease were excluded from this trial. Patients with dyspepsia or concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in this study. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily. After one year, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.3% in both the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and the BONIVA 150 mg monthly group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and 7% in the BONIVA 150 mg monthly group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events was 9% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and 8% in the BONIVA 150 mg monthly group.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Events The incidence of adverse events in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily and BONIVA 150 mg monthly groups were: back pain (4% vs. 5%), arthralgia (4% vs. 6%) and myalgia (1% vs. 2%). Acute Phase Reactions Symptoms consistent with acute phase reactions have been reported with bisphosphonate use. Over the two years of the study, the overall incidence of acute phase reaction symptoms was 3% in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and 9% in the BONIVA 150 mg monthly group. These incidence rates are based on the reporting of any of 33 acute-phase reaction like symptoms within 3 days of the monthly dosing and lasting 7 days or less. Influenza like illness was reported in no patients in the BONIVA 2.5 mg daily group and 2% in the BONIVA 150 mg monthly group. Ocular Adverse Events Two patients who received BONIVA 150 mg once-monthly experienced ocular inflammation, one was a case of uveitis and the other scleritis. One hundred sixty (160) postmenopausal women without osteoporosis participated in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of BONIVA 150 mg once-monthly for prevention of bone loss. Seventy-seven subjects received BONIVA and 83 subjects received placebo. The overall pattern of adverse events was similar to that previously observed. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BONIVA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm and rash have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS [4] ). Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with BONIVA (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.2]). Musculoskeletal Pain Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating, has been reported (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.3] ). Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated with BONIVA (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.4] )."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Enter section text here Severe irritation of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa can occur. Dosing instructions should be followed and caution should be used in patients with active upper GI disease. Discontinue use if new or worsening symptoms occur. (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Correct hypocalcemia before use. (5.2) Severe bone, joint, and muscle pain may occur. Consider discontinuing use if symptoms develop. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported. (5.4) 5.1 Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions BONIVA, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BONIVA is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue BONIVA and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6-8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.2]). In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BONIVA should be used under appropriate supervision. There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolsim Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting BONIVA therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients to prevent hypocalcemia (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.3]). Hypocalcemia following dosing has been reported postmarketing. 5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking BONIVA and other bisphosphonates (see ADVERSE REACTIONS [6]). The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop. 5.4 Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis, primarily in the jaw, has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates. Most cases have been in cancer patients undergoing dental procedures, but some have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis or other diagnoses. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis include a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids), and co-morbid disorders (e.g., anemia, coagulopathy, infection, pre-existing dental disease). Most reported cases have been in patients treated with bisphosphonates intravenously but some have been in patients treated orally (see ADVERSE REACTIONS [6.2]). For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Severe Renal Impairment BONIVA is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min)."

Do not take within 60 minutes of dosing (7.1) Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation. (7.2) 7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of ibandronate sodium tablets. Therefore, instruct patients to take ibandronate sodium tablets at least 60 minutes before any oral medications, including medications containing multivalent cations (such as antacids, supplements or vitamins). Also, patients should wait at least 60 minutes after dosing before taking any other oral medications(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.3] ). 7.2 Aspirin/Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Because aspirin, NSAIDs, and bisphosphonates are all associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of aspirin or NSAIDs with ibandronate sodium tablets. 7.3 H2 Blockers In healthy volunteers, co-administration with ranitidine resulted in a 20% increased bioavailability of ibandronate, which was not considered to be clinically relevant (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY [12.3]). 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow Dosing instructions and Discontinue use if new or worsening symptoms occur. (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Correct hypocalcemia before use. (5.2) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Consider discontinuing use if symptoms develop. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. (5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture.(5.5) 5.1 Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Ibandronate sodium tablets, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when ibandronate sodium tablets are given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue ibandronate sodium tablets and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.2] ). In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with ibandronate sodium tablets should be used under appropriate supervision. There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium tablets. Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ibandronate sodium tablets therapy. Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION [2.3]). 5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium tablets and other bisphosphonates (see ADVERSE REACTIONS [6]). The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop. 5.4 Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including ibandronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Severe Renal Impairment Ibandronate sodium tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min).",

Quarterly Intravenous Injection – In a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing ibandronate sodium injection administered intravenously as 3 mg every 3 months to ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the overall safety and tolerability profiles of the two dosing regimens were similar. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 8% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily group and 7.5% in the ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg once every 3 months group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 6.7% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily group and 8.5% in the ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg every 3 months group. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in greater than 2% of patients.

The overall incidence of patients with APR-like events was higher in the intravenous treatment group (4% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group vs. 10% in the ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg once every 3 months group). These incidence rates are based upon reporting of any of 33 potential APR-like symptoms within 3 days of an intravenous dose and lasting 7 days or less. In most cases, no specific treatment was required and the symptoms subsided within 24 to 48 hours. Injection Site Reactions Local reactions at the injection site, such as redness or swelling, were observed at a higher incidence in patients treated with ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg every 3 months (1.7%; 8/469) than in patients treated with placebo injections (0.2%; 1/465). In most cases, the reaction was of mild to moderate severity. Daily Oral Tablet - The safety of ibandronate 2.5 mg once daily in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in 3577 patients aged 41 to 82 years. The duration of the trials was 2 to 3 years, with 1134 patients exposed to placebo and 1140 exposed to ibandronate 2.5 mg. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 23% in the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 17% in both the placebo group and the ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group. Table 2 lists adverse reactions from the Treatment and Prevention Studies reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients and in more patients treated with ibandronate 2.5 mg daily oral tablet than patients treated with placebo.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected musculoskeletal adverse reactions in the placebo and ibandronate 2.5 mg daily groups were: back pain (12% vs. 14%), arthralgia (14% vs. 14%) and myalgia (5% vs. 6%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ibandronate sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity: Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis with fatalities, angioedema, asthma exacerbation, bronchospasm, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis bullous [ see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Renal Toxicity: Acute renal failure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: Osteonecrosis of the jaw [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Musculoskeletal Pain: Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Atypical Femoral Shaft Fracture: Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Eye Inflammation: Iritis and uveitis. In some cases with other bisphosphonates, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypocalcemia can worsen. Correct hypocalcemia prior to use. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D (5.1) Anaphylaxis, including fatal events, has been reported. (5.2) Renal Toxicity may be greater in patients with underlying renal impairment. Do not administer ibandronate sodium injection to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Monitor serum creatinine prior to each dose. (5.3) Tissue Damage with Inappropriate Drug Administration can occur. Do not administer ibandronate sodium injection intra-arterially or paravenously. (5.4) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported. (5.5) Severe Bone, Joint, and/or Muscle Pain may occur, consider discontinuing use if symptoms occur. (5.6) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. (5.7) 5.1 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Ibandronate sodium injection may cause a decrease in serum calcium values. Treat hypocalcemia, hypovitaminosis D, and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ibandronate sodium injection therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients. It is recommended that patients receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. 5.2 Anaphylactic Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium injection. Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available when ibandronate sodium injection is administered. If anaphylactic or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic reactions occur, immediately discontinue the injection and initiate appropriate treatment. 5.3 Renal Impairment Treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates has been associated with renal toxicity manifested as deterioration in renal function and acute renal failure. Although no cases of acute renal failure were observed in controlled clinical trials in which intravenous ibandronate was administered as a 15- to 30-second bolus, acute renal failure has been reported postmarketing. Do not administer ibandronate sodium injection to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). Obtain serum creatinine prior to each ibandronate sodium injection. After ibandronate sodium injection, assess renal function, as clinically appropriate, in patients with concomitant diseases or taking medications that have the potential for adverse effects on the kidney. Ibandronate sodium injection should be withheld in patients with renal deterioration. 5.4 Tissue Damage Related to Inappropriate Drug Administration Ibandronate sodium injection must only be administered intravenously. Care must be taken not to administer ibandronate sodium injection intra-arterially or paravenously as this could lead to tissue damage. Do not administer ibandronate sodium injection by any other route of administration. The safety and efficacy of ibandronate sodium injection following non-intravenous routes of administration have not been established. 5.5 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates, including ibandronate sodium injection. Most cases have been in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates undergoing dental procedures. Some cases have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with either oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of bisphosphonate treatment. Consider a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with a history of concomitant risk factors (e.g., cancer, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, coagulopathy). Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. While on treatment, patients with concomitant risk factors should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. The clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking ibandronate and other bisphosphonates [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping the bisphosphonate. A subset of patients had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Discontinue ibandronate if severe symptoms develop. 5.7 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medications may interfere with absorption of ibandronate. Do not take within 60 minutes of dosing (7.1) Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation. (7.2) 7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of ibandronate sodium. Therefore, instruct patients to take ibandronate sodium at least 60 minutes before any oral medications, including medications containing multivalent cations (such as antacids, supplements or vitamins). Also, patients should wait at least 60 minutes after dosing before taking any other oral medications (see Dosage and Administration [ 2.3 ]). 7.2 Aspirin/Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Because aspirin, NSAIDs, and bisphosphonates are all associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of aspirin or NSAIDs with ibandronate. 7.3 H2 Blockers In healthy volunteers, co-administration with ranitidine resulted in a 20% increased bioavailability of ibandronate, which was not considered to be clinically relevant (see Clinical Pharmacology [12.3]). 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents. Specific studies with ibandronate have not been performed."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 5%) are back pain, dyspepsia, pain in extremity, diarrhea, headache, and myalgia. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Treatment and Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Monthly Dosing The safety of ibandronate sodium 150 mg (acid) once monthly in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a two year trial which enrolled 1583 patients aged 54 to 81 years, with 395 patients exposed to ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg (acid) daily and 396 exposed to ibandronate sodium 150 mg (acid) monthly. Patients with active or significant pre-existing gastrointestinal disease were excluded from this trial. Patients with dyspepsia or concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in this study. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. After one year, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.3% in both the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg (acid) daily group and the ibandronate sodium 150 mg (acid) monthly group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg (acid) daily group and 7% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg (acid) monthly group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events was 9% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg (acid) daily group and 8% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg (acid) monthly group. Table 1 lists the adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Events The incidence of adverse events in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg (acid) daily and ibandronate sodium 150 mg (acid) monthly groups were: back pain (4% vs. 5%), arthralgia (4% vs. 6%) and myalgia (1% vs. 2%). Acute Phase Reactions Symptoms consistent with acute phase reactions have been reported with bisphosphonate use. Over the two years of the study, the overall incidence of acute phase reaction symptoms was 3% in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg (acid) daily group and 9% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg (acid) monthly group. These incidence rates are based on the reporting of any of 33 acute-phase reaction like symptoms within 3 days of the monthly dosing and lasting 7 days or less. Influenza like illness was reported in no patients in the ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg (acid) daily group and 2% in the ibandronate sodium 150 mg (acid) monthly group. Ocular Adverse Events Two patients who received ibandronate sodium 150 mg (acid) once-monthly experienced ocular inflammation, one was a case of uveitis and the other scleritis. One hundred sixty (160) postmenopausal women without osteoporosis participated in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ibandronate sodium 150 mg (acid) once-monthly for prevention of bone loss. Seventy-seven subjects received ibandronate sodium and 83 subjects received placebo. The overall pattern of adverse events was similar to that previously observed. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ibandronate sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity Allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction/shock; with fatalities, angioedema, bronchospasm, asthma exacerbations,rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema muliforme, and dermatitis bullous have been reported (see Contraindications [4]) Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium (see Warnings and Precautions [5.2]). Musculoskeletal Pain Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating, has been reported (see Warnings and Precautions [5.3] ). Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium (see Warnings and Precautions [5.4] ). Atypical Femoral Shaft Fracture Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft (see Warnings and Precautions [5.5] )."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions and discontinue use if new or worsening symptoms occur. (5.1) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Correct hypocalcemia before use. (5.2) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Consider discontinuing use if symptoms develop. (5.3) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. (5.4) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. (5.5) 5.1 Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Ibandronate sodium, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when ibandronate sodium is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett’s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue ibandronate sodium and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient (see Dosage and Administration [2.2] ). In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with ibandronate sodium should be used under appropriate supervision. There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium. Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ibandronate sodium therapy. Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate. (see Dosage and Administration [2.3] ). 5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium and other bisphosphonates (see Adverse Reactions [6] ). The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop. 5.4 Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including ibandronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Severe Renal Impairment Ibandronate sodium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min)."
