        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS It is recommended that appropriate references be consulted regarding physical or chemical incompatibilities before adding HYLENEX recombinant to a solution containing another drug. Furosemide, the benzodiazepines and phenytoin are incompatible with hyaluronidase. (7.1) Hyaluronidase should not be used to enhance the dispersion and absorption of dopamine and/or alpha agonist drugs. (7.2) Local anesthetics: Hyaluronidase hastens onset and shortens duration of effect, increases incidence of systemic reactions. (7.3) Large doses of salicylates, cortisone, ACTH, estrogens or antihistamines may require larger amounts of hyaluronidase for equivalent dispersing effect. (7.4) 7.1 Incompatibilities Furosemide, the benzodiazepines and phenytoin have been found to be incompatible with hyaluronidase. 7.2 Drug-Specific Precautions Hyaluronidase should not be used to enhance the dispersion and absorption of dopamine and/or alpha agonist drugs. When considering the administration of any other drug with hyaluronidase, it is recommended that appropriate references first be consulted to determine the usual precautions for the use of the other drug. 7.3 Local Anesthetics When hyaluronidase is added to a local anesthetic agent, it hastens the onset of analgesia and tends to reduce the swelling caused by local infiltration, but the wider spread of the local anesthetic solution increases its absorption; this shortens its duration of action and tends to increase the incidence of systemic reaction. 7.4 Salicylates, Cortisone, ACTH, Estrogens and Antihistamines Patients receiving large doses of salicylates, cortisone, ACTH, estrogens or antihistamines may require larger amounts of hyaluronidase for equivalent dispersing effect, since these drugs apparently render tissues partly resistant to the action of hyaluronidase."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequently reported adverse reactions have been mild local injection site reactions such as erythema and pain. Hyaluronidase has been reported to enhance the adverse reactions associated with co-administered drug products. Edema has been reported most frequently in association with subcutaneous fluid administration. Allergic reactions (urticaria or angioedema) have been reported in less than 0.1% of patients receiving hyaluronidase. Anaphylactic-like reactions following retrobulbar block or intravenous injections have occurred, rarely. Allergic and anaphylactic-like reactions have been reported, rarely.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Spread of Localized Infection (5.1) Ocular Damage (5.2) Enzyme Inactivation with Intravenous Administration (5.3) Products Containing Plasma-derived Albumin (5.4) 5.1 Spread of Localized Infection Hyaluronidase should not be injected into or around an infected or acutely inflamed area because of the danger of spreading a localized infection. Hyaluronidase should not be used to reduce the swelling of bites or stings. 5.2 Ocular Damage Hyaluronidase should not be applied directly to the cornea. It is not for topical use. 5.3 Enzyme Inactivation with Intravenous Administration HYLENEX recombinant should not be administered intravenously. Its effects relative to dispersion and absorption of other drugs are not produced when it is administered intravenously because the enzyme is rapidly inactivated. 5.4 Products Containing Plasma-derived Albumin This product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). There is a theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), but if that risk actually exists, the risk of transmission would also be considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases, CJD, or vCJD have ever been identified for licensed albumin or albumin contained in other licensed products."
