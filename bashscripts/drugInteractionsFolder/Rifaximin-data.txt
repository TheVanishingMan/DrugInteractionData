        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effects of rifaximin on cytochrome P450 enzymes studies have shown that rifaximin did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and CYP3A4 at concentrations ranging from 2 to 200 ng/mL . Rifaximin is not expected to inhibit these enzymes in clinical use. In vitro [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] An study has suggested that rifaximin induces CYP3A4 . However, in patients with normal liver function, rifaximin at the recommended dosing regimen is not expected to induce CYP3A4. It is unknown whether rifaximin can have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of concomitant CYP3A4 substrates in patients with reduced liver function who have elevated rifaximin concentrations. in vitro [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 7.2 Concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitors An study suggested that rifaximin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein. Co-administration of cyclosporine, a potent P-glycoprotein inhibitor, with rifaximin resulted in 83-fold and 124-fold increases in rifaximin mean C and AUC∞ in healthy subjects. The clinical significance of this increase in systemic exposure is unknown . in vitro max [see Clinical Pharmacology ( )] 12.3"

Travelers' Diarrhea The safety of XIFAXAN 200 mg taken three times a day was evaluated in patients with travelers' diarrhea consisting of 320 patients in two placebo-controlled clinical trials with 95% of patients receiving three or four days of treatment with XIFAXAN. The population studied had a mean age of 31.3 (18-79) years of which approximately 3% were >= 65 years old, 53% were male and 84% were White, 11% were Hispanic. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were taste loss, dysentery, weight decrease, anorexia, nausea and nasal passage irritation. All adverse reactions for XIFAXAN 200 mg three times daily that occurred at a frequency >= 2% in the two placebo-controlled trials combined are provided in Table 1. (These include adverse reactions that may be attributable to the underlying disease.) Table 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effects of XIFAXAN on Other Drugs Substrates of Cytochrome P450 enzymes Rifaximin is not expected to inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and CYP3A4 in clinical use based on in vitro studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. An in vitro study has suggested that rifaximin induces CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. However, in patients with normal liver function, XIFAXAN at the recommended dosing regimen is not expected to induce CYP3A4. It is unknown whether rifaximin can have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of concomitant CYP3A4 substrates in patients with reduced liver function who have elevated rifaximin concentrations. 7.2 Effects of Other Drugs on XIFAXAN In vitro studies suggested that rifaximin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, OATP1A2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Concomitant cyclosporine, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and OATPs, significantly increased the systemic exposure to rifaximin. Cyclosporine Co-administration of cyclosporine, with XIFAXAN resulted in 83-fold and 124-fold increases in rifaximin mean Cmax and AUC∞ in healthy subjects. The clinical significance of this increase in systemic exposure is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions: -TD (>=2%): Headache (6.1) -HE (>=10%): Peripheral edema, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and ascites (6.1) -IBS-D (>=2%): ALT increased, nausea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Salix Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-508-0024 and www.Salix.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Travelers' Diarrhea The safety of XIFAXAN 200 mg taken three times a day was evaluated in patients with travelers' diarrhea consisting of 320 patients in two placebo-controlled clinical trials with 95% of patients receiving three or four days of treatment with XIFAXAN. The population studied had a mean age of 31.3 (18-79) years of which approximately 3% were >=65 years old, 53% were male and 84% were White, 11% were Hispanic. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were taste loss, dysentery, weight decrease, anorexia, nausea and nasal passage irritation. The adverse reaction that occurred at a frequency >=2% in XIFAXAN-treated patients (n=320) at a higher rate than placebo (n=228) in the two placebo-controlled trials of TD was: -headache (10% XIFAXAN, 9% placebo) Hepatic Encephalopathy The data described below reflect exposure to XIFAXAN in 348 patients, including 265 exposed for 6 months and 202 exposed for more than a year (mean exposure was 364 days). The safety of XIFAXAN 550 mg taken two times a day for reducing the risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in adult patients was evaluated in a 6-month placebo-controlled clinical trial (n=140) and in a long term follow-up study (n=280). The population studied had a mean age of 56 (range: 21 to 82) years; approximately 20% of the patients were >=65 years old, 61% were male, 86% were White, and 4% were Black. Ninety-one percent of patients in the trial were taking lactulose concomitantly. The most common adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence >=5% and at a higher incidence in XIFAXAN-treated subjects than in the placebo group in the 6-month trial are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Most Common Adverse Reactionsreported in >=5% of Patients Receiving XIFAXAN and at a higher incidence than placebo in HE Trial Number (%) of Patients MedDRA Preferred Term XIFAXAN Tablets 550 mg TWICE DAILY n=140 Placebo n=159 Peripheral edema 21 (15%) 13 (8%) Nausea 20 (14%) 21 (13%) Dizziness 18 (13%) 13 (8%) Fatigue 17 (12%) 18 (11%) Ascites 16 (11%) 15 (9%) Muscle spasms 13 (9%) 11 (7%) Pruritus 13 (9%) 10 (6%) Abdominal pain 12 (9%) 13 (8%) Anemia 11 (8%) 6 (4%) Depression 10 (7%) 8 (5%) Nasopharyngitis 10 (7%) 10 (6%) Abdominal pain upper 9 (6%) 8 (5%) Arthralgia 9 (6%) 4 (3%) Dyspnea 9 (6%) 7 (4%) Pyrexia 9 (6%) 5 (3%) Rash 7 (5%) 6 (4%) Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Diarrhea The safety of XIFAXAN for the treatment of IBS-D was evaluated in 3 placebo-controlled studies in which 952 patients were randomized to XIFAXAN 550 mg three times a day for 14 days. Across the 3 studies, 96% of patients received at least 14 days of treatment with XIFAXAN. In Trials 1 and 2, 624 patients received only one 14-day treatment. Trial 3 evaluated the safety of XIFAXAN in 328 patients who received 1 open-label treatment and 2 double-blind repeat treatments of 14 days each over a period of up to 46 weeks. The combined population studied had a mean age of 47 (range: 18 to 88) years of whom approximately 11% of the patients were >65 years old, 72% were female, 88% were White, 9% were Black and 12% were Hispanic. The adverse reaction that occurred at a frequency >=2% in XIFAXAN-treated patients at a higher rate than placebo in Trials 1 and 2 for IBS-D was: -nausea (3% XIFAXAN, 2% placebo) The adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency >2% in XIFAXAN-treated patients (n=328) at a higher rate than placebo (n=308) in Trial 3 for IBS-D during the double-blind treatment phase were: -ALT increased (XIFAXAN 2%, placebo 1%) -nausea (XIFAXAN 2%, placebo 1%) Less Common Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions, presented by body system, were reported in less than 2% of patients in clinical trials of TD and IBS-D and in less than 5% of patients in clinical trials of HE: Hepatobiliary disorders: Clostridium colitis Investigations: Increased blood creatine phosphokinase Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of XIFAXAN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting or causal connection to XIFAXAN. Infections and Infestations Cases of C. difficile-associated colitis have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. General Hypersensitivity reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, rash, angioneurotic edema (swelling of face and tongue and difficulty swallowing), urticaria, flushing, pruritus and anaphylaxis have been reported. These events occurred as early as within 15 minutes of drug administration."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Travelers' Diarrhea Not Caused by E. coli: XIFAXAN was not effective in diarrhea complicated by fever and/or blood in the stool or diarrhea due to pathogens other than E. coli. If diarrhea symptoms get worse or persist for more than 24 to 48 hours, discontinue XIFAXAN and consider alternative antibiotics (5.1) - Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs after therapy or does not improve or worsens during therapy (5.2) -Hepatic Impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment (5.4, 8.7) -Concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitor: Caution should be exercised when concomitant use of XIFAXAN and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor is needed (5.5, 7.2). 5.1 Travelers' Diarrhea Not Caused by Escherichia coli XIFAXAN was not found to be effective in patients with diarrhea complicated by fever and/or blood in the stool or diarrhea due to pathogens other than Escherichia coli. Discontinue XIFAXAN if diarrhea symptoms get worse or persist more than 24 to 48 hours and alternative antibiotic therapy should be considered. XIFAXAN is not effective in cases of travelers' diarrhea due to Campylobacter jejuni. The effectiveness of XIFAXAN in travelers' diarrhea caused by Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. has not been proven. XIFAXAN should not be used in patients where Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp., or Salmonella spp. may be suspected as causative pathogens [see Indications and Usage (1.1)]. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including XIFAXAN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon which may lead to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing XIFAXAN for travelers' diarrhea in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.4 Severe (Child-Pugh Class C) Hepatic Impairment There is increased systemic exposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The clinical trials were limited to patients with MELD scores <25. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering XIFAXAN to patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 5.5 Concomitant Use with P-glycoprotein Inhibitors Concomitant administration of drugs that are P-glycoprotein inhibitors with XIFAXAN can substantially increase the systemic exposure to rifaximin. Caution should be exercised when concomitant use of XIFAXAN and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor such as cyclosporine is needed. In patients with hepatic impairment, a potential additive effect of reduced metabolism and concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitors may further increase the systemic exposure to rifaximin [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]."
