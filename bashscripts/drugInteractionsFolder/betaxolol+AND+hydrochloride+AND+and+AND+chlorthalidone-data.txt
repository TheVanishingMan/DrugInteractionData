        "Drug Interactions The following drugs have been coadministered with betaxolol and have not altered its pharmacokinetics: cimetidine, nifedipine, chlorthalidone, and hydrochlorothiazide. Concomitant administration of betaxolol with the oral anticoagulant warfarin has been shown not to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Catecholamine-depleting drugs (eg, reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Should it be decided to discontinue therapy in patients receiving beta-blockers and clonidine concurrently, the beta-blocker should be discontinued slowly over several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. Literature reports suggest that oral calcium antagonists may be used in combination with beta-adrenergic blocking agents when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function. Hypotension, AV conduction disturbances, and left ventricular failure have been reported in some patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents when an oral calcium antagonist was added to the treatment regimen. Hypotension was more likely to occur if the calcium antagonist were a dihydropyridine derivative, eg, nifedipine, while left ventricular failure and AV conduction disturbances, including complete heart block, were more likely to occur with either verapamil or diltiazem. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers. Disopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, 0Hasystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient and are typical of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, eg, bradycardia, fatigue, dyspnea, and lethargy. Withdrawal of therapy in U.S. and European controlled clinical trials has been necessary in about 3.5% of patients, principally because of bradycardia, fatigue, dizziness, headache, and impotence. Frequency estimates of adverse events were derived from controlled studies in which adverse reactions were volunteered and elicited in U.S. studies and volunteered and/or elicited in European studies. In the U.S., the placebo-controlled hypertension studies lasted for 4 weeks, while the active-controlled hypertension studies had a 22- to 24-week double-blind phase. The following doses were studied: betaxolol—5, 10, 20, and 40 mg once daily; atenolol—25, 50, and 100 mg once daily; and propranolol—40, 80, and 160 mg b.i.d. Betaxolol, like other beta-blockers, has been associated with the development of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (e.g., lupus erythematosus). In controlled clinical studies, conversion of ANA from negative to positive occurred in 5.3% of the patients treated with betaxolol, 6.3% of the patients treated with atenolol, 4.9% of the patients treated with propranolol, and 3.2% of the patients treated with placebo. Betaxolol adverse events reported with a 2% or greater frequency, and selected events with lower frequency, in U.S. controlled studies are: Table 1 - Adverse Events Report Adverse Events for Betaxolol and Placebo-Treated Patients Dose Range Body System/Adverse Reaction Betaxolol (N=509) 5-40 mg q.d.*(%) Betaxolol (N=73) 40-160 mg b.i.d.(%) Betaxolol (N=75) 25-100 mg b.i.d.(%) Placebo (N=109) (%) Cardiovascular (heart rate <50 BPM) Symptomatic bradycardia Edema 8.1 0.8 1.8 4.1 1.4 0 12.0 0 0 0 Central Nervous System Headache Dizziness Fatigue Lethargy 6.5 4.5 2.9 2.8 4.1 11.0 9.6 4.1 5.3 2.7 4.0 2.7 15.6 5.5 0 0.9 Psychiatric Insomnia Nervousness Bizarre dreams Depression 1.2 0.8 1.00.8 8.2 1.4 2.7 2.7 2.7 2.7 1.3 4.0 0 0 0 0 Autonomic Impotence 1.2† 0 0 0 Respiratory Dyspnea Pharyngitis Rhinitis Upper respiratory infection 2.4 2.0 1.4 2.6 2.7 0 0 0 1.3 4.0 4.0 0 0.9 0.9 0.9 5.5 Gastrointestinal Dyspepsia Nausea Diarrhea 4.7 1.62.0 6.8 1.46.8 2.7 4.08.0 0.9 00.9 Musculoskeletal Chest pain Arthralgia 2.43.1 1.4 0 2.74.0 0.91.8 Skin Rash 1.2 0 0 0 *Five patients received 80 mg q.d. †N=336 males, impotence is a known possible adverse effect of this pharmacological class.

In Europe, the placebo-controlled study lasted for 4 weeks, while the comparative studies had a 4-52-week double-blind phase.

It is not known whether a causal relationship exists between betaxolol and these events; they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship: Autonomic: flushing, salivation, sweating. Body as a whole: allergy, fever, malaise, pain, rigors. Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, arrhythmia, atrioventricular block, heart failure, hypertension, hypotension, myocardial infarction, thrombosis, syncope. Central and peripheral nervous system: ataxia, neuralgia, neuropathy, numbness, speech disorder, stupor, tremor, twitching. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dry mouth, increased appetite, mouth ulceration, rectal disorders, vomiting, dysphagia. Hearing and Vestibular: earache, labyrinth disorders, tinnitus, deafness. Hematologic: anemia, leucocytosis, lymphadenopathy, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Liver and biliary: increased AST, increased ALT. Metabolic and nutritional: acidosis, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hyperlipemia, hyperuricemia, hypokalemia, weight gain, weight loss, thirst, increased LDH. Musculoskeletal: arthropathy, neck pain, muscle cramps, tendonitis. Psychiatric: abnormal thinking, amnesia, impaired concentration, confusion, emotional lability, hallucinations, decreased libido. Reproductive disorders: Female: breast pain, breast fibroadenosis, menstrual disorder; Male: Peyronie's disease, prostatitis. Respiratory: bronchitis, bronchospasm, cough, epistaxis, flu, pneumonia, sinusitis. Skin: alopecia, eczema, erythematous rash, hypertrichosis, pruritus, skin disorders. Special senses: abnormal taste, taste loss. Urinary system: cystitis, dysuria, micturition disorder, oliguria, proteinuria, abnormal renal function, renal pain. Vascular: cerebrovascular disorder, intermittent claudication, leg cramps, peripheral ischemia, thrombophlebitis. Vision: abnormal lacrimation, abnormal vision, blepharitis, ocular hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, dry eyes, iritis, cataract, scotoma. Potential adverse effects Although not reported in clinical studies with betaxolol, a variety of adverse effects have been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents and may be considered potential adverse effects of betaxolol: Central nervous system: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia, an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation for time and place, short-term memory loss, emotional lability with slightly clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on neuropsychometric tests. Allergic: Fever combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, respiratory distress. Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenic purpura, and nonthrombocytopenic purpura. Gastrointestinal: Mesenteric arterial thrombosis, ischemic colitis. Metabolic: Hypoglycemia. Miscellaneous: Raynaud's phenomena. There have been reports of skin rashes and/or dry eyes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. The reported incidence is small, and in most cases, the symptoms have cleared when treatment was withdrawn. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. Patients should be closely monitored following cessation of therapy. The oculomucocutaneous syndrome associated with the beta-blocker practolol has not been reported with betaxolol during investigational use and extensive foreign experience. However, dry eyes have been reported."
