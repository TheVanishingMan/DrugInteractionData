        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Kionex®Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate may cause some degree of gastric irritation. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and constipation may occur especially if high doses are given. Also, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and significant sodium retention, and their related clinical manifestations, may occur (seeWARNINGS). Occasionally diarrhea develops. Large doses in elderly individuals may cause fecal impaction (seePRECAUTIONS). Rare instances of colonic necrosis have been reported. Intestinal obstruction due to concretions of aluminum hydroxide, when used in combination with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, has been reported. The following events have been reported from worldwide post marketing experience: Fecal impaction following rectal administration, particularly in children; Gastrointestinal concretions (bezoars) following oral administration; Gastrointestinal tract ulceration or necrosis which could lead to intestinal perforation; and, Rare cases of acute bronchitis and/or bronchopneumonia associated with inhalation of particles of polystyrene sulfonate."

        "Drug Interactions Antacids: The simultaneous oral administration of Sodium Polystrene Sulfonate with nonabsorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives may reduce the resin's potassium exchange capability.
