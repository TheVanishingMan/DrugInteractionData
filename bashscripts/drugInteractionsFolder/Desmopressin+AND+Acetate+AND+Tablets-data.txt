Elevated AST (SGOT) returned to the normal range despite continued use of desmopressin acetate tablets. Primary Nocturnal Enuresis The only adverse event occurring in >= 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials with desmopressin acetate tablets that was probably, possibly, or remotely related to study drug was headache (4% desmopressin acetate, 3% placebo). Other The following adverse events have been reported; however their relationship to desmopressin acetate has not been established: abnormal thinking, diarrhea, and edema-weight gain. See for the possibility of water intoxication and hyponatremia. WARNINGS Postmarketing There have been rare reports of hyponatremic convulsions associated with concomitant use with the following medications: oxybutinin and imipramine."
