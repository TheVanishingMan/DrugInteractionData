        "Drug Interactions Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and dorzolamide hydrochloride - timolol maleate. The concomitant administration of dorzolamide hydrochloride - timolol maleate and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended. Acid-base disturbances: Although acid-base and electrolyte disturbances were not reported in the clinical trials with dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, these disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and have, in some instances, resulted in drug interactions (e.g., toxicity associated with high-dose salicylate therapy). Therefore, the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving dorzolamide hydrochloride -timolol maleate. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and dorzolamide hydrochloride - timolol maleate should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. Calcium antagonists: Caution should be used in the coadministration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as dorzolamide hydrochloride - timolol maleate, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, coadministration should be avoided. Catecholamine-depleting drugs: Close observation of the patient is recommended when a betablocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Digitalis and calcium antagonists: The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digital isand calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. CYP2D6 inhibitors: Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. Clonidine: Oral beta-adrenergic blocking agents may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. There have been no reports of exacerbation of rebound hypertension with ophthalmic timolol maleate. Injectable Epinephrine: (See PRECAUTIONS, General, Anaphylaxis.) Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a two-year study of dorzolamide hydrochloride administered orally to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, urinary bladder papillomas were seen in male rats in the highest dosage group of 20 mg/kg/day (250 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose). Papillomas were not seen in rats given oral doses equivalent to approximately 12 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose. No treatment-related tumors were seen in a 21-month study in female and male mice given oral doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (~900 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose). The increased incidence of urinary bladder papillomas seen in the high-dose male rats is a class effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in rats. Rats are particularly prone to developing papillomas in response to foreign bodies, compounds causing crystalluria, and diverse sodium salts. No changes in bladder urothelium were seen in dogs given oral dorzolamide hydrochloride for one year at 2 mg/kg/day (25 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) or monkeys dosed topically to the eye at 0.4 mg/kg/day (~5 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) for one year. In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day(approximately 42,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose). Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 14,000 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose. In a lifetime oral study of timolol maleate in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/ kg/day, (approximately 71,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 700 or 7,000, respectively, times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day. The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin. The following tests for mutagenic potential were negative for dorzolamide: (1) in vivo (mouse) cytogenetic assay; (2) in vitro chromosomal aberration assay; (3) alkaline elution assay; (4) V-79 assay; and (5) Ames test. Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 μg/mL). In Ames tests the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 μg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with either timolol maleate or dorzolamide hydrochloride demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at doses up to approximately 100 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose."

The most frequently reported adverse events were taste perversion (bitter, sour, or unusual taste) or ocular burning and/or stinging in up to 30% of patients. Conjunctival hyperemia, blurred vision, superficial punctate keratitis or eye itching were reported between 5-15% of patients. The following adverse events were reported in 1-5% of patients: abdominal pain, back pain, blepharitis, bronchitis, cloudy vision, conjunctival discharge, conjunctival edema, conjunctival follicles, conjunctival injection, conjunctivitis, corneal erosion, corneal staining, cortical lens opacity, cough, dizziness, dryness of eyes, dyspepsia, eye debris, eye discharge, eye pain, eye tearing, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, eyelid exudate/scales, eyelid pain or discomfort, foreign body sensation, glaucomatous cupping, headache, hypertension, influenza, lens nucleus coloration, lens opacity, nausea, nuclear lens opacity, pharyngitis, post-subcapsular cataract, sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, visual field defect, vitreous detachment. The following adverse events have occurred either at low incidence (<1%) during clinical trials or have been reported during the use of dorzolamide hydrochloride-timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in clinical practice where these events were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size and frequency of occurrence cannot be determined precisely. They have been chosen for inclusion based on factors such as seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to dorzolamide hydrochloride-timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, or a combination of these factors: bradycardia, cardiac failure, cerebral vascular accident, chest pain, choroidal detachment following filtration surgery (see PRECAUTIONS, General ), depression, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspnea, heart block, hypotension, iridocyclitis, myocardial infarction, nasal congestion, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, paresthesia, photophobia, respiratory failure, skin rashes, urolithiasis, and vomiting. Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the individual components are listed below: Dorzolamide — Allergic/Hypersensitivity: Signs and symptoms of local reactions including palpebral reactions and systemic allergic reactions including angioedema, bronchospasm, pruritus, urticaria; Body as a Whole: Asthenia/fatigue; Skin/Mucous Membranes: Contact dermatitis, epistaxis, throat irritation; Special Senses: Eyelid crusting, signs and symptoms of ocular allergic reaction, and transient myopia. Timolol (ocular administration) — Body as a Whole: Asthenia/fatigue; Cardiovascular: Arrhythmia, syncope, cerebral ischemia, worsening of angina pectoris, palpitation, cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema, edema, claudication, Raynaud's phenomenon, and cold hands and feet; Digestive: Anorexia; Immunologic: Systemic lupus erythematosus; Nervous System/Psychiatric: Increase in signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis, somnolence, insomnia, nightmares, behavioral changes and psychic disturbances including confusion, hallucinations, anxiety, disorientation, nervousness, and memory loss; Skin: Alopecia, psoriasiform rash or exacerbation of psoriasis; Hypersensitivity: Signs and symptoms of systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, and localized and generalized rash; Respiratory: Bronchospasm (predominantly in patients with pre-existing bronchospastic disease); Endocrine: Masked symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients (see WARNINGS); Special Senses: Ptosis, decreased corneal sensitivity, cystoid macular edema, visual disturbances including refractive changes and diplopia, pseudopemphigoid, and tinnitus; Urogenital: Retroperitoneal fibrosis, decreased libido, impotence, and Peyronie's disease.

        "Drug Interactions Although Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution and epinephrine has been reported occasionally. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. Calcium antagonists: Caution should be used in the coadministration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, coadministration should be avoided. Catecholamine-depleting drugs: Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Digitalis and calcium antagonists: The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. CYP2D6 inhibitors: Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. Clonidine: Oral beta-adrenergic blocking agents may exacerbate the rebound hypertension, which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.

        "Drug Interactions Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and Dorzolamide Hydrochloride-Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution. The concomitant administration of Dorzolamide Hydrochloride-Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended. Acid-base disturbances: Although acid-base and electrolyte disturbances were not reported in the clinical trials with dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, these disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and have, in some instances, resulted in drug interactions (e.g., toxicity associated with high-dose salicylate therapy). Therefore, the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving Dorzolamide Hydrochloride-Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and Dorzolamide Hydrochloride-Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. Calcium antagonists: Caution should be used in the coadministration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as Dorzolamide Hydrochloride-Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, coadministration should be avoided. Catecholamine-depleting drugs: Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Digitalis and calcium antagonists: The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. CYP2D6 inhibitors: Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. Clonidine: Oral beta-adrenergic blocking agents may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. There have been no reports of exacerbation of rebound hypertension with ophthalmic timolol maleate. Injectable Epinephrine: (See PRECAUTIONS, General, Anaphylaxis.)"

Patients should not usually receive two topical ophthalmic beta-adrenergic receptor inhibiting agents concurrently. 7.2 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibiting agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors, such as Timolol GFS, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, or hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.3 Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta receptor inhibitor is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.4 Quinidine Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate) has been reported during combined treatment with quinidine and timolol, possibly because quinidine inhibits the metabolism of timolol via the P-450 enzyme, CYP2D6. 7.5 Clonidine Oral beta-adrenergic receptor inhibiting agents may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. There have been no reports of exacerbation of rebound hypertension with ophthalmic timolol maleate. 7.6 Injectable Epinephrine [See Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions occur upon instillation and include transient blurred vision, burning, and stinging (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials with Timolol GFS, transient blurred vision upon instillation of the drop was reported in approximately one in three patients. The frequency of patients reporting burning and stinging upon instillation was approximately one in eight patients which was comparable to that observed for TIMOPTIC*. Adverse reactions reported in 1-5% of patients were: Ocular: Blepharitis, conjunctivitis, crusting, discomfort, foreign body sensation, hyperemia, pruritus and tearing; Systemic: Headache, hypertension, and upper respiratory infections. In a 3-month, double-masked, active-controlled, multicenter study in pediatric patients, the adverse reactions profile of Timolol GFS 0.25% and 0.5% was comparable to that seen in adult patients. 6.2 Additional Potential Adverse Reactions Associated with Timolol Maleate The following additional adverse experiences have been reported with the ocular administration of this or other timolol maleate formulations: BODY AS A WHOLE Asthenia/fatigue and chest pain. CARDIOVASCULAR Bradycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension, hypertension, syncope, heart block, cerebral vascular accident, cerebral ischemia, cardiac failure, worsening of angina pectoris, palpitation, cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema, dizziness, edema, claudication, Raynaud's phenomenon, and cold hands and feet. DIGESTIVE Nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, anorexia, and dry mouth. IMMUNOLOGIC Systemic lupus erythematosus. NERVOUS SYSTEM/PSYCHIATRIC Increase in signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis, paresthesia, somnolence, insomnia, nightmares, behavioral changes and psychic disturbances including confusion, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, disorientation, nervousness, and memory loss. SKIN Alopecia and psoriasiform rash or exacerbation of psoriasis. HYPERSENSITIVITY Signs and symptoms of systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria and localized and generalized rash. RESPIRATORY Bronchospasm (predominantly in patients with pre-existing bronchospastic disease), respiratory failure, dyspnea, nasal congestion, and cough. ENDOCRINE Masked symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. SPECIAL SENSES Signs and symptoms of ocular irritation including blepharitis, keratitis, and dry eyes; ptosis; decreased corneal sensitivity; cystoid macular edema; visual disturbances including refractive changes and diplopia; pseudopemphigoid; choroidal detachment following filtration surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]; and tinnitus. UROGENITAL Retroperitoneal fibrosis, decreased libido, impotence and Peyronie's disease."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Same adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may occur with topical ophthalmic administration (5.1). - Beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may mask signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and should be administered with caution in diabetic patients subject to hypoglycemia (5.5). - Beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may mask certain clinical signs (e.g. tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism (5.6). 5.1 General As with many topically applied ophthalmic drugs, this drug is absorbed systemically. The same adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may occur with topical ophthalmic administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and death due to cardiac failure, have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, Timolol GFS should be discontinued. 5.3 Bronchospasm and Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Bronchospasm may occur. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which Timolol GFS is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]) should, in general, not receive beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors, including Timolol GFS. 5.4 Surgical Anesthesia The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors have experienced protracted, severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. In patients undergoing elective surgery, consider gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists. 5.5 Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors should be administered with caution in diabetic patients subject to hypoglycemia who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.6 Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors may mask certain clinical signs (e.g. tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.7 Cerebrovascular Insufficiency Because of potential effects of beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitors on blood pressure and pulse, these agents should be used with caution in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency. If signs or symptoms suggesting reduced cerebral blood flow develop following initiation of therapy with Timolol GFS, alternative therapy should be considered. 5.8 Bacterial Keratitis Bacterial keratitis may occur with use of multiple dose containers of topical ophthalmic products when these containers are inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. Instruct patients on appropriate instillation techniques [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.9 Choroidal Detachment Choroidal detachment after filtration procedures has been reported with the administration of aqueous suppressant (e.g., timolol) therapy. 5.10 Angle-Closure Glaucoma In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, the immediate objective of treatment is to reopen the angle. This may require constricting the pupil. Timolol GFS has little or no effect on the pupil and should not be used alone in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma. 5.11 Atopy/Anaphylaxis While taking beta receptor inhibitors, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.12 Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Potentiation of Respiratory Reactions Including Asthma (5.1) -Cardiac Failure (5.2) -Sulfonamide Hypersensitivity (5.3) -Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (5.4) -Increased Reactivity to Allergens (5.5) -Potentiation of Muscle Weakness (5.6) -Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus (5.7) -Masking of Thyrotoxicosis (5.8) -Renal and Hepatic Impairment (5.9) -Impairment of Beta-Adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery (5.10) 5.1 Potentiation of Respiratory Reactions Including Asthma Dorzolamide HCl/Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution contains timolol maleate, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent; and although administered topically, is absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure, have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, Dorzolamide HCl/Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution should be discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.3 Sulfonamide Hypersensitivity Dorzolamide HCl/Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution contains dorzolamide, a sulfonamide; and although administered topically, it is absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topical administration of Dorzolamide HCl/Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution. Fatalities have occurred, although rarely, due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias. Sensitization may recur when a sulfonamide is readministered irrespective of the route of administration. If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the use of this preparation [see Contraindications (4.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.4 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which Dorzolamide HCl/Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution is contraindicated) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including Dorzolamide HCl/Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution [see Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Renal and Hepatic Impairment Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min). Because dorzolamide and its metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, Dorzolamide HCl/Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution is not recommended in such patients. Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients. 5.10 Impairment of Beta-Adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists. 5.11 Corneal Endothelium Carbonic anhydrase activity has been observed in both the cytoplasm and around the plasma membranes of the corneal endothelium. There is an increased potential for developing corneal edema in patients with low endothelial cell counts. Caution should be used when prescribing Dorzolamide HCl/Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution to this group of patients. 5.12 Bacterial Keratitis There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17.4)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensives/cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure. (7.1) Concomitant use with systemic beta-blockers may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. (7.2) Oral or intravenous calcium antagonists may cause atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. (7.3) Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects and produce hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. (7.4) Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect. (7.5) Digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. (7.6) CYP2D6 inhibitors may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. (7.7) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. (7.8) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. (7.9) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because COMBIGAN(R) may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with COMBIGAN(R) is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and COMBIGAN(R) should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as COMBIGAN(R) , and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with COMBIGAN(R) , the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with COMBIGAN(R) in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

(7.2) Concomitant use with systemic beta-blockers may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. (7.3) Oral or intravenous calcium antagonists may cause atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. (7.4) Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects and produce hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. (7.5) Digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. (7.6) CYP2D6 inhibitors may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. (7.7) 7.1 Oral Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors There is a potential for an additive effect on the known systemic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibition in patients receiving an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and COSOPT PF. The concomitant administration of COSOPT PF and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended. 7.2 High-Dose Salicylate Therapy Although acid-base and electrolyte disturbances were not reported in the clinical trials with dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, these disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and have, in some instances, resulted in drug interactions (e.g., toxicity associated with high-dose salicylate therapy). Therefore, the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving COSOPT PF. 7.3 Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and COSOPT PF should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.4 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the coadministration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as COSOPT PF, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, coadministration should be avoided. 7.5 Catecholamine-Depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Clonidine Oral beta-adrenergic blocking agents may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine.

COSOPT and COSOPT PF COSOPT and COSOPT PF were evaluated in patients with elevated intraocular pressure treated for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for up to 15 months. Approximately 5% of all patients discontinued therapy because of adverse reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in up to 30% of patients were taste perversion (bitter, sour, or unusual taste) or ocular burning and/or stinging. The following adverse reactions were reported in 5-15% of patients: conjunctival hyperemia, blurred vision, superficial punctate keratitis or eye itching.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potentiation of Respiratory Reactions Including Asthma (5.1) Cardiac Failure (5.2) Sulfonamide Hypersensitivity (5.3) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (5.4) Increased Reactivity to Allergens (5.5) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness (5.6) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus (5.7) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis (5.8) Renal and Hepatic Impairment (5.9) Impairment of Beta-Adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery (5.10) 5.1 Potentiation of Respiratory Reactions Including Asthma COSOPT PF contains timolol maleate, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent; and although administered topically, is absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure, have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, COSOPT PF should be discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. 5.3 Sulfonamide Hypersensitivity COSOPT PF contains dorzolamide, a sulfonamide; and although administered topically, it is absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topical administration of COSOPT PF. Fatalities have occurred, although rarely, due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias. Sensitization may recur when a sulfonamide is readministered irrespective of the route of administration. If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the use of this preparation [see Contraindications (4.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]. 5.4 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which COSOPT PF is contraindicated) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including COSOPT PF [see Contraindications (4.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Renal and Hepatic Impairment Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min). Because dorzolamide and its metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, COSOPT PF is not recommended in such patients. Dorzolamide has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and should therefore be used with caution in such patients. 5.10 Impairment of Beta-Adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists. 5.11 Corneal Endothelium Carbonic anhydrase activity has been observed in both the cytoplasm and around the plasma membranes of the corneal endothelium. There is an increased potential for developing corneal edema in patients with low endothelial cell counts. Caution should be used when prescribing COSOPT PF to this group of patients."

        "Drug Interactions Although timolol used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with timolol and epinephrine has been reported occasionally. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and timolol should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. Calcium antagonists: Caution should be used in the coadministration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as timolol, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, coadministration should be avoided. Catecholamine-depleting drugs: Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Digitalis and calcium antagonists: The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time.

The concomitant administration of dorzolamide hydrochloride-timolol maleate ophthalmic solution and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is not recommended. Acid-base disturbances: Although acid-base and electrolyte disturbances were not reported in the clinical trials with dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, these disturbances have been reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and have, in some instances, resulted in drug interactions (e.g., toxicity associated with high-dose salicylate therapy). Therefore, the potential for such drug interactions should be considered in patients receiving dorzolamide hydrochloride-timolol maleate ophthalmic solution.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensives/cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure. (7.1) Concomitant use with systemic beta-blockers may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. (7.2) Oral or intravenous calcium antagonists may cause atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. (7.3) Catecholamine-depleting drugs may have additive effects and produce hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. (7.4) Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect. (7.5) Digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. (7.6) CYP2D6 inhibitors may potentiate systemic beta-blockade. (7.7) Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. (7.8) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension. (7.9) 7.1 Antihypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides Because COMBIGAN(R) may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with COMBIGAN(R) is advised. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent either orally or intravenously and COMBIGAN(R) should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. 7.3 Calcium Antagonists Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as COMBIGAN(R) , and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. 7.4 Catecholamine-depleting Drugs Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. 7.5 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with COMBIGAN(R) , the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered. 7.6 Digitalis and Calcium Antagonists The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. 7.7 CYP2D6 Inhibitors Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol. 7.8 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with COMBIGAN(R) in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP-lowering effect. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines. 7.9 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side effect such as hypotension. Caution, however, is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions (5.1) Cardiac Failure (5.2) Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (5.3) Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency (5.4) Increased Reactivity to Allergens (5.5) Potentiation of Muscle Weakness (5.6) Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus (5.7) Masking of Thyrotoxicosis (5.8) Ocular Hypersensitivity (5.9) 5.1 Potential for Severe Respiratory or Cardiac Reactions COMBIGAN(R) contains timolol maleate; and although administered topically can be absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Additionally, ophthalmic beta-blockers may impair compensatory tachycardia and increase risk of hypotension. 5.2 Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, COMBIGAN(R) should be discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2)]. 5.3 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma, in which COMBIGAN(R) is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)]) should, in general, not receive beta-blocking agents, including COMBIGAN(R) . 5.4 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency COMBIGAN(R) may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. COMBIGAN(R) should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.5 Increased Reactivity to Allergens While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. 5.6 Potentiation of Muscle Weakness Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Timolol has been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. 5.7 Masking of Hypoglycemic Symptoms in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. 5.8 Masking of Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that might precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.9 Ocular Hypersensitivity Ocular hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions 0.2%, with some reported to be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure [see Contraindications (4.4)]. 5.10 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.11 Impairment of Beta-adrenergically Mediated Reflexes During Surgery The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists."
