      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug and Treatment Interactions Because of its amitriptyline component, chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or compounds with a similar mechanism of action. Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6: The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7% to 10% of Caucasians are so called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small or quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA). In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the type 1c antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary). Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from cotherapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6. The effects of concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride and other psychotropic drugs have not been evaluated. Sedative effects may be additive. Cimetidine is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs. Clinically significant effects have been reported with the tricyclic antidepressants when used concomitantly with cimetidine (Tagamet®). The drug should be discontinued several days before elective surgery. Concurrent administration of ECT and chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride should be limited to those patients for whom it is essential."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride are those associated with the use of either component alone. Most frequently reported were drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness and bloating. Other side effects occurring less commonly included vivid dreams, impotence, tremor, confusion and nasal congestion. Many symptoms common to the depressive state, such as anorexia, fatigue, weakness, restlessness and lethargy, have been reported as side effects of treatment with both chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline HCl tablets and amitriptyline. Granulocytopenia, jaundice and hepatic dysfunction of uncertain etiology have also been observed rarely with chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride. When treatment with chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride is prolonged, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable. Note: Included in the listing which follows are adverse reactions which have not been reported with chlordiazepoxide and amitriptyline hydrochloride. However, they are included because they have been reported during therapy with one or both of the components or closely related drugs. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart block, stroke. Psychiatric: Euphoria, apprehension, poor concentration, delusions, hallucinations, hypomania and increased or decreased libido. Neurologic: Incoordination, ataxia, numbness, tingling and paresthesias of the extremities, extrapyramidal symptoms, syncope, changes in EEG patterns. Anticholinergic: Disturbance of accommodation, paralytic ileus, urinary retention, dilatation of urinary tract. Allergic: Skin rash, urticaria, photosensitization, edema of face and tongue, pruritus. Hematologic: Bone marrow depression including agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, epigastric distress, vomiting, anorexia, stomatitis, peculiar taste, diarrhea, black tongue. Endocrine: Testicular swelling and gynecomastia in the male, breast enlargement, galactorrhea and minor menstrual irregularities in the female, elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels, and syndrome of inappropriate ADH (antidiuretic hormone) secretion. Other: Headache, weight gain or loss, increased perspiration, urinary frequency, mydriasis, jaundice, alopecia, parotid swelling."

If you do not know if your prescription drug contains an MAOI, ask a doctor or pharmacist before taking this product. The use of dextromethorphan may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, antihistamines, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression. Patients may develop hypotension, hyperpyrexia, nausea, myoclonic leg jerks and coma following coadministration of MAO inhibitors and dextromethorphan. MAO inhibitors also prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines. Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effect of methyldopa, reserpine, veratrum, alkaloids and mecamylamine. Alcohol and other sedative drugs will potentiate the sedative effects of Chlorpheniramine. Care should be taken in administering this product concomitantly with other sympathomimetic amines since their combined effect on the cardiovascular system may be harmful to the patient."

Such side effects have been infrequent, and are generally controlled with reduction of dosage. Changes in EEG patterns (low-voltage fast activity) have been observed in patients during and after chlordiazepoxide HCl treatment. Blood dyscrasias (including agranulocytosis), jaundice and hepatic dysfunction have occasionally been reported during therapy. When chlordiazepoxide HCl treatment is protracted, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS No side effects or manifestations not seen with either compound alone have been reported with the administration of Librax. However, since Librax contains chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide, the possibility of untoward effects which may be seen with either of these two compounds cannot be excluded. When chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride has been used alone the necessity of discontinuing therapy because of undesirable effects has been rare. Drowsiness, ataxia and confusion have been reported in some patients — particularly the elderly and debilitated. While these effects can be avoided in almost all instances by proper dosage adjustment, they have occasionally been observed at the lower dosage ranges. In a few instances syncope has been reported. Other adverse reactions reported during therapy with chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride include isolated instances of skin eruptions, edema, minor menstrual irregularities, nausea and constipation, extrapyramidal symptoms, as well as increased and decreased libido. Such side effects have been infrequent and are generally controlled with reduction of dosage. Changes in EEG patterns (low-voltage fast activity) have been observed in patients during and after chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride treatment. Blood dyscrasias, including agranulocytosis, jaundice and hepatic dysfunction have occasionally been reported during therapy with chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride. When chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride treatment is protracted, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable. Adverse effects reported with use of Librax are those typical of anticolinergic agents, ie, dryness of the mouth, blurring of vision, urinary hesitancy and constipation. Constipation has occurred most often when Librax therapy has been combined with other spasmolytic agents and/or a low residue diet."

        "4. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and Clidinium Bromide Capsules may produce drowsiness and blurred vision. The patient should be warned about engaging in hazardous work or activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery. Use caution when prescribing Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and Clidinium Bromide Capsules concurrently with psychotropic agents, especially those that include MAQ exhibitors and phenothiazines. Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed, along with patients being treated for anxiety or depression. Paradoxical reactions to Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, e.g., excitement, stimulation and acute rage, have been reported in psychiatric patients and should be considered during Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and clidinium Bromide Capsule therapy."
