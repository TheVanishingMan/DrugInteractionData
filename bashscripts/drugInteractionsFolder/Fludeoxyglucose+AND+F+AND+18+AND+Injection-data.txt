In a small, 42 patient subset of the 374 patients studied, 4 patients had transient hypotension, 6 had hypo- or hyperglycemia and 3 had transient increases in alkaline phosphatase. Reviews of the oncology and cardiology literature did not reveal reported adverse reactions."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Radiation risks: use smallest dose necessary for imaging (5.1). Blood glucose abnormalities: may cause suboptimal imaging (5.2). 5.1 Radiation Risks Radiation-emitting products, including Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection, USP, may increase the risk for cancer, especially in pediatric patients. Use the smallest dose necessary for imaging and ensure safe handling to protect the patient and health care worker[see Dosage and Administration(2.5)]. 5.2 Blood Glucose Abnormalities In the oncology and neurology setting, suboptimal imaging may occur in patients with inadequately regulated blood glucose levels. In these patients, consider medical therapy and laboratory testing to assure at least two days of normoglycemia prior to Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection, USP administration."
