(5.11) 7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers on CAPRELSA Rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased vandetanib plasma concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of known strong CYP3A4 inducers during CAPRELSA therapy. Avoid concomitant use of St. John's Wort because it can decrease vandetanib exposure unpredictably [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Effect of CAPRELSA on OCT2 Transporter CAPRELSA increased plasma concentrations of metformin that is transported by the organic cation transporter type 2 (OCT2). Use caution and closely monitor for toxicities when administering CAPRELSA with drugs that are transported by OCT2 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Effect of CAPRELSA on Digoxin CAPRELSA increased plasma concentrations of digoxin. Use caution and closely monitor for toxicities when administering CAPRELSA with digoxin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.4 Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval Avoid concomitant use of CAPRELSA with agents that may prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]."

ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label: -QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] -Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] -Interstitial Lung Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] -Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] -Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] -Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] -Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] -Hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] -Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] -Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] -Embryofetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The most common adverse drug reactions (>20%) seen with CAPRELSA and with a between-arm difference of >=5 % have been diarrhea/colitis, rash, acneiform dermatitis, hypertension, nausea, headache, upper respiratory tract infections, decreased appetite and abdominal pain. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer were treated with CAPRELSA 300 mg (n=231) or Placebo (n=99). The population exposed to CAPRELSA was 58% male, 94% white, and had a median age of 50 years. The data described below reflect a median exposure to CAPRELSA for 607 days. The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions which occurred in >20% of CAPRELSA-treated patients and with a between-arm difference of >=5% included, in order of decreasing frequency: diarrhea/colitis, rash, acneiform dermatitis, hypertension, nausea, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain. Among CAPRELSA-treated patients, dose interruption occurred in 109 (47%) and dose reduction occurred in 83 (36%). Adverse reactions led to study treatment discontinuation in 28 of 231 patients (12%) receiving CAPRELSA and in 3 of 99 patients (3.0%) receiving placebo. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in 2 or more (>=0.9%) patients treated with CAPRELSA were: asthenia (1.7%), rash (1.7%), diarrhea (0.9%), fatigue (0.9%), pyrexia (0.9%), elevated creatinine (0.9%), QT prolongation (0.9%), and hypertension (0.9%).

Blurred vision was more common in patients who received CAPRELSA versus patients who received placebo for medullary thyroid cancer (9% vs. 1%, respectively). Scheduled slit lamp examinations revealed corneal opacities (vortex keratopathies) in treated patients, which can lead to halos and decreased visual acuity. Perform ophthalmologic examination, including slit lamp examination, in patients who report visual changes. Class effects CAPRELSA is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) signaling. Inhibition of VEGFR signaling can result in intestinal perforation. Intestinal perforation occurred in 0.4% of CAPRELSA treated patients versus 0% of placebo treated patients. The incidence of Grade 1-2 bleeding events was 14% in patients receiving CAPRELSA compared with 7% on placebo in the randomized portion of the medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) study.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Prolonged QT Interval, Torsades de pointes, and sudden death: Monitor electrocardiograms and levels of serum potassium, calcium, magnesium and TSH. Reduce CAPRELSA dose as appropriate. (2.1, 5.1) -Severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some resulting in death: Consider discontinuation of CAPRELSA for severe skin reactions. (2.1, 5.2) -Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities: investigate unexplained non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Discontinue CAPRELSA for confirmed ILD. (2.1, 5.3) -Ischemic cerebrovascular events, hemorrhage, heart failure, diarrhea, hypertension, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome: Discontinue or interrupt CAPRELSA. (2.1, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10) -Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy during and for four months following treatment with CAPRELSA. (5.14, 8.1) -REMS: CAPRELSA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the CAPRELSA REMS Program. (5.15) 5.1 QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes CAPRELSA can prolong the QT interval in a concentration-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and sudden deaths have occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Do not start CAPRELSA treatment in patients whose QTcF interval is greater than 450 ms. Do not administer CAPRELSA to patients who have a history of Torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure. CAPRELSA has not been studied in patients with ventricular arrhythmias or recent myocardial infarction. Vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function. Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and monitor QT interval frequently. Obtain an ECG and serum potassium, calcium, magnesium and TSH at baseline, 2-4 weeks and 8-12 weeks after starting treatment with CAPRELSA, and every 3 months thereafter. Monitor electrolytes and ECGs more frequently in patients who experience diarrhea. Following any dose reduction for QT prolongation or any dose interruption greater than 2 weeks, conduct QT assessments as described above. Maintain serum potassium levels of 4 mEq/L or higher (within normal range) and maintain serum magnesium and calcium levels within normal ranges to reduce the risk of QT prolongation. Avoid using CAPRELSA with drugs known to prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. If such drugs are given to patients already receiving CAPRELSA and no alternative therapy exists, perform ECG monitoring of the QT interval more frequently. Stop CAPRELSA in patients who develop a QTcF greater than 500 ms until the QTcF returns to less than 450 ms. Dosing of CAPRELSA can then be resumed at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe skin reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis), some leading to death, have occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. For severe skin reactions, referral of the patient to seek urgent medical advice is recommended. Systemic therapies e.g., steroids, may be appropriate in such cases and permanent discontinuation of CAPRELSA is recommended[see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Photosensitivity reactions can occur during CAPRELSA treatment and up to 4 months after treatment discontinuation. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or pneumonitis, including fatalities, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Consider a diagnosis of ILD in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Interrupt CAPRELSA for acute or worsening pulmonary symptoms. Discontinue CAPRELSA if ILD is confirmed. 5.4 Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events Ischemic cerebrovascular events, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. In the randomized medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) study, ischemic cerebrovascular events occurred more frequently with CAPRELSA compared to placebo (1.3% compared to 0%). The safety of resumption of CAPRELSA therapy after resolution of an ischemic cerebrovascular event has not been studied. Discontinue CAPRELSA in patients who experience a severe ischemic cerebrovascular event. 5.5 Hemorrhage Serious hemorrhagic events, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Do not administer CAPRELSA to patients with a recent history of hemoptysis of >=1/2 teaspoon of red blood. Discontinue CAPRELSA in patients with severe hemorrhage. 5.6 Heart Failure Heart failure, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Consider discontinuation of CAPRELSA in patients with heart failure. Heart failure may not be reversible upon stopping CAPRELSA. 5.7 Diarrhea Diarrhea of Grade 3 or greater severity occurred in 11% of patients receiving CAPRELSA in the randomized MTC study. If diarrhea occurs, carefully monitor serum electrolytes and ECGs to reduce the risk and enable early detection of QT prolongation resulting from dehydration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Interrupt CAPRELSA for severe diarrhea. Upon improvement, resume CAPRELSA at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.8 Hypothyroidism In the randomized MTC study in which 90% of the patients enrolled had prior thyroidectomy, increased dosing of thyroid replacement therapy was required in 49% of CAPRELSA-treated patients compared to 17% of placebo-treated patients. Obtain Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at baseline, at 2-4 weeks and 8-12 weeks after starting treatment with CAPRELSA, and every 3 months thereafter. If signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism occur, examine thyroid hormone levels and adjust thyroid replacement therapy accordingly. 5.9 Hypertension Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Monitor all patients for hypertension. Dose reduction or interruption for hypertension may be necessary. If hypertension cannot be controlled, do not resume CAPRELSA [see Dosage and Administration, (2.1) ]. 5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by an MRI of the brain, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Consider this syndrome in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. In clinical studies, three of four patients who developed RPLS while taking CAPRELSA also had hypertension. Discontinue CAPRELSA treatment in patients with RPLS. 5.11 Drug Interactions Avoid administration of CAPRELSA with anti-arrhythmic drugs (including but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, sotalol, dofetilide) and other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (including but not limited to chloroquine, clarithromycin, dolasetron, granisetron, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, and pimozide) [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 5.12 Renal Impairment Vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function. Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and monitor the QT interval closely. There is no information available for patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.13 Hepatic Impairment CAPRELSA is not recommended for use in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, as safety and efficacy have not been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.14 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, CAPRELSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In nonclinical studies in rats, vandetanib was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic at exposures equivalent to or lower than those expected at the recommended human dose of 300 mg/day and had adverse effects on female fertility, embryofetal development, and postnatal development of pups. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy. Advise women of childbearing potential that they must use effective contraception during CAPRELSA treatment and for at least four months following the last dose of CAPRELSA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , (8.8) ]. 5.15 CAPRELSA REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program Because of the risk of QT prolongation, Torsades de pointes, and sudden death, CAPRELSA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the CAPRELSA REMS Program. Only prescribers and pharmacies certified with the program are able to prescribe and dispense CAPRELSA. To learn about the specific REMS requirements and to enroll in the CAPRELSA REMS Program, call 1-800-236-9933 or visit www.caprelsarems.com."

Adverse reactions resulting in death in patients receiving placebo were gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1%) and gastroenteritis (1%). In addition there was one sudden death and one death from cardiopulmonary arrest, in patients receiving vandetanib after data cut-off. Causes of discontinuation in vandetanib-treated patients in >1 patient included asthenia, fatigue, rash, arthralgia, diarrhea, hypertension, prolonged QT interval, increase in creatinine and pyrexia. Serious adverse events in vandetanib-treated patients in >2% of patients included diarrhea, pneumonia, and hypertension. Clinically important uncommon adverse drug reactions in patients who received vandetanib versus patients who received placebo included pancreatitis (0.4% vs. 0%) and heart failure (0.9% vs. 0%). In the integrated summary of safety database, the most common cause of death in patients who received vandetanib was pneumonia.The incidence of Grade 1-2 bleeding events was 14% in patients receiving vandetanib compared with 7% on placebo in the randomized portion of the medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) study. The incidence was similar in the 300 mg monotherapy safety program with a 13% incidence. Blurred vision was more common in patients who received vandetanib versus patients who received placebo for medullary thyroid cancer (9% vs. 1%, respectively). Scheduled slit lamp examinations have revealed corneal opacities (vortex keratopathies) in treated patients, which can lead to halos and decreased visual acuity. It is unknown if this will improve after discontinuation. Ophthalmologic examination, including slit lamp, is recommended in patients who report visual changes. If a patient has blurred vision, do not drive or operate machinery.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Prolonged QT Interval, Torsades de pointes, and sudden death have been reported. Monitor electrocardiograms and levels of serum potassium, calcium, magnesium and TSH at baseline, 2-4 weeks and 8-12 weeks after starting treatment with vandetanib, and every 3 months thereafter and following dose adjustments. Dose reduce as appropriate (2.1, 5.1). Stevens-Johnson syndrome resulting in death has been observed. Severe skin reactions may prompt permanent discontinuation of vandetanib (2.1, 5.2). Interstitial lung disease, resulting in death has been reported. Interrupt vandetanib and investigate unexplained dyspnea, cough, and fever. Appropriate measures should be taken for ILD (2.1, 5.3). Ischemic cerebrovascular events, hemorrhage, heart failure, diarrhea, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, have been observed (2.1, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10). Vandetanib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be advised to avoid pregnancy while receiving vandetanib and for four months following treatment (5.14, 8.1). Because of the risks of QT prolongation, Torsades de pointes and sudden death, vandetanib is available only through a restricted distribution program called the Vandetanib REMS Program. Only prescribers and pharmacies certified with the program are able to prescribe and dispense vandetanib. To learn about the specific REMS requirements and to enroll in the Vandetanib REMS Program call 1-800-236-9933 or visit www.vandetanibrems.com (5.15). 5.1 QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes Vandetanib can prolong the QT interval in a concentration-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. Torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and sudden deaths have been reported in patients administered vandetanib. Vandetanib treatment should not be started in patients whose QTcF interval is greater than 450 ms. Vandetanib should not be given to patients who have a history of Torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure. Vandetanib has not been studied in patients with ventricular arrhythmias or recent myocardial infarction. Vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function. The starting dose should be reduced to 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and QT interval should be monitored closely. An ECG and levels of serum potassium, calcium, magnesium and TSH should be obtained at baseline, at 2-4 weeks and 8-12 weeks after starting treatment with vandetanib and every 3 months thereafter. Electrolytes and ECGs may require more frequent monitoring in case of diarrhea. Following any dose reduction for QT prolongation, or any dose interruptions greater than 2 weeks, QT assessments should be conducted as described above. Serum potassium levels should be maintained at 4 mEq/L or higher (within normal range) and serum magnesium and serum calcium should be kept within normal range to reduce the risk of electrocardiogram QT prolongation. Avoid using vandetanib with drugs known to prolong the electrocardiogram QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.3)]. If such drugs are given to patients already receiving vandetanib and no alternative therapy exists, ECG monitoring of the QT interval should be performed more frequently. Patients who develop a QTcF greater than 500 ms should stop taking vandetanib until QTcF returns to less than 450 ms. Dosing of vandetanib can be resumed at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.2 Skin Reactions and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Severe skin reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), some leading to death, have been reported with vandetanib. Treatment of severe skin reactions has included systemic corticosteroids and permanent discontinuation of vandetanib. Mild to moderate skin reactions may manifest as rash, acne, dry skin, dermatitis, pruritis and other skin reactions (including photosensitivity reactions and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome). Mild to moderate skin reactions have been treated with topical and systemic corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, and topical and systemic antibiotics. If CTCAE grade 3 or greater skin reactions occur, vandetanib treatment should be stopped until improved. Upon improvement, consideration should be given to continuing treatment at a reduced dose or permanent discontinuation of vandetanib. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] Photosensitivity reactions are increased with vandetanib. Patients should be advised to wear sunscreen and protective clothing when exposed to the sun. Due to the long half-life of vandetanib, protective clothing and sunscreen should continue for 4 months after discontinuation of treatment. 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or pneumonitis has been observed with vandetanib and deaths have been reported. Consider a diagnosis of ILD in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough, or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic, and other causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of ILD and have few or no symptoms may continue vandetanib therapy with close monitoring at the discretion of the treating physician. If symptoms are moderate, consider interrupting therapy until symptoms improve. The use of corticosteroids and antibiotics may be indicated. For cases where symptoms of ILD are severe, discontinue vandetanib therapy and the use of corticosteroids and antibiotics may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. Even upon resolution of severe ILD, permanent discontinuation of vandetanib should be considered. 5.4 Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events Ischemic cerebrovascular events have been observed with vandetanib and some cases have been fatal. In the randomized medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) study, ischemic cerebrovascular events were observed more frequently with vandetanib compared to placebo (1.3% compared to 0%) and no deaths were reported. The safety of resumption of vandetanib therapy after resolution of an ischemic cerebrovascular event has not been studied. Discontinue vandetanib in patients who experience a severe ischemic cerebrovascular event. 5.5 Hemorrhage Serious hemorrhagic events, which in some cases were fatal, have been observed with vandetanib. There were no fatal bleeding events in the randomized MTC study. Three patients died of fatal bleeding events while on vandetanib therapy in clinical studies. Do not administer vandetanib to patients with recent history of hemoptysis of >= 1/2 teaspoon of red blood. Discontinue vandetanib in patients with severe hemorrhage. 5.6 Heart Failure Heart failure has been observed with vandetanib and some cases have been fatal. Discontinuation of vandetanib may be necessary in patients with heart failure. Heart failure may not be reversible upon stopping vandetanib. Monitor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. 5.7 Diarrhea Diarrhea was observed in patients who received vandetanib. Routine anti-diarrheal agents are recommended. Diarrhea may cause electrolyte imbalances. Since QT prolongation is seen with vandetanib, serum electrolytes and ECGs should be carefully monitored in patients with diarrhea. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] If severe diarrhea develops, vandetanib treatment should be stopped until diarrhea improves. Upon improvement, treatment with vandetanib should be resumed at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.8 Hypothyroidism In the randomized MTC study where 90% of the patients enrolled had prior thyroidectomy, increases in the dose of the thyroid replacement therapy were required in 49% of the patients randomized to vandetanib compared to 17% of the patients randomized to placebo. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be obtained at baseline, at 2 to 4 weeks and 8 to 12 weeks after starting treatment with vandetanib and every 3 months thereafter. If signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism occur, thyroid hormone levels should be examined and thyroid replacement therapy should be adjusted accordingly. 5.9 Hypertension Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been observed with vandetanib. All patients should be monitored for hypertension and it should be controlled as appropriate. Dose reduction or interruption may be necessary. If high blood pressure cannot be controlled, vandetanib should not be restarted [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.10 Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by an MRI of the brain, has been observed with vandetanib. This syndrome should be considered in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. In clinical studies, three of four patients who developed RPLS while taking vandetanib, including one pediatric patient, also had hypertension. Discontinuation of vandetanib treatment in patients with RPLS should be considered. 5.11 Drug Interactions The administration of vandetanib with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. The administration of vandetanib with anti-arrhythmic drugs (including, but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, sotalol, dofetilide) and other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (including but not limited to cloroquine, clarithromycin, dolasetron, granisetron, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, and pimozide) should be avoided [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.12 Renal Impairment Vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function. The starting dose should be reduced to 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and QT interval should be monitored closely. There is no information available for patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.4)and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] 5.13 Hepatic Impairment Vandetanib is not recommended for use in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, as safety and efficacy have not been established. [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] 5.14 Use in Pregnancy Vandetanib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using vandetanib. In nonclinical studies in rats, vandetanib was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic, at exposures equivalent to or lower than those expected at the recommended human dose of 300 mg/day. As expected from its pharmacological actions, vandetanib has shown significant effects on all stages of female reproduction in rats. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with vandetanib. Women should be advised that they must use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment and for at least four months following the last dose of vandetanib [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.15 Vandetanib REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program Because of the risk of QT prolongation, Torsades de pointes, and sudden death, vandetanib is available only through a restricted distribution program called Vandetanib REMS Program. Only prescribers and pharmacies certified with the program are able to prescribe and dispense vandetanib. An overview of the requirements for prescribers and pharmacies is included below. To be certified, prescribers must review the educational materials, agree to comply with the REMS requirements and enroll in the program. To be certified, pharmacies that dispense vandetanib must enroll in the program, train their pharmacy staff to verify that each prescription is written by a certified prescriber before dispensing to a patient, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. To learn about the specific REMS requirements and to enroll in the Vandetanib REMS Program call 1-800-236-9933 or visit www.vandetanibrems.com."
