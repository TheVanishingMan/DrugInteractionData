        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Acebutolol is well tolerated in properly selected patients. Most adverse reactions have been mild, not required discontinuation of therapy, and tended to decrease as duration of treatment increases. The following table shows the frequency of treatment-related side effects derived from controlled clinical trials in patients with hypertension, angina pectoris, and arrhythmia. These patients received acebutolol, propranolol, or hydrochlorothiazide as monotherapy, or placebo. The following selected (potentially important) side effects were seen in up to 2% of acebutolol patients: Cardiovascular: hypotension, bradycardia, heart failure. Central Nervous System: anxiety, hyper/hypoesthesia, impotence. Dermatological: pruritus. Gastrointestinal: vomiting, abdominal pain. Genitourinary: dysuria, nocturia. Liver and Biliary System: A small number of cases of liver abnormalities (increased SGOT, SGPT, LDH) have been reported in association with acebutolol therapy. In some cases increased bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase, fever, malaise, dark urine, anorexia, nausea, headache, and/or other symptoms have been reported. In some of the reported cases, the symptoms and signs were confirmed by rechallenge with acebutolol. The abnormalities were reversible upon cessation of acebutolol therapy. Musculoskeletal: back pain, joint pain. Respiratory: pharyngitis, wheezing. Special Senses: conjunctivitis, dry eye, eye pain. Autoimmune: In extremely rare instances, systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported. The incidence of drug-related adverse effects (volunteered and solicited) according to acebutolol dose is shown below. (Data from 266 hypertensive patients treated for 3 months on a constant dose.) POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS In addition, certain adverse effects not listed above have been reported with other β-blocking agents and should also be considered as potential adverse effects of acebutolol. Central Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia (an acute syndrome characterized by disorientation for time and place), short-term memory loss, emotional lability, slightly clouded sensorium, and decreased performance (neuropsychometrics). Cardiovascular: Intensification of AV block (see Contraindications). Allergic: Erythematous rash, fever combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress. Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic, and thrombocytopenic purpura. Gastrointestinal: Mesenteric arterial thrombosis and ischemic colitis. Miscellaneous: Reversible alopecia and Peyronie's disease. The oculomucocutaneous syndrome associated with the β-blocker practolol has not been reported with acebutolol during investigational use and extensive foreign clinical experience."

        "Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine, may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with acebutolol plus catecholamine depletors should, therefore, be observed closely for evidence of marked bradycardia or hypotension which may present as vertigo, syncope/presyncope, or orthostatic changes in blood pressure without compensatory tachycardia. Exaggerated hypertensive responses have been reported from the combined use of beta-adrenergic antagonists and alpha-adrenergic stimulants, including those contained in proprietary cold remedies and vasoconstrictive nasal drops. Patients receiving beta-blockers should be warned of this potential hazard. Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported. No significant interactions with digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine, sulfinpyrazone, oral contraceptives, tolbutamide, or warfarin have been observed. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia."
