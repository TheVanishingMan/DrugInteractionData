Nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients, predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Cardiovascular: Vasoconstrictive complications of a serious nature may occur at times. These include ischemia, cyanosis, absence of pulse, cold extremities, gangrene, precordial distress and pain, EKG changes and muscle pains. Although these effects occur most commonly with long-term therapy at relatively high doses, they have also been reported with short-term or normal doses. Other cardiovascular adverse effects include transient tachycardia or bradycardia and hypertension. Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting; rectal or anal ulcer (from overuse of suppositories). Neurological: paresthesias, numbness, weakness, and vertigo. Allergic: Localized edema and itching. Fibrotic Complications: (see WARNINGS)."
