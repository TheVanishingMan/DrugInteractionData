        "Drug Interactions Drugs that affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of ketoconazole may alter the plasma concentrations of ketoconazole. For example, gastric acid suppressants (e.g., antacids, histamine H2-blockers, proton pump inhibitors) have been shown to reduce plasma concentrations of ketoconazole.Ketoconazole is a substrate and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, the following drug interactions may occur when ketoconazole is co-administered with other drugs that interact with CYP3A4. (See Table 1 and Table 2 for an overview of these drug interactions; details are provided in the text that follows these tables.) Ketoconazole may decrease the elimination of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, thereby increasing their plasma concentrations. Increased exposure to these drugs may cause an increase or prolongation of their therapeutic and/or adverse effects. Concomitant use with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated for drugs known to present a risk of serious side effects with increased exposure (see BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS section, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, Table 1). For others, monitoring of plasma concentrations is advised when possible. Clinical signs and symptoms associated with these drugs should be monitored, with dosage adjusted as needed. Inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the plasma concentrations of ketoconazole (see Table 2). Ketoconazole may not be effective in patients concomitantly taking one of these drugs. Therefore, administration of these drugs with ketoconazole is not recommended. Other inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the plasma concentrations of ketoconazole (see Table 2). Patients who must take ketoconazole concomitantly with one of these drugs should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole. Table 1. Selected Drugs That Have Been Shown To or Are Predicted To Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered By KetoconazoleThis list is not all-inclusive. Systemic exposure to these drugs is increased significantly by the addition of ketoconazole: Concomitant use with ketoconazole is contraindicated. Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin) Cisapride Nisoldipine Dofetilide Pimozide Eplerenone Quinidine Ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) Systemic exposure to these drugs is increased by ketoconazole: Careful monitoring, with possible adjustment in dosage, is recommended. Alfentanil, fentanyl, sulfentanil Indinavir, saquinavir Amlodipine, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine Methylprednisolone Bosentan Rifabutin Buspirone Sildenafil Busulfan Sirolimus (co-administration not recommended) Carbamazepine Tacrolimus Cilostazol Telithromycin Cyclosporine Tolterodine Digoxin Trimetrexate Docetaxel, paclitaxel Verapamil Oral anti-coagulants Vinca alkaloids (vincristine, - vinblastine, vinorelbine) Table 2. Selected Drugs That Have Been Shown To or Are Predicted To Alter The Plasma Concentration Of Ketoconazole *This list is not all-inclusive. Systemic exposure to ketoconazole is reduced significantly by these drugs: Concomitant use with ketoconazole is not recommended. Carbamazepine Phenytoin Gastric Acid Suppressants (antacids, antimuscarinics, histamine H2-blockers, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate) Rifampin, rifabutin, isoniazid Nevirapine Systemic exposure to ketoconazole is increased significantly by this drug: Dose reduction of ketoconazole should be considered Ritonavir 1. Effects of ketoconazole on other drugs 1.1 Systemic exposure to the following drugs is significantly increased by coadministration of ketoconazole. Concomitant use of these drugs with ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg is contraindicated Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam Co-administration of ketoconazole tablets with alprazolam, midazolam, or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with alprazolam, oral midazolam, and oral triazolam is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections.) Special precaution and patient monitoring are required with concomitant parenteral midazolam, because the sedative effect may be prolonged. Cisapride Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to prolongation of QT interval. Therefore concomitant administration of ketaconazole tablets with cisapride is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Dofetilide The class III antiarrhythmic dofetilide is known to prolong the QT interval. The potential increase in dofetilide plasma concentrations when administered concomitantly with ketoconazole could result in serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes. Therefore, concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with dofetilide is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Eplerenone Ketoconazole increases the eplerenone AUC by roughly 5-fold, thereby increasing the risk for hyperkalemia and hypotension. Co-administration of ketoconazole and eplerenone is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS section.) Ergot Alkaloids Elevated concentrations of ergot alkaloids can cause ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS section.) HMG-CoA Enzyme Inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin) Co-administration of ketoconazole with CYP3A4-metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin, may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections.) Nisoldipine Pre-treatment with and concomitant administration of ketoconazole resulted in a 24-fold and 11-fold increase in mean AUC and Cmax of nisoldipine, respectively, compared with treatment with nisoldipine 5 mg alone. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole with nisoldipine is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS section.) Pimozide Pimozide is known to prolong the QT interval and is partially metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of ketoconazole and pimozide could result in serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes, and is therefore contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Quinidine The class IA antiarhythmic quinidine is known to prolong the QT interval. The potential increase in quinidine plasma concentrations when administered concomitantly with ketoconazole could result in serious cardiovascular events including QTc prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes. Therefore, concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with quinidine is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) 1.2 Co-administration of ketoconazole with the following agents was shown or is expected to result in increased exposure to these drugs. Therefore, careful monitoring of plasma concentrations or adverse events of these drugs is recommended. Adjustment of dosage of these drugs may be needed Alfentanil, sufentanil, fentanyl In vitro data suggest that alfentanil, sufentanil and fentanyl are metabolized by CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets and alfentanil, sufentanil, or fentanyl may increase plasma concentrations of the latter drugs. Amlodipine, felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine CYP3A4 metabolized calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, felodipine, nicardipine, and nifedipine should be used cautiously with ketoconazole tablets as ketoconazole may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these calcium channel blockers. Bosentan Concomitant administration of ketoconazole increased the Cmax and AUC of bosentan 2.1- and 2.3 - fold, respectively. No dosage adjustment of bosentan is needed but close monitoring for increased bosentan-associated adverse effects is recommended. Buspirone Concomitant administration of buspirone with ketoconazole may result in significant increases in plasma concentrations of buspirone. When administered with ketoconazole tablets, a low initial dose of buspirone with subsequent dosage adjustment based on clinical assessment is recommended. Busulfan Ketoconazole tablets may decrease the clearance and thus increase the systemic exposure to busulfan. Carbamazepine In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. Close monitoring of plasma carbamazepine concentrations is recommended whenever ketoconazole is given to patients stabilized on carbamazepine therapy. Cilostazol Ketoconazole had been shown to increase both cilostazol AUC and Cmax by about two-fold when administered concurrently. Co-administration of ketoconazole with cilostazol resulted in increased incidences of adverse effects, such as headache. When ketoconazole tablets is administered concomitantly with cilostazol, the prescriber should consider up to a 50% reduction in cilostazol dosage. Cyclosporine Ketoconazole tablets may alter the metabolism of cyclosporine, thereby resulting in elevated cyclosporine plasma concentrations. Dosage adjustment may be required if cyclosporine or tacrolimus is given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets. Digoxin Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Docetaxel In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. When docetaxel and ketoconazole are administered together, dosage reduction in docetaxel may be necessary in order to minimize the incidence of toxicities associated with docetaxel. Indinavir, saquinavir Concomitant administration of ketoconazole and protease inhibitors metabolized by CYP3A4, such as indinavir and saquinavir, may increase plasma concentrations of these protease inhibitors. Dosage reduction of indinavir is recommended when administering ketoconazole concomitantly. No dosage adjustments are recommended when saquinavir and ketoconazole are coadministered for a short period of time. Methylprednisolone Ketoconazole tablets may alter the metabolism of methylprednisolone, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of methylprednisolone. Dose adjustments may be required if methylprednisolone is given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets. Oral anti-coagulants Oral imidazole compounds such as ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Oral hypoglycemic agents Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral miconazole (an imidazole) and oral hypoglycemic agents, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) cannot be ruled out. Rifabutin Ketoconazole was shown to inhibit the CYP-mediated metabolism of rifabutin in vitro. Co-administration with ketoconazole tablets may result in elevated plasma concentrations of rifabutin. Sildenafil Ketoconazole had been shown to increase sildenafil plasma concentrations. When used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets, a 50% reduction in sildenafil starting dose should be considered. Sirolimus Multiple-dose ketoconazole had been shown to increase sirolimus Cmax and AUC by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively. The concomitant use of ketoconazole tablets and sirolimus is not recommended. Tacrolimus Ketoconazole had been shown to decrease the oral clearance of tacrolimus thereby leading to a 2-fold increase in tacrolimus oral bioavailability. Adjustment in tacrolimus dosage may be required if tacrolimus is given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets. Telithromycin Ketoconazole increased the AUC of telithromycin by 1.5 to 2-fold. Use caution when administering telithromycin concurrently with ketoconazole tablets since this may result in an increased risk for telithromycin associated adverse events. Tolterodine In the presence of ketoconazole, the apparent oral clearance of tolterodine decreased resulting in at least a two-fold increase in tolterodine. For patients receiving ketoconazole, a 50% reduction in the initial tolterodine dosage is recommended. Trimetrexate In vitro data suggest that trimetrexate is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro animal models have demonstrated that ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of trimetrexate. Patients treated concomitantly with trimetrexate and ketoconazole tablets should be carefully monitored for trimetrexate-associated toxicities. Verapamil Findings of in vitro metabolic studies indicate that verapamil is metabolized by enzymes including CYP3A4. Ketoconazole may increase verapamil serum concentrations. Caution should be taken when co-administering verapamil with ketoconazole tablets. Vinca Alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine) Ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of vinca alkaloids metabolized by CYP3A4. Close monitoring for toxicities associated with vincristine, vinblastine, or vinorelbine is recommended when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets. 2. Effects of other drugs on ketoconazole 2.1 Drugs affecting the absorption of ketoconazole Gastric Acid Suppressors/Neutralizers Studies have shown that absorption of ketoconazole is impaired when gastric acid production is decreased. Reduced plasma concentrations of ketoconazole were reported when ketoconazole tablets were administered with antacids, antimuscarinics, histamine H2-blockers, proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole) and sucralfate. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions (General) section.) 2.2 Drugs that were shown or are expected to significantly reduce the systemic exposure to ketoconazole Co-administration of ketoconazole with potent CYP3A4 enzyme inducers is not recommended. Carbamazepine Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with carbamazepine may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs. Close monitoring for both plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and reduced ketoconazole efficacy is recommended. Nevirapine Ketoconazole AUC and Cmax decreased by a median of 63% and 40%, respectively, in HIV-infected patients who were given nevirapine 200 mg once daily for two weeks along with ketoconazole 400 mg daily. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets and nevirapine is not recommended. Phenytoin Concomitant administration of ketoconazole with phenytoin may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs. Close monitoring for both plasma concentrations of phenytoin and reduced efficacy of ketoconazole tablets is recommended. Rifampin, rifabutin, isoniazid Concomitant administration of rifampin and rifabutin with ketoconazole tablets reduces the blood concentrations of the latter. INH (Isoniazid) was also reported to affect ketoconazole concentrations adversely. These antitubercular drugs should not be given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets. 2.3 Drugs that significantly increase the systemic exposure to ketoconazole Ritonavir Concomitant administration of ritonavir with ketoconazole tablets increases was shown to increase the oral bioavailability of ketoconazole. Therefore, when ritonavir is to be given concomitantly, higher doses (>200 mg/day) of ketoconazole tablets should not be used. 3. Other drug interactions Alcohol Rare cases of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol have been reported. These experiences have been characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea, and headache. Symptoms resolved within a few hours. Loratadine After the co-administration of 200 mg oral ketoconazole twice daily and one 20 mg dose of loratadine to 11 subjects, the AUC and Cmax of loratadine averaged 302% (±142 S.D.) and 251% (± 68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after cotreatment with placebo. The AUC and Cmax of descarboethoxyloratadine, an active metabolite, averaged 155% (± 27 S.D.) and 141% (± 35 S.D.), respectively. However, no related changes were noted in the QTc on ECG taken at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the coadministration. Also, there were no clinically significant differences in adverse events when loratadine was administered with or without ketoconazole."

        "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary. The following drug interactions have been identified involving ketoconazole tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Ketoconazole tablets inhibit the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite. The increased plasma concentration of terfenadine or its metabolite may result in prolonged QT intervals. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of astemizole, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals. Coadministration of astemizole with ketoconazole tablets is therefore contraindicated. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride. Data suggest that coadministration of oral ketoconazole and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. Therefore concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with cisapride is contraindicated. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Ketoconazole tablets may alter the metabolism of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and methylprednisolone, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter drugs. Dosage adjustment may be required if cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or methylprednisolone are given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with midazolam or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. These agents should not be used in patients treated with ketoconazole tablets. If midazolam is administered parenterally, special precaution is required since the sedative effect may be prolonged. Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentration in patients receiving ketoconazole. When taken orally, imidazole compounds like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs. In simultaneous treatment with imidazole drugs and coumarin drugs, the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral miconazole (an imidazole) and oral hypoglycemic agents, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) can not be ruled out. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with phenytoin may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs. It is suggested to monitor both ketoconazole and phenytoin. Concomitant administration of rifampin with ketoconazole tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter. INH (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect ketoconazole concentrations adversely. These drugs should not be given concomitantly. After the coadministration of 200 mg oral ketoconazole twice daily and one 20 mg dose of loratadine to 11 subjects, the AUC and Cmax of loratadine averaged 302% (± 142 S.D.) and 251% (± 68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo. The AUC and Cmax of descarboethoxyloratadine, an active metabolite, averaged 155% (± 27 S.D.) and 141% (± 35 S.D.), respectively. However, no related changes were noted in the QTc on ECG taken at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the coadministration. Also, there were no clinically significant differences in adverse events when loratadine was administered with or without ketoconazole. Rare cases of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol have been reported. These experiences have been characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea, and headache. Symptoms resolved within a few hours."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In rare cases, anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported. However, the most frequent adverse reactions were nausea and/or vomiting in approximately 3%, abdominal pain in 1.2%, pruritus in 1.5%, and the following in less than 1% of the patients: headache, dizziness, somnolence, fever and chills, photophobia, diarrhea, gynecomastia, impotence, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and bulging fontanelles. Oligospermia has been reported in investigational studies with the drug at dosages above those currently approved. Oligospermia has not been reported at dosages up to 400 mg daily, however sperm counts have been obtained infrequently in patients treated with these dosages. Most of these reactions were mild and transient and rarely required discontinuation of ketoconazole tablets. In contrast, the rare occurrences of hepatic dysfunction require special attention (see WARNINGS section). In worldwide postmarketing experience with ketoconazole tablets there have been rare reports of alopecia, paresthesia, and signs of increased intracranial pressure including bulging fontanelles and papilledema. Hypertriglyceridemia has also been reported but a causal association with ketoconazole is uncertain. Neuropsychiatric disturbances, including suicidal tendencies and severe depression, have occurred rarely in patients using ketoconazole tablets. Ventricular dysrhythmias (prolonged QT intervals) have occurred with the concomitant use of terfenadine with ketoconazole tablets. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Data suggest that coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval and has rarely been associated with ventricular arrhythmias. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS sections.)"

        "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary. The following drug interactions have been identified involving ketoconazole tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Ketoconazole tablets inhibit the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite. The increased plasma concentration of terfenadine or its metabolite may result in prolonged QT intervals. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of astemizole, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals. Coadministration of astemizole with ketoconazole tablets is therefore contraindicated. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride. Data suggest that coadministration of oral ketoconazole and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. Therefore concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with cisapride is contraindicated. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections.) Ketoconazole tablets may alter the metabolism of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and methylprednisolone, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter drugs. Dosage adjustment may be required if cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or methylprednisolone are given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with midazolam or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. These agents should not be used in patients treated with ketoconazole tablets. If midazolam is administered parenterally, special precaution is required since the sedative effect may be prolonged. Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. When taken orally, imidazole compounds like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs.

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary. The following drug interactions have been identified involving ketoconazole tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Ketoconazole tablets inhibit the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite. The increased plasma concentration of terfenadine or its metabolite may result in prolonged QT intervals. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of astemizole, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals. Coadministration of astemizole with ketoconazole tablets is therefore contraindicated. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride. Data suggest that coadministration of oral ketoconazole and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. Therefore concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with cisapride is contraindicated. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections.) Ketoconazole tablets may alter the metabolism of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and methylprednisolone, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter drugs. Dosage adjustment may be required if cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or methylprednisolone are given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with midazolam or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. These agents should not be used in patients treated with ketoconazole tablets. If midazolam is administered parenterally, special precaution is required since the sedative effect may be prolonged. Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. When taken orally, imidazole compounds like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs. In simultaneous treatment with imidazole drugs and coumarin drugs, the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral miconazole (an imidazole) and oral hypoglycemic agents, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) can not be ruled out. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with phenytoin may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs. It is suggested to monitor both ketoconazole and phenytoin. Concomitant administration of rifampin with ketoconazole tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter. INH (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect ketoconazole concentrations adversely. These drugs should not be given concomitantly. After the coadministration of 200 mg oral ketoconazole twice daily and one 20 mg dose of loratadine to 11 subjects, the AUC and Cmax of loratadine averaged 302% (± 142 S.D.) and 251% (± 68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo. The AUC and Cmax of descarboethoxyloratadine, an active metabolite, averaged 155% (± 27 S.D.) and 141% (± 35 S.D.), respectively. However, no related changes were noted in the QTc on ECG taken at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the coadministration. Also, there were no clinically significant differences in adverse events when loratadine was administered with or without ketoconazole. Rare cases of disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol have been reported. These experiences have been characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea, and headache. Symptoms resolved within a few hours."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In rare cases, anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported. However, the most frequent adverse reactions were nausea and/or vomiting in approximately 3%, abdominal pain in 1.2%, pruritus in 1.5%, and the following in less than 1% of the patients: headache, dizziness, somnolence, fever and chills, photophobia, diarrhea, gynecomastia, impotence, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and bulging fontanelles. Oligospermia has been reported in investigational studies with the drug at dosages above those currently approved. Oligospermia has not been reported at dosages up to 400 mg daily, however sperm counts have been obtained infrequently in patients treated with these dosages. Most of these reactions were mild and transient and rarely required discontinuation of ketoconazole tablets. In contrast, the rare occurrences of hepatic dysfunction require special attention (see WARNINGS section). In worldwide postmarketing experience with ketoconazole tablets there have been rare reports of alopecia, paresthesia, and signs of increased intracranial pressure including bulging fontanelles and papilledema. Hypertriglyceridemia has also been reported but a causal association with ketoconazole is uncertain. Neuropsychiatric disturbances, including suicidal tendencies and severe depression, have occurred rarely in patients using ketoconazole tablets. Ventricular dysrhythmias (prolonged QT intervals) have occurred with the concomitant use of terfenadine with ketoconazole tablets. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.)

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions observed in clinical studies (incidence >1%) were application site burning and application site reaction (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or www.perrigo.com and FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse reactions that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. The safety data presented in Table 1 (below) reflect exposure to ketoconazole foam, 2% in 672 subjects, 12 years and older with seborrheic dermatitis. Subjects applied ketoconazole foam, 2% or vehicle foam twice daily for 4 weeks to affected areas on the face, scalp, and/or chest. Adverse reactions occurring in > 1% of subjects are presented in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported by >1% Subjects in Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions Ketoconazole Foam, 2% N=672 n (%) Vehicle Foam N=497 n (%) Subjects with an Adverse Reaction 188 (28%) 122 (25%) Application site burning 67 (10%) 49 (10%) Application site reaction 41 (6%) 24 (5%) Application site reactions that were reported in <=1% of subjects were dryness, erythema, irritation, paresthesia, pruritus, rash and warmth. 6.2 Dermal Safety Studies In a photoallergenicity study, 9 of 53 subjects (17%) had reactions during the challenge period at both the irradiated and non-irradiated sites treated with ketoconazole foam, 2%. Ketoconazole Foam, 2% may cause contact sensitization."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary. The following drug interactions have been identified involving ketoconazole tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Ketoconazole tablets inhibit the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite. The increased plasma concentration of terfenadine or its metabolite may result in prolonged QT intervals. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of astemizole, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals. Coadministration of astemizole with ketoconazole tablets is therefore contraindicated. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Human pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole potentially inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride. Data suggest that coadministration of oral ketoconazole and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. Therefore concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with cisapride is contraindicated. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Ketoconazole tablets may alter the metabolism of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and methylprednisolone, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter drugs. Dosage adjustment may be required if cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or methylprednisolone are given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with midazolam and triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. These agents should not be used in patients treated with ketoconazole tablets. If midazolam is administered parenterally, special precaution is required since the sedative effect may be prolonged. Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. When taken orally, imidazole compounds like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs. In simultaneous treatment with imidazole drugs and coumarin drugs, the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral miconazole (an imidazole) and oral hypoglycemic agents, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) can not be ruled out. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with phenytoin may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs. It is suggested to monitor both ketoconazole and phenytoin. Concomitant administration of rifampin with ketoconazole tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter. INH (isoniazid) is also reported to affect ketoconazole concentrations adversely. These drugs should not be given concomitantly. After the coadministration of 200 mg oral ketoconazole twice daily and one 20 mg dose of loratadine to 11 subjects, the AUC and Cmax of loratadine averaged 302% (± 142 S.D.) and 251% (± 68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo. The AUC and Cmax of descarboethoxyloratadine, an active metabolite, averaged 155% (± 27 S.D.) and 141% (± 35 S.D.), respectively. However, no related changes were noted in the QTc on ECG taken at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the coadministration. Also, there were no clinically significant differences in adverse events when loratadine was administered with or without ketoconazole. Rare cases of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol have been reported. These experiences have been characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea, and headache. Symptoms resolved within a few hours."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In rare cases, anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported. However, the most frequent adverse reactions were nausea and/or vomiting in approximately 3%, abdominal pain in 1.2%, pruritus in 1.5%, and the following in less than 1% of the patients: headache, dizziness, somnolence, fever and chills, photophobia, diarrhea, gynecomastia, impotence, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and bulging fontanelles. Oligospermia has been reported in investigational studies with the drug at dosages above those currently approved. Oligospermia has not been reported at dosages up to 400 mg daily, however sperm counts have been obtained infrequently in patients treated with these dosages. Most of these reactions were mild and transient and rarely required discontinuation of ketoconazole tablets. In contrast, the rare occurrences of hepatic dysfunction require special attention (see WARNINGS section). In worldwide postmarketing experience with ketoconazole tablets there have been rare reports of alopecia, paresthesia, and signs of increased intracranial pressure including bulging fontanelles and papilledema. Hypertriglyceridemia has also been reported but a causal association with ketoconazole is uncertain. Neuropsychiatric disturbances, including suicidal tendencies and severe depression, have occurred rarely in patients using ketoconazole tablets. Ventricular dysrhythmias (prolonged QT intervals) have occurred with the concomitant use of terfenadine with ketoconazole tablets. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Data suggest that coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval and has rarely been associated with ventricular arrhythmias. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS sections.)"

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary. The following drug interactions have been identified involving ketoconazole tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Ketoconazole tablets inhibit the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite. The increased plasma concentration of terfenadine or its metabolite may result in prolonged QT intervals. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of astemizole, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals. Coadministration of astemizole with ketoconazole tablets is therefore contraindicated. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride. Data suggest that coadministration of oral ketoconazole and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. Therefore concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with cisapride is contraindicated. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections.) Ketoconazole tablets may alter the metabolism of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and methylprednisolone, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter drugs. Dosage adjustment may be required if cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or methylprednisolone are given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with midazolam or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. These agents should not be used in patients treated with ketoconazole tablets. If midazolam is administered parenterally, special precaution is required since the sedative effect may be prolonged. Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. When taken orally, imidazole compounds like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs. In simultaneous treatment with imidazole drugs and coumarin drugs, the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral miconazole (an imidazole) and oral hypoglycemic agents, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) can not be ruled out. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with phenytoin may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs. It is suggested to monitor both ketoconazole and phenytoin. Concomitant administration of rifampin with ketoconazole tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter. INH (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect ketoconazole concentrations adversely. These drugs should not be given concomitantly. After the coadministration of 200 mg oral ketoconazole twice daily and one 20 mg dose of loratadine to 11 subjects, the AUC and Cmax of loratadine averaged 302% (± 142 S.D.) and 251% (± 68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo. The AUC and Cmax of descarboethoxyloratadine, an active metabolite, averaged 155% (± 27 S.D.) and 141% (± 35 S.D.), respectively. However, no related changes were noted in the QTc on ECG taken at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the coadministration. Also, there were no clinically significant differences in adverse events when loratadine was administered with or without ketoconazole. Rare cases of disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol have been reported. These experiences have been characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea, and headache. Symptoms resolved within a few hours."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In rare cases, anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported. However, the most frequent adverse reactions were nausea and/or vomiting in approximately 3%, abdominal pain in 1.2%, pruritus in 1.5%, and the following in less than 1% of the patients: headache, dizziness, somnolence, fever and chills, photophobia, diarrhea, gynecomastia, impotence, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and bulging fontanelles. Oligospermia has been reported in investigational studies with the drug at dosages above those currently approved. Oligospermia has not been reported at dosages up to 400 mg daily, however sperm counts have been obtained infrequently in patients treated with these dosages. Most of these reactions were mild and transient and rarely required discontinuation of ketoconazole tablets. In contrast, the rare occurrences of hepatic dysfunction require special attention (see WARNINGS section). In worldwide postmarketing experience with ketoconazole tablets there have been rare reports of alopecia, paresthesia, and signs of increased intracranial pressure including bulging fontanelles and papilledema. Hypertriglyceridemia has also been reported but a causal association with ketoconazole is uncertain. Neuropsychiatric disturbances, including suicidal tendencies and severe depression, have occurred rarely in patients using ketoconazole tablets. Ventricular dysrhythmias (prolonged QT intervals) have occurred with the concomitant use of terfenadine with ketoconazole tablets. (See BOX WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS sections.) Data suggest that coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval and has rarely been associated with ventricular arrhythmias. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS sections.)"

In three open-label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4-10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported.

The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. In worldwide experience with ketoconazole shampoo, 2% there have been reports of hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, itching, skin burning sensation, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary. The following drug interactions have been identified involving ketoconazole tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Ketoconazole tablets inhibit the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite. The increased plasma concentration of terfenadine or its metabolite may result in prolonged QT intervals. (SeeBOX WARNING,CONTRAINDICATIONS, andWARNINGSsections.) Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of astemizole, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals. Coadministration of astemizole with ketoconazole tablets is therefore contraindicated. (SeeBOX WARNING,CONTRAINDICATIONS, andWARNINGSsections.) Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride. Data suggest that coadministration of oral ketoconazole and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. Therefore concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with cisapride is contraindicated. (SeeBOX WARNING,CONTRAINDICATIONS, andWARNINGSsections.) Ketoconazole tablets may alter the metabolism of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and methylprednisolone, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter drugs. Dosage adjustment may be required if cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or methylprednisolone are given concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with midazolam or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. These agents should not be used in patients treated with ketoconazole tablets. If midazolam is administered parenterally, special precaution is required since the sedative effect may be prolonged. Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentration in patients receiving ketoconazole. When taken orally, imidazole compounds like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs. In simultaneous treatment with imidazole drugs and coumarin drugs, the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral miconazole (an imidazole) and oral hypoglycemic agents, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) can not be ruled out. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with phenytoin may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs. It is suggested to monitor both ketoconazole and phenytoin. Concomitant administration of rifampin with ketoconazole tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter. INH (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect ketoconazole concentrations adversely. These drugs should not be given concomitantly. After the coadministration of 200 mg oral ketoconazole twice daily and one 20 mg dose of loratadine to 11 subjects, the AUC and Cmax of loratadine averaged 302% (142 S.D.) and 251% (68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo. The AUC and Cmax of descarboethoxyloratadine, an active metabolite, averaged 155% (27 S.D.) and 141% (35 S.D.), respectively. However, no related changes were noted in the QTc on ECG taken at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the coadministration. Also, there were no clinically significant differences in adverse events when loratadine was administered with or without ketoconazole. Rare cases of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol have been reported. These experiences have been characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea, and headache. Symptoms resolved within a few hours."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In rare cases, anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported. However, the most frequent adverse reactions were nausea and/or vomiting in approximately 3%, abdominal pain in 1.2%, pruritus in 1.5%, and the following in less than 1% of the patients: headache, dizziness, somnolence, fever and chills, photophobia, diarrhea, gynecomastia, impotence, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and bulging fontanelles. Oligospermia has been reported in investigational studies with the drug at dosages above those currently approved. Oligospermia has not been reported at dosages up to 400 mg daily, however sperm counts have been obtained infrequently in patients treated with these dosages. Most of these reactions were mild and transient and rarely required discontinuation of ketoconazole tablets. In contrast, the rare occurrences of hepatic dysfunction require special attention (seeWARNINGSsection). In worldwide postmarketing experience with ketoconazole tablets there have been rare reports of alopecia, paresthesia, and signs of increased intracranial pressure including bulging fontanelles and papilledema. Hypertriglyceridemia has also been reported but a causal association with ketoconazole is uncertain. Neuropsychiatric disturbances, including suicidal tendencies and severe depression, have occurred rarely in patients using ketoconazole tablets. Ventricular dysrhythmias (prolonged QT intervals) have occurred with the concomitant use of terfenadine with ketoconazole tablets. (SeeBOX WARNING,CONTRAINDICATIONS, andWARNINGSsections.) Data suggest that coadministration of ketoconazole tablets and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval and has rarely been associated with ventricular arrhythmias. (SeeCONTRAINDICATIONS,WARNINGS, andPRECAUTIONSsections.)"

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials Experience In 11 double-blind trials in 264 patients using ketoconazole 2% shampoo for the treatment of dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis, an increase in normal hair loss and irritation occurred in less than 1% of patients. In three open-label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4-10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of NIZORAL(R) (ketoconazole) 2% Shampoo (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post-marketing experience with NIZORAL(R) (ketoconazole) Shampoo: there have been reports of hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, itching, skin burning sensation, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions."
