      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Interactions Common for Both Benazepril and Hydrochlorothiazide Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics Concomitant use with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may effect potassium levels. Monitor potassium periodically. Lithium Renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides and increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Monitor lithium levels when used concomitantly with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypertension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). NSAIDs and Cox-2 selective agents In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including benazepril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving benazepril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Benazepril Benazepril has been used concomitantly with beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, calcium-blocking agents, cimetidine, diuretics, digoxin, hydralazine, and naproxen without evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. Interaction studies with warfarin and acenocoumarol have failed to identify any clinically important effects of benazepril on the serum concentrations or clinical effects of these anticoagulants. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide Ion exchange resins: Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Digitalis glycosides Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may predispose the patients to digoxin toxicity. Skeletal muscle relaxants Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. Antidiabetic agents Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drug may be required. Antineoplastic agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics may reduce renal excretion of cytotoxic agents and enhance their myelosuppressive effects. Drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility The bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine, biperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, pro-kinetic drugs may decrease the bioavailability of thiazide diuretics. Cyclosporine Concomitant treatment with diuretics may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications. Alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics Concomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics may potentiate orthostatic hypotension. Pressor amines Hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor amines such as noradrenaline but the clinical significance of this effect is not sufficient to preclude their use."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in over 2,500 patients with hypertension; over 500 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months, and over 200 were treated for more than 1 year. The reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 7% of U.S. patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide and in 4% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide in U.S. studies were cough (1%; see PRECAUTIONS ), \"dizziness\" (1%), headache (0.6%), and fatigue (0.6%). The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide are shown in the table below.

Monotherapy with benazepril has been evaluated for safety in over 6000 patients. In clinical trials, the observed adverse reactions to benazepril were similar to those seen in trials of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide. In post-marketing experience with benazepril, there have been rare reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, pemphigus, and thrombocytopenia. Another potentially important adverse experience, eosinophilic pneumonitis, has been attributed to other ACE inhibitors. Hydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, but there has not been enough systematic collection of data to support an estimate of the frequency of the observed adverse reactions. Within organ-system groups, the reported reactions are listed here in decreasing order of severity, without regard to frequency. Unknown Frequency: small bowel angioedema, anaphylactoid reactions, hyperkalemia, agranulocytosis, neutropenia. Cardiovascular: Orthostatic hypotension (may be potentiated by alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics). Digestive: Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic) (see WARNINGS ), sialadenitis, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, nausea, gastric irritation, constipation, and anorexia. Neurologic: Vertigo, lightheadedness, transient blurred vision, headache, paresthesia, xanthopsia, weakness, and restlessness. Musculoskeletal: Muscle spasm.

        "Drug Interactions Interactions Common for both Benazepril and Hydrochlorothiazide Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics Concomitant use with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may effect potassium levels. Monitor potassium periodically. Lithium Renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides and increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Monitor lithium levels when used concomitantly with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that block the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min). NSAIDs and Cox-2 Selective Agents In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including benazepril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving benazepril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Benazepril Benazepril has been used concomitantly with beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, calcium-blocking agents, cimetidine, diuretics, digoxin, hydralazine and naproxen without evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. Interaction studies with warfarin and acenocoumarol have failed to identify any clinically important effects of benazepril on the serum concentrations or clinical effects of these anticoagulants. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide Ion Exchange Resins Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Digitalis Glycosides Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may predispose the patients to digoxin toxicity. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. Antidiabetic Agents Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drug may be required. Antineoplastic Agents (e.g. Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate) Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics may reduce renal excretion of cytotoxic agents and enhance their myelosuppressive effects. Drugs that Alter Gastrointestinal Motility The bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g. atropine, biperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, pro-kinetic drugs may decrease the bioavailability of thiazide diuretics. Cyclosporin Concomitant treatment with diuretics may increase the risk of hyperuricaemia and gout-type complications. Alcohol, Barbiturates or Narcotics Concomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics may potentiate orthostatic hypotension. Pressor Amines Hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor amines such as noradrenaline but the clinical significance of this effect is not sufficient to preclude their use."

Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. Interaction studies with warfarin and acenocoumarol have failed to identify any clinically important effects of benazepril on the serum concentrations or clinical effects of these anticoagulants. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS ) Hydrochlorothiazide Ion exchange resins: Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Digitalis glycosides Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may predispose the patients to digoxin toxicity. Skeletal muscle relaxants Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives. Antidiabetic agents Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drug may be required. Antineoplastic agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics may reduce renal excretion of cytotoxic agents and enhance their myelosuppressive effects. Drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility The bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics may be increased by anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine, biperiden), apparently due to a decrease in gastrointestinal motility and the stomach emptying rate. Conversely, pro-kinetic drugs may decrease the bioavailability of thiazide diuretics. Cyclosporine Concomitant treatment with diuretics may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications. Alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics Concomitant administration of thiazide diuretics with alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics may potentiate orthostatic hypotension. Pressor amines Hydrochlorothiazide may reduce the response to pressor amines such as noradrenaline but the clinical significance of this effect is not sufficient to preclude their use."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in over 2500 patients with hypertension; over 500 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months, and over 200 were treated for more than 1 year. The reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 7% of U.S. patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and in 4% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in U.S. studies were cough (1.0%; see PRECAUTIONS ), “dizziness” (1.0%), headache (0.6%), and fatigue (0.6%). The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are shown in the table below. Reactions Possibly or Probably Drug Related Patients in U.S. Placebo-Controlled Studies Benazepril Hydrochloride and Placebo Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets N = 665 N = 235 N % N % “Dizziness” 41 6.3 8 3.4 Fatigue 34 5.2 6 2.6 Postural Dizziness 23 3.5 1 0.4 Headache 20 3.1 10 4.3 Cough 14 2.1 3 1.3 Hypertonia 10 1.5 3 1.3 Vertigo 10 1.5 2 0.9 Nausea 9 1.4 2 0.9 Impotence 8 1.2 0 0.0 Somnolence 8 1.2 1 0.4 Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in 0.3% to 1.0% of patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were the following: Cardiovascular Palpitations, flushing. Gastrointestinal Vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, anorexia, and constipation. Neurologic and Psychiatric Insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, libido decrease, dry mouth, taste perversion, and tinnitus. Dermatologic Rash and sweating. Other Urinary frequency, arthralgia, myalgia, asthenia, and pain (including chest pain and abdominal pain). Other adverse experiences reported in 0.3% or more of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets patients in U.S. controlled clinical trials, and rarer events seen in post-marketing experience, were the following; asterisked entries occurred in more than 1% of patients (in some, a causal relationship to benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is uncertain): Cardiovascular Syncope, peripheral vascular disorder, and tachycardia. Body as a Whole Infection, back pain*, flu syndrome*, fever, chills, and neck pain. Dermatologic Photosensitivity and pruritus. Gastrointestinal Gastroenteritis, flatulence, and tooth disorder. Neurologic and Psychiatric Hypesthesia, abnormal vision, abnormal dreams, and retinal disorder. Respiratory Upper respiratory infection*, epistaxis, bronchitis, rhinitis*, sinusitis*, and voice alteration. Other Conjunctivitis, arthritis, urinary tract infection, alopecia, and urinary frequency*. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of either benazepril or hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Benazepril Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, pemphigus, and thrombocytopenia, eosinophilic pneumonitis. Hydrochlorothiazide Digestive Pancreatitis, small bowel angioedema, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic), sialadenitis, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, nausea, gastric irritation, constipation, and anorexia. Neurologic Vertigo, lightheadedness, transient blurred vision, headache, paresthesia, xanthopsia, weakness, and restlessness. Musculoskeletal Muscle spasm. Hematologic Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Metabolic Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and hyperuricemia, pyrexia, asthenia, parathyroid gland changes with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypersensitivity Anaphylactoid reactions, necrotizing angiitis, respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema), purpura, urticaria, rash, and photosensitivity. Skin Erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes See PRECAUTIONS . Creatinine and BUN Minor reversible increases in serum creatinine and BUN were observed in patients with essential hypertension treated with benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Such increases occurred most frequently in patients with renal artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS )."
