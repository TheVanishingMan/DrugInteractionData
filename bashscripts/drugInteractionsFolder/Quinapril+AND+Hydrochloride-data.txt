        "Drug Interactions Concomitant diuretic therapy As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with quinapril hydrochloride tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with quinapril hydrochloride tablets may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with quinapril hydrochloride tablets. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Agents increasing serum potassium Quinapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. If concomitant therapy of quinapril hydrochloride tablets with potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes is indicated, they should be used with caution along with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see ). PRECAUTIONS Tetracycline and other drugs that interact with magnesium Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril hydrochloride tablets reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril hydrochloride tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril hydrochloride and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Other agents Drug interaction studies of quinapril hydrochloride with other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril hydrochloride tablets. The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice-daily. Quinapril hydrochloride tablet treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of atorvastatin with 80 mg of quinapril hydrochloride resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril hydrochloride tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with Quinapril hydrochloride tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with quinapril hydrochloride tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m ). 2"

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril hydrochloride tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with Quinapril hydrochloride tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with quinapril hydrochloride tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2)."

        "Drug Interactions Concomitant diuretic therapy As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with ACCUPRIL. The possibility of hypotensive effects with ACCUPRIL may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with ACCUPRIL. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Agents increasing serum potassium Quinapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. If concomitant therapy of ACCUPRIL with potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes is indicated, they should be used with caution along with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). Tetracycline and other drugs that interact with magnesium Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with ACCUPRIL reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in ACCUPRIL tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing ACCUPRIL and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy.

        "Drug Interactions Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: As noted above ("Derangements of Serum Electrolytes"), the net effect of Quinapril Hydrochloride and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with Quinapril Hydrochloride and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Quinapril Hydrochloride and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Tetracycline and Other Drugs That Interact with Magnesium: Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Other Agents: Drug interaction studies of quinapril and other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril. The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice daily. Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly.When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics-potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin)-dosage adjustments of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resin-absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH-intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (eg, norepinephrine)-possible decreased response to pressor amines,but not sufficient to preclude their therapeutic use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (eg, tubocurarine)-possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase - 2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) - In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs."

        "Drug Interactions Concomitant diuretic therapy: As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with quinapril hydrochloride. The possibility of hypotensive effects with quinapril hydrochloride may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with quinapril hydrochloride. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Agents increasing serum potassium: Coadministration of quinapril with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Tetracycline and other drugs that interact with magnesium: Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril hydrochloride reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril hydrochloride and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Other agents: Drug interaction studies of quinapril with other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril. The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice-daily. Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of atorvastatin with 80 mg of quinapril resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with quinapril in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with quinapril in patients with renal impairment (GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m2)."

When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics—potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin)—dosage adjustments of the antidiabetic drug may be required (See PRECAUTIONS ). Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resin—absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH—intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., norepinephrine)—possible decreased response to pressor amines, but not sufficient to preclude their therapeutic use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine)—possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.

Hydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, but there has not been enough systematic collection of data to support an estimate of the frequency of the observed adverse reactions. Within organ-system groups, the reported reactions are listed here in decreasing order of severity, without regard to frequency. BODY AS A WHOLE: Weakness. CARDIOVASCULAR: Orthostatic hypotension (may be potentiated by alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics). DIGESTIVE: Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic), sialadenitis, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, nausea, gastric irritation, constipation, and anorexia. NEUROLOGIC: Vertigo, lightheadedness, transient blurred vision, headache, paresthesia, xanthopsia, weakness, and restlessness. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Muscle spasm. HEMATOLOGIC: Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. RENAL: Renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis (see WARNINGS ). METABOLIC: Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and hyperuricemia. HYPERSENSITIVITY: Necrotizing angiitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema), purpura, urticaria, rash, and photosensitivity. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes: See PRECAUTIONS . Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen Increases (>1.25 times the upper limit of normal) in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were observed in 3% and 4%, respectively, of patients treated with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide. Most increases were minor and reversible, which can occur in patients with essential hypertension but most frequently in patients with renal artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS ). PBI and Tests of Parathyroid Function: See PRECAUTIONS . Hematology: See WARNINGS . Other (causal relationships unknown) Other clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide administration. Elevations in uric acid, glucose, magnesium, cholesterol, triglyceride, and calcium (see PRECAUTIONS ) have been reported."

        "Drug Interactions As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with quinapril hydrochloride. The possibility of hypotensive effects with quinapril hydrochloride may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with quinapril hydrochloride. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see ). Concomitant diuretic therapy: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Coadministration of quinapril with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Agents increasing serum potassium: Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril hydrochloride reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril hydrochloride and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Tetracycline and other drugs that interact with magnesium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Lithium: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Gold: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Drug interaction studies of quinapril with other agents showed: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): Agents that inhibit mTOR: Other agents: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril. The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice-daily. Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of atorvastatin with 80 mg of quinapril resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin. Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with quinapril in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with quinapril in patients with renal impairment (GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m ). Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): 2"

If it is not possibleto discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see DOSAGE ANDADMINISTRATION). Agents increasing serum potassium Quinapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazidediuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. If concomitant therapy of quinaprilhydrochloride with potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride),potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes is indicated, they should be usedwith caution along with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). Tetracycline and other drugs that interact with magnesium Simultaneous administration oftetracycline with quinapril hydrochloride reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril hydrochloride tablets. Thisinteraction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril hydrochloride and tetracycline or otherdrugs that interact with magnesium. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported inpatients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should becoadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If adiuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Other agents Drug interaction studies of quinapril hydrochloride with other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics ofsingle doses of quinapril hydrochloride. The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was notsignificantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice-daily. quinapril hydrochloride treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril hydrochloride andhydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of atorvastatin with 80 mg of quinapril hydrochlorideresulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin."

        "Drug Interactions Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Coadministration of quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min/ 1.73 m2). Tetracycline and Other Drugs That Interact with Magnesium: Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Other Agents: Drug interaction studies of quinapril and other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril. The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice daily. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. Digoxin: Thiazide-induced electrolyte disturbances, i.e. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, increase the risk of digoxin toxicity, which may lead to fatal arrhythmic events (See PRECAUTIONS). When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics—potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin)—dosage adjustments of the antidiabetic drug may be required (See PRECAUTIONS). Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resin—absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH—intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., norepinephrine)—possible decreased response to pressor amines, but not sufficient to preclude their therapeutic use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine)—possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs—the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents."

        "Drug Interactions Concomitant Diuretic Therapy As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with quinapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with quinapril may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with quinapril. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Quinapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. If concomitant therapy of quinapril with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes is indicated, they should be used with caution along with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see ). PRECAUTIONS Tetracycline and Other Drugs That Interact With Magnesium Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril tablets reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Other Agents Drug interaction studies of quinapril with other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril. The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice-daily. Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. Coadministration of multiple 10 mg doses of atorvastatin with 80 mg of quinapril resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin."

        "Drug Interactions Concomitant Diuretic Therapy As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with quinapril hydrochloride. The possibility of hypotensive effects with quinapril hydrochloride may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with quinapril hydrochloride. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Coadministration of quinapril hydrochloride with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Tetracycline and Other Drugs That Interact With Magnesium Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril hydrochloride reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets.

Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Other Agents Drug interaction studies of quinapril hydrochloride with other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril hydrochloride.

Coadministration of multiple 10 mg doses of atorvastatin with 80 mg of quinapril hydrochloride resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril hydrochloride and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with quinapril hydrochloride in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with quinapril hydrochloride in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)."

Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Hematology (See WARNINGS) Hyperkalemia (See PRECAUTIONS) Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen Increases (>1.25 times the upper limit of normal) in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were observed in 2% and 2%, respectively, of all patients treated with quinapril hydrochloride tablets alone. Increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretic therapy than in those on quinapril hydrochloride tablets alone. These increases often remit on continued therapy. In controlled studies of heart failure, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 11% and 8%, respectively, of patients treated with quinapril hydrochloride tablets; most often these patients were receiving diuretics with or without digitalis."

        "Drug Interactions: Concomitant diuretic therapy: As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with quinapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with quinapril may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with quinapril. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Agents increasing serum potassium: Quinapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. If concomitant therapy of quinapril with potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes is indicated, they should be used with caution along with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). Tetracycline and other drugs that interact with magnesium: Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Other agents: Drug interaction studies of quinapril with other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril. The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice-daily. Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of atorvastatin with 80 mg of quinapril resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin."

        "Drug Interactions Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Co-administration of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Tetracycline and Other Drugs That Interact with Magnesium Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium.

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Othe r Agents Drug interaction studies of quinapril and other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril. The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril co-administration twice daily. Digoxin: Thiazide-induced electrolyte disturbances, i.e. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, increase the risk of digoxin toxicity, which may lead to fatal arrhythmic events (see PRECAUTIONS ). No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics—potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin)—dosage adjustments of the antidiabetic drug may be required (see PRECAUTIONS ). Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resin—absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH—intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., norepinephrine)—possible decreased response to pressor amines, but not sufficient to preclude their therapeutic use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine)—possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs—the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents."

Hydrochlorothiazide has been extensively prescribed for many years, but there has not been enough systematic collection of data to support an estimate of the frequency of the observed adverse reactions. Within organ-system groups, the reported reactions are listed here in decreasing order of severity, without regard to frequency. BODY AS A WHOLE: Weakness. CARDIOVASCULAR: Orthostatic hypotension (may be potentiated by alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics). DIGESTIVE: Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic), sialadenitis, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, nausea, gastric irritation, constipation, and anorexia. NEUROLOGIC: Vertigo, lightheadedness, transient blurred vision, headache, paresthesia, xanthopsia, weakness, and restlessness. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Muscle spasm. HEMATOLOGIC: Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. RENAL: Renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis (see WARNINGS). METABOLIC: Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and hyperuricemia. HYPERSENSITIVITY: Necrotizing angiitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema), purpura, urticaria, rash, and photosensitivity. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes: See PRECAUTIONS. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Increases (> 1.25 times the upper limit of normal) in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were observed in 3% and 4%, respectively, of patients treated with quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide. Most increases were minor and reversible, which can occur in patients with essential hypertension but most frequently in patients with renal artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS). PBI and Tests of Parathyroid Function: See PRECAUTIONS. Hematology: See WARNINGS. Other (causal relationships unknown): Other clinically important changes in standard laboratory tests were rarely associated with quinapril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide administration. Elevations in uric acid, glucose, magnesium, cholesterol, triglyceride, and calcium (see PRECAUTIONS) have been reported."

        "Drug Interactions Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics As noted above ("Derangements of Serum Electrolytes"), the net effect of quinapril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with quinapril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Quinapril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Tetracycline and Other Drugs That Interact with Magnesium Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Other Agents Drug interaction studies of quinapril and other agents showed: Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril. The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice daily. Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics—potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic Drugs (oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin)—dosage adjustments of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resin—absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH—intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor Amines (e.g., norepinephrine)—possible decreased response to pressor amines, but not sufficient to preclude their therapeutic use. Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine)—possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)—in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co­administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with quinapril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with quinapril hydrochloride/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min)."

        "Drug Interactions Concomitant diuretic therapy: As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with quinapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with quinapril may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with quinapril. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Agents increasing serum potassium: Quinapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. If concomitant therapy of quinapril with potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes is indicated, they should be used with caution along with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). Tetracycline and other drugs that interact with magnesium: Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including quinapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Other agents: Drug interaction studies of quinapril with other agents showed: -Multiple dose therapy with propranolol or cimetidine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of quinapril. -The anticoagulant effect of a single dose of warfarin (measured by prothrombin time) was not significantly changed by quinapril coadministration twice-daily. -Quinapril treatment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. -No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when single doses of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide were administered concomitantly. -Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of atorvastatin with 80 mg of quinapril resulted in no significant change in the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on quinapril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with quinapril in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with quinapril in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension Quinapril has been evaluated for safety in 4960 subjects and patients. Of these, 3203 patients, including 655 elderly patients, participated in controlled clinical trials. Quinapril has been evaluated for long-term safety in over 1400 patients treated for 1 year or more. Adverse experiences were usually mild and transient. In placebo-controlled trials, discontinuation of therapy because of adverse events was required in 4.7% of patients with hypertension. Adverse experiences probably or possibly related to therapy or of unknown relationship to therapy occurring in 1% or more of the 1563 patients in placebo-controlled hypertension trials who were treated with quinapril are shown below.

Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and/or larynx occurs, treatment with quinapril should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. (See WARNINGS.) Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Hematology: (See WARNINGS.) Hyperkalemia: (See PRECAUTIONS) Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen: Increases (> 1.25 times the upper limit of normal) in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were observed in 2% and 2%, respectively, of all patients treated with quinapril alone. Increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretic therapy than in those on quinapril alone. These increases often remit on continued therapy."

        "Drug Interactions Concomitant diuretic therapy: As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with quinapril hydrochloride. The possibility of hypotensive effects with quinapril hydrochloride may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with quinapril hydrochloride. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of quinapril should be reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Agents increasing serum potassium: Quinapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. If concomitant therapy of quinapril hydrochloride with potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes is indicated, they should be used with caution along with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). Tetracycline and other drugs that interact with magnesium: Simultaneous administration of tetracycline with quinapril hydrochloride reduced the absorption of tetracycline by approximately 28% to 37%, possibly due to the high magnesium content in quinapril tablets. This interaction should be considered if coprescribing quinapril hydrochloride and tetracycline or other drugs that interact with magnesium. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy.
