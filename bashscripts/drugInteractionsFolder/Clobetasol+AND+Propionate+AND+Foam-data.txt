In larger controlled trials with other clobetasol propionate formulations, the most frequently reported local adverse reactions have included burning, stinging, irritation, pruritus, erythema, folliculitis, cracking and fissuring of the skin, numbness of the fingers, skin atrophy, and telangiectasia (all less than 2%). The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids, but they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids such as clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05%. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: dryness, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, striae, and miliaria."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam has been shown to suppress the HPA axis. Systemic absorption of Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam may produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmask latent diabetes. (5.1) -Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. (5.1) -Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. (5.1) -High potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, and liver failure may predispose patients to HPA axis suppression. (5.1) -Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) -The propellant in Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam is flammable. Avoid fire, flame, or smoking during and immediately following application. (5.4) 5.1 Effects on Endocrine System Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Systemic absorption of Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion has caused reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. Use of Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam for longer than 2 weeks may suppress the immune system. [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In a trial including 37 subjects aged 12 and older with at least 30% body surface area (BSA), adrenal suppression was identified in 6 out of 37 subjects (16.2%) after 2 weeks of treatment with Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than 1 corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses because of their larger skin surface- to-body mass ratios. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. If irritation develops, treatment with Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists, Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.4 Flammable Contents The propellant in Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam is flammable. Avoid fire, flame, or smoking during and immediately following application. Do not puncture and/or incinerate the containers. Do not expose containers to heat and/or store at temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."

An adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than 1 corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses because of their larger skin surface- to-body mass ratios. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. If irritation develops, treatment with Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists, Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.4 Flammable Contents The propellant in Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam is flammable. Avoid fire, flame, or smoking during and immediately following application. Do not puncture and/or incinerate the containers. Do not expose containers to heat and/or store at temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In a controlled pharmacokinetic study, 5 of 13 subjects experienced reversible suppression of the adrenals at any time during the 14 days of Olux Foam therapy to at least 20% of the body surface area. Of the 13 subjects studied, 1 of 9 with psoriasis were suppressed after 14 days and all 4 of the subjects with atopic dermatitis had abnormal cortisol levels indicative of adrenal suppression at some time after starting therapy with Olux Foam. (See Table 3 below.) Table 3: Subjects with reversible HPA axis suppression at any time during treatment Dermatosis Olux Foam Psoriasis 1 of 9 Atopic Dermatitis 4 of 4 Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible adrenal suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients (see PRECAUTIONS). In a controlled clinical trial (188 subjects) with Olux Foam in subjects with psoriasis of the scalp, there were no localized scalp adverse reactions reported in the Olux Foam treated subjects. In two controlled clinical trials (360 subjects) with Olux Foam in subjects with psoriasis of non-scalp regions, localized adverse events that occurred in the Olux Foam treated subjects included application site burning (10%), application site dryness (< 1%), and other application site reactions (4%). In larger controlled trials with other clobetasol propionate formulations, the most frequently reported local adverse reactions have included burning, stinging, irritation, pruritus, erythema, folliculitis, cracking and fissuring of the skin, numbness of the fingers, skin atrophy, and telangiectasia (all less than 2%). The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids, but they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids such as Olux Foam. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: dryness, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, striae, and miliaria."
