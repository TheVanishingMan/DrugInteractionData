        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions, which may include fatalities, are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: •Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] •Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] •Constipation and Bowel Obstruction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] •Extravasation Tissue Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] •Neurologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] •Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) are neutropenia, anemia, liver enzyme elevation, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, constipation, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying designs and in different patient populations, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. Single Agent The data below reflect exposure to Vinorelbine as a single agent administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on a weekly basis to 365 patients enrolled in 3 controlled studies for metastatic NSCLC and advanced breast cancer. The population included 143 previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients (Study 3) who received a median of 8 doses of Vinorelbine. The patients were aged 32 to 79 (median 61 years), 71% were male, 91% Caucasian, 48% had adenocarcinoma histology. The data also reflect exposure to Vinorelbine in 222 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer who received a median of 10 doses of Vinorelbine. Vinorelbine is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer. Selected adverse reactions reported in these studies are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) of single agent Vinorelbine were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, increased total bilirubin, AST elevation, injection site reaction and asthenia. Approximately 49% of NSCLC patients treated with Vinorelbine experienced at least one dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Thirteen percent of patients discontinued Vinorelbine due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to Vinorelbine discontinuation were asthenia, dyspnea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, myasthenia and fever.

Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity. Neurotoxicity: neurotoxicity was most commonly manifested as constipation, paresthesia, hypersthesia, and hyporeflexia. Grade 3 and 4 neuropathy was observed in 1% of the patients receiving single-agent Vinorelbine. Injection site reactions: Injection site reactions, including erythema, pain at injection site, and vein discoloration, occurred in approximately one third of patients; 5% were severe. Phlebitis (chemical phlebitis) along the vein proximal to the site of injection was reported in 10% of patients. Cardiovascular toxicity: Chest pain occurred in 5% of patients; myocardial infarction occurred in less than 0.1% of patients. Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Dyspnea (shortness of breath) was reported in 3% of patients; it was severe in 2%. Interstitial pulmonary changes were documented. Other: Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in <1% of patients. In Combination with Cisplatin Table 3 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 10% of Vinorelbine treated patients reported in a randomized trial comparing the combination of Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 administered every week of each 28-day cycle and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of each 28-day cycle versus cisplatin alone at the same dose and schedule in patients with previously untreated NSCLC (Study 1). Patients randomized to Vinorelbine plus cisplatin received a median of 3 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin alone received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. Thirty-Five percent of the eligible patients in the combination arm required treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction compared to 19% in the cisplatin alone arm. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the Vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm (82%) compared to the cisplatin alone arm (5%). Four patients in the Vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm died of neutropenic sepsis. Seven additional deaths were reported in the combination arm: 2 from cardiac ischemia, 1 cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of Vinorelbine, and 3 from febrile neutropenia.

A total of 604 patients received either Vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 every week plus cisplatin 120 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 29, then every 6 weeks thereafter (N=207), vindesine 3 mg/m2 for 6 weeks, then every other week thereafter plus cisplatin 120 mg/m2 on Days 1 and Day 29, then every 6 weeks thereafter (N=193) or Vinorelbine 30mg/m2 every week (N=204). Patients randomized to Vinorelbine plus cisplatin received a median of 15 weeks of treatment, vindesine plus cisplatin 12 weeks and Vinorelbine received 13 weeks. Study discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was required in 27, 22 and 10% of the patients randomized to Vinorelbine plus cisplatin, vindesine plus cisplatin and cisplatin alone arms, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly greater in the Vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm (78%) compared to vindesine plus cisplatin (48%) and Vinorelbine alone (53%). Neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathy and constipation was reported in 44% (Grades 3-4, 7%) of the patients receiving Vinorelbine plus cisplatin, 58% (Grades 3-4, 17%) of the patients receiving vindesine and cisplatin and 44% (Grades 3-4, 8.5%) of the patients receiving Vinorelbine alone.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hepatic toxicity: monitor liver function during treatment (5.2) •Severe constipation and bowel obstruction including necrosis and perforation can occur. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation. Monitor for abdominal pain and severe constipation (5.3) •Extravasation can result in severe tissue injury, necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. Immediately stop Vinorelbine and institute recommended management procedures (5.4) •Neurologic toxicity: severe sensory and motor neuropathies can occur. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy (5.5) •Pulmonary toxicity and respiratory failure can occur with use of Vinorelbine. Monitor patients respiratory disorders: dyspnea and bronchospasm Interrupt Vinorelbine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea (5.6) •Embryo-fetal toxicity: can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.7, 8.1). 5.1 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia occur with Vinorelbine as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with Vinorelbine. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 53% of patients treated with Vinorelbine at 30 mg/m2 per week. Dose adjustment due to myelosuppression occurred in 51% of patients (Study 2). In clinical trials with Vinorelbine administered at 30 mg/m2 per week, neutropenia resulted in hospitalizations for pyrexia and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients. Neutropenia nadirs occur between 7 and 10 days after dosing with neutropenia count recovery usually occurring within the following 7 to 14 days. Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of Vinorelbine. Do not administer Vinorelbine to patients with neutrophil counts <1,000 cells/mm3. Adjustments in the dosage of Vinorelbine should be based on neutrophil counts obtained on the day of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury manifest by elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin can occur in patients receiving Vinorelbine alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Vinorelbine and periodically during treatment. Reduce the dose of Vinorelbine for patients who develop elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times upper limit of normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 5.3 Severe Constipation and Bowel Obstruction Severe and fatal paralytic ileus, constipation, intestinal obstruction, necrosis, and perforation occur with Vinorelbine administration. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners. 5.4 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation of Vinorelbine can result in severe irritation, local tissue necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of Vinorelbine and institute recommended management procedures [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reaction (6.1) ]. 5.5 Neurologic Toxicity Sensory and motor neuropathies, including severe neuropathies, occur in patients receiving Vinorelbine. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, hyporeflexia and muscle weakness while receiving Vinorelbine. Discontinue Vinorelbine for NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reaction (6.1) ]. 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including severe acute bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs with use of Vinorelbine. Interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS included fatalities. The mean time to onset of interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS after vinorelbine administration was one week (range 3 to 8 days) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Interrupt Vinorelbine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity. Permanently discontinue Vinorelbine for confirmed interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Vinorelbine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy with Vinorelbine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.7)]."

Single Agent The data below reflect exposure to Vinorelbine as a single agent administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on a weekly basis to 365 patients enrolled in 3 controlled studies for metastatic NSCLC and advanced breast cancer. The population included 143 previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients (Study 3) who received a median of 8 doses of Vinorelbine. The patients were aged 32 to 79 (median 61 years), 71% were male, 91% Caucasian, 48% had adenocarcinoma histology. The data also reflect exposure to Vinorelbine in 222 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer who received a median of 10 doses of Vinorelbine. Vinorelbine is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer. Selected adverse reactions reported in these studies are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) of single agent Vinorelbine were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, increased total bilirubin, AST elevation, injection site reaction and asthenia. Approximately 49% of NSCLC patients treated with Vinorelbine experienced at least one dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Thirteen percent of patients discontinued Vinorelbine due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to Vinorelbine discontinuation were asthenia, dyspnea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, myasthenia and fever.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatic toxicity: monitor liver function during treatment (5.2) Severe constipation and bowel obstruction including necrosis and perforation can occur. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation. Monitor for abdominal pain and severe constipation (5.3) Extravasation can result in severe tissue injury, necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. Immediately stop Vinorelbine and institute recommended management procedures (5.4) Neurologic toxicity: severe sensory and motor neuropathies can occur. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy (5.5) Pulmonary toxicity and respiratory failure can occur with use of Vinorelbine. Monitor patients respiratory disorders: dyspnea and bronchospasm Interrupt Vinorelbine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea (5.6) Embryo-fetal toxicity: can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.7, 8.1) 5.1 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia occur with Vinorelbine as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with Vinorelbine. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 53% of patients treated with Vinorelbine at 30 mg/m2 per week. Dose adjustment due to myelosuppression occurred in 51% of patients (Study 2). In clinical trials with Vinorelbine administered at 30 mg/m2 per week, neutropenia resulted in hospitalizations for pyrexia and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients. Neutropenia nadirs occur between 7 and 10 days after dosing with neutropenia count recovery usually occurring within the following 7 to 14 days. Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of Vinorelbine. Do not administer Vinorelbine to patients with neutrophil counts <1,000 cells/mm3. Adjustments in the dosage of Vinorelbine should be based on neutrophil counts obtained on the day of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury manifest by elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin can occur in patients receiving Vinorelbine alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Vinorelbine and periodically during treatment. Reduce the dose of Vinorelbine for patients who develop elevations in total bilirubin ≥ 2 times upper limit of normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.3 Severe Constipation and Bowel Obstruction Severe and fatal paralytic ileus, constipation, intestinal obstruction, necrosis, and perforation occur with Vinorelbine administration. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners. 5.4 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation of Vinorelbine can result in severe irritation, local tissue necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of Vinorelbine and institute recommended management procedures [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Neurologic Toxicity Sensory and motor neuropathies, including severe neuropathies, occur in patients receiving Vinorelbine. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, hyporeflexia and muscle weakness while receiving Vinorelbine. Discontinue Vinorelbine for NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including severe acute bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs with use of Vinorelbine. Interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS included fatalities. The mean time to onset of interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS after vinorelbine administration was one week (range 3 to 8 days) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Interrupt Vinorelbine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity. Permanently discontinue Vinorelbine for confirmed interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Vinorelbine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy with Vinorelbine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.7)]."

        "Drug Interactions Acute pulmonary reactions have been reported with vinorelbine and other anticancer vinca alkaloids used in conjunction with mitomycin. Although the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine are not influenced by the concurrent administration of cisplatin, the incidence of granulocytopenia with vinorelbine used in combination with cisplatin is significantly higher than with single-agent vinorelbine. Patients who receive vinorelbine and paclitaxel, either concomitantly or sequentially, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of neuropathy. Administration of vinorelbine to patients with prior or concomitant radiation therapy may result in radiosensitizing effects. Caution should be exercised in patients concurrently taking drugs known to inhibit drug metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily, or in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of vinorelbine tartrate with an inhibitor of this metabolic pathway may cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of side effects."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse reactions is similar whether vinorelbine is used as a single agent or in combination. Adverse reactions from studies with single-agent and combination use of vinorelbine are summarized in Tables 2-4. Single-Agent Vinorelbine Data in the following table are based on the experience of 365 patients (143 patients with NSCLC; 222 patients with advanced breast cancer) treated with IV vinorelbine as a single agent in 3 clinical studies. The dosing schedule in each study was 30 mg/m2 vinorelbine on a weekly basis. Table 2: Summary of Adverse Events in 365 Patients Receiving Single-Agent VINORELBINENone of the reported toxicities were influenced by age. Grade based on modified criteria from the National Cancer Institute. Patients with NSCLC had not received prior chemotherapy. The majority of the remaining patients had received prior chemotherapy.: Adverse Event All Patients (n=365) NSCLC (n=143) Bone Marrow Granulocytopenia <2,000 cells/mm3 90% 80% <500 cells/mm3 36% 29% Leukopenia <4,000 cells/mm3 92% 81% <1,000 cells/mm3 15% 12% Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 5% 4% <50,000 cells/mm3 1% 1% Anemia <11 g/dL 83% 77% <8 g/dL 9% 1% Hospitalizations due to granulocytopenic complications 9% 8% Adverse Event All Grades Grade 3 Grade 4 All Patients NSCLC All Patients NSCLC All Patients NSCLC Clinical Chemistry Elevations Total Bilirubin (n=351) 13% 9% 4% 3% 3% 2% SGOT (n=346) 67% 54% 5% 2% 1% 1% General Asthenia 36% 27% 7% 5% 0% 0% Injection Site Reactions 28% 38% 2% 5% 0% 0% Injection Site Pain 16% 13% 2% 1% 0% 0% Phlebitis 7% 10% <1% 1% 0% 0% Digestive Nausea 44% 34% 2% 1% 0% 0% Vomiting 20% 15% 2% 1% 0% 0% Constipation 35% 29% 3% 2% 0% 0% Diarrhea 17% 13% 1% 1% 0% 0% Peripheral Neuropathy Incidence of paresthesia plus hypesthesia 25% 20% 1% 1% <1% 0% Dyspnea 7% 3% 2% 2% 1% 0% Alopecia 12% 12% ≤1% 1% 0% 0% Hematologic Granulocytopenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with vinorelbine. Dose adjustments are required for hematologic toxicity and hepatic insufficiency (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Granulocytopenia was generally reversible and not cumulative over time. Granulocyte nadirs occurred 7 to 10 days after the dose, with granulocyte recovery usually within the following 7 to 14 days. Granulocytopenia resulted in hospitalizations for fever and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Septic deaths occurred in approximately 1% of patients. Prophylactic hematologic growth factors have not been routinely used with vinorelbine. If medically necessary, growth factors may be administered at recommended doses no earlier than 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Growth factors should not be administered in the period 24 hours before the administration of chemotherapy. Whole blood and/or packed red blood cells were administered to 18% of patients who received vinorelbine. Neurologic Loss of deep tendon reflexes occurred in less than 5% of patients. The development of severe peripheral neuropathy was infrequent (1%) and generally reversible. Skin Like other anticancer vinca alkaloids, vinorelbine is a moderate vesicant. Injection site reactions, including erythema, pain at injection site, and vein discoloration, occurred in approximately one third of patients; 5% were severe. Chemical phlebitis along the vein proximal to the site of injection was reported in 10% of patients. Gastrointestinal Prophylactic administration of antiemetics was not routine in patients treated with single-agent vinorelbine. Due to the low incidence of severe nausea and vomiting with single-agent vinorelbine, the use of serotonin antagonists is generally not required. Hepatic Transient elevations of liver enzymes were reported without clinical symptoms. Cardiovascular Chest pain was reported in 5% of patients. Most reports of chest pain were in patients who had either a history of cardiovascular disease or tumor within the chest. There have been rare reports of myocardial infarction. Pulmonary Shortness of breath was reported in 3% of patients; it was severe in 2% (see WARNINGS ). Interstitial pulmonary changes were documented. Other Fatigue occurred in 27% of patients. It was usually mild or moderate but tended to increase with cumulative dosing. Other toxicities that have been reported in less than 5% of patients include jaw pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in <1% of patients. Combination Use Adverse events for combination use are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Vinorelbine in Combination with Cisplatin Vinorelbine plus Cisplatin versus Single-Agent Cisplatin (Table 3) Myelosuppression was the predominant toxicity in patients receiving combination therapy, Grade 3 and 4 granulocytopenia of 82% compared to 5% in the single-agent cisplatin arm. Fever and/or sepsis related to granulocytopenia occurred in 11% of patients on vinorelbine and cisplatin compared to 0% on the cisplatin arm. Four patients on the combination died of granulocytopenia-related sepsis. During this study, the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ([G-CSF] filgrastim) was permitted, but not mandated, after the first course of treatment for patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia (≤1,000 cells/mm3) or in those who developed neutropenic fever between cycles of chemotherapy. Beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy, G-CSF was started at a dose of 5 mcg/kg per day and continued until the total granulocyte count was >1,000 cells/mm3 on 2 successive determinations. G-CSF was not administered on the day of treatment. Grade 3 and 4 anemia occurred more frequently in the combination arm compared to control, 24% vs. 8%, respectively. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 6% of patients treated with vinorelbine plus cisplatin compared to 2% of patients treated with cisplatin. The incidence of severe non-hematologic toxicity was similar among the patients in both treatment groups. Patients receiving vinorelbine plus cisplatin compared to single-agent cisplatin experienced more Grade 3 and/or 4 peripheral numbness (2% vs. <1%), phlebitis/thrombosis/embolism (3% vs. <1%), and infection (6% vs. <1%). Grade 3-4 constipation and/or ileus occurred in 3% of patients treated with combination therapy and in 1% of patients treated with cisplatin. Seven deaths were reported on the combination arm; 2 were related to cardiac ischemia, 1 massive cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of vinorelbine, and 3 from febrile neutropenia. One death, secondary to respiratory infection unrelated to granulocytopenia, occurred with single-agent cisplatin. Vinorelbine plus Cisplatin versus Vindesine plus Cisplatin versus Single-Agent Vinorelbine (Table 4) Myelosuppression, specifically Grade 3 and 4 granulocytopenia, was significantly greater with the combination of vinorelbine plus cisplatin (79%) than with either single-agent vinorelbine (53%) or vindesine plus cisplatin (48%), P<0.0001. Hospitalization due to documented sepsis occurred in 4.4% of patients treated with vinorelbine plus cisplatin; 2% of patients treated with vindesine and cisplatin, and 4% of patients treated with single-agent vinorelbine. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was infrequent in patients receiving combination chemotherapy and no events were reported with single-agent vinorelbine. The incidence of Grade 3 and/or 4 nausea and vomiting, alopecia, and renal toxicity were reported more frequently in the cisplatin-containing combinations compared to single-agent vinorelbine. Severe local reactions occurred in 2% of patients treated with combinations containing vinorelbine; none were observed in the vindesine plus cisplatin arm. Grade 3 and 4 neurotoxicity was significantly more frequent in patients receiving vindesine plus cisplatin (17%) compared to vinorelbine plus cisplatin (7%) and single-agent vinorelbine (9%) (P < 0.005). Cisplatin did not appear to increase the incidence of neurotoxicity observed with single-agent vinorelbine.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to vinorelbine. Body as a Whole Systemic allergic reactions reported as anaphylaxis, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema; flushing; and radiation recall events such as dermatitis and esophagitis (see PRECAUTIONS ) have been reported. Hematologic Thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolus and deep venous thrombosis, have been reported primarily in seriously ill and debilitated patients with known predisposing risk factors for these events. Neurologic Peripheral neurotoxicities such as, but not limited to, muscle weakness and disturbance of gait, have been observed in patients with and without prior symptoms. There may be increased potential for neurotoxicity in patients with pre-existing neuropathy, regardless of etiology, who receive vinorelbine. Vestibular and auditory deficits have been observed with vinorelbine, usually when used in combination with cisplatin. Skin Injection site reactions, including localized rash and urticaria, blister formation, and skin sloughing have been observed in clinical practice. Some of these reactions may be delayed in appearance. Gastrointestinal Dysphagia, mucositis, and pancreatitis have been reported. Cardiovascular Hypertension, hypotension, vasodilation, tachycardia, and pulmonary edema have been reported. Pulmonary Pneumonia has been reported. Musculoskeletal Headache has been reported, with and without other musculoskeletal aches and pains. Other Pain in tumor-containing tissue, back pain, and abdominal pain have been reported. Electrolyte abnormalities, including hyponatremia with or without the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, have been reported in seriously ill and debilitated patients. Combination Use Patients with prior exposure to paclitaxel and who have demonstrated neuropathy should be monitored closely for new or worsening neuropathy. Patients who have experienced neuropathy with previous drug regimens should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy while receiving vinorelbine. Vinorelbine may result in radiosensitizing effects with prior or concomitant radiation therapy (see PRECAUTIONS )."

ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) are neutropenia, anemia, liver enzyme elevation, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, constipation, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www. fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions, which may include fatalities, are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Constipation and Bowel Obstruction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Extravasation Tissue Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Neurologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying designs and in different patient populations, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. Single Agent The data below reflect exposure to Vinorelbine Injection as a single agent administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on a weekly basis to 365 patients enrolled in 3 controlled studies for metastatic NSCLC and advanced breast cancer. The population included 143 previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients (Study 3) who received a median of 8 doses of Vinorelbine Injection. The patients were aged 32 to 79 (median 61 years), 71% were male, 91% Caucasian, 48% had adenocarcinoma histology. The data also reflect exposure to Vinorelbine Injection in 222 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer who received a median of 10 doses of Vinorelbine Injection. Vinorelbine Injection is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer. Selected adverse reactions reported in these studies are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) of single agent Vinorelbine Injection were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, increased total bilirubin, AST elevation, injection site reaction and asthenia. Approximately 49% of NSCLC patients treated with Vinorelbine Injection experienced at least one dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Thirteen percent of patients discontinued Vinorelbine Injection due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to Vinorelbine Injection discontinuation were asthenia, dyspnea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, myasthenia and fever.

Other: Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in <1% of patients. In Combination with Cisplatin Table 3 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 10% of Vinorelbine Injection treated patients reported in a randomized trial comparing the combination of Vinorelbine Injection 25 mg/m2 administered every week of each 28-day cycle and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of each 28-day cycle versus cisplatin alone at the same dose and schedule in patients with previously untreated NSCLC (Study 1). Patients randomized to Vinorelbine Injection plus cisplatin received a median of 3 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin alone received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. Thirty-Five percent of the eligible patients in the combination arm required treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction compared to 19% in the cisplatin alone arm. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the Vinorelbine Injection plus cisplatin arm (82%) compared to the cisplatin alone arm (5%). Four patients in the Vinorelbine Injection plus cisplatin arm died of neutropenic sepsis. Seven additional deaths were reported in the combination arm: 2 from cardiac ischemia, 1 cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of Vinorelbine Injection, and 3 from febrile neutropenia.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatic toxicity: monitor liver function during treatment (5.2) Severe constipation and bowel obstruction including necrosis and perforation can occur. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation. Monitor for abdominal pain and severe constipation (5.3) Extravasation can result in severe tissue injury, necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. Immediately stop Vinorelbine Injection and institute recommended management procedures (5.4) Neurologic toxicity: severe sensory and motor neuropathies can occur. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy 5.5) Pulmonary toxicity and respiratory failure can occur with use of Vinorelbine Injection. Monitor patients respiratory disorders: dyspnea and bronchospasm Interrupt Vinorelbine Injection, in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea (5.6) Embryo-fetal toxicity: can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.7, 8.1). 5.1 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia occur with Vinorelbine Injection as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with Vinorelbine Injection. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 53% of patients treated with Vinorelbine Injection, at 30 mg/m2 per week. Dose adjustment due to myelosuppression occurred in 51% of patients (Study 2). In clinical trials with Vinorelbine Injection administered at 30 mg/m2 per week, neutropenia resulted in hospitalizations for pyrexia and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients. Neutropenia nadirs occur between 7 and 10 days after dosing with neutropenia count recovery usually occurring within the following 7 to 14 days. Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of Vinorelbine Injection. Do not administer Vinorelbine Injection to patients with neutrophil counts <1,000 cells/mm3. Adjustments in the dosage of Vinorelbine Injection, should be based on neutrophil counts obtained on the day of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury manifest by elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin can occur in patients receiving Vinorelbine Injection, alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Vinorelbine Injection, and periodically during treatment. Reduce the dose of Vinorelbine Injection, for patients who develop elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times upper limit of normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.3 Severe Constipation and Bowel Obstruction Severe and fatal paralytic ileus, constipation, intestinal obstruction, necrosis, and perforation occur with Vinorelbine Injection, administration. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners. 5.4 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation of Vinorelbine Injection, can result in severe irritation, local tissue necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of Vinorelbine Injection, and institute recommended management procedures. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.5 Neurologic Toxicity Sensory and motor neuropathies, including severe neuropathies, occur in patients receiving Vinorelbine Injection. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, hyporeflexia and muscle weakness while receiving Vinorelbine Injection. Discontinue Vinorelbine Injection for NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including severe acute bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs with use of Vinorelbine Injection. Interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS included fatalities. The mean time to onset of interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS after vinorelbine administration was one week (range 3 to 8 days) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Interrupt Vinorelbine Injection in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity. Permanently discontinue Vinorelbine Injection for confirmed interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Vinorelbine Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy with Vinorelbine Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.7)]."

Single Agent The data below reflect exposure to NAVELBINE as a single agent administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on a weekly basis to 365 patients enrolled in 3 controlled studies for metastatic NSCLC and advanced breast cancer. The population included 143 previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients (Study 3) who received a median of 8 doses of NAVELBINE. The patients were aged 32 to 79 (median 61 years), 71% were male, 91% Caucasian, 48% had adenocarcinoma histology. The data also reflect exposure to NAVELBINE in 222 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer who received a median of 10 doses of NAVELBINE. NAVELBINE is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer. Selected adverse reactions reported in these studies are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) of single agent NAVELBINE were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, increased total bilirubin, AST elevation, injection site reaction and asthenia. Approximately 49% of NSCLC patients treated with Navelbine experienced at least one dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Thirteen percent of patients discontinued NAVELBINE due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to NAVELBINE discontinuation were asthenia, dyspnea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, myasthenia and fever.

Myelosuppression: In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 69%, 9% and 1%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent NAVELBINE. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity. Neurotoxicity: neurotoxicity was most commonly manifested as constipation, paresthesia, hypersthesia, and hyporeflexia. Grade 3 and 4 neuropathy was observed in 1% of the patients receiving single-agent NAVELBINE. Injection site reactions: Injection site reactions, including erythema, pain at injection site, and vein discoloration, occurred in approximately one third of patients; 5% were severe. Phlebitis (chemical phlebitis) along the vein proximal to the site of injection was reported in 10% of patients. Cardiovascular toxicity: Chest pain occurred in 5% of patients; myocardial infarction occurred in less than 0.1% of patients. Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Dyspnea (shortness of breath) was reported in 3% of patients; it was severe in 2%. Interstitial pulmonary changes were documented. Other: Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in <1% of patients. In Combination with Cisplatin Table 3 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 10% of NAVELBINE treated patients reported in a randomized trial comparing the combination of NAVELBINE 25 mg/m2 administered every week of each 28-day cycle and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of each 28-day cycle versus cisplatin alone at the same dose and schedule in patients with previously untreated NSCLC (Study 1). Patients randomized to NAVELBINE plus cisplatin received a median of 3 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin alone received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. Thirty-Five percent of the eligible patients in the combination arm required treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction compared to 19% in the cisplatin alone arm. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the NAVELBINE plus cisplatin arm (82%) compared to the cisplatin alone arm (5%). Four patients in the NAVELBINE plus cisplatin arm died of neutropenic sepsis. Seven additional deaths were reported in the combination arm: 2 from cardiac ischemia, 1 cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of NAVELBINE, and 3 from febrile neutropenia.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatic toxicity: monitor liver function during treatment (5.2) Severe constipation and bowel obstruction including necrosis and perforation can occur. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation. Monitor for abdominal pain and severe constipation (5.3) Extravasation can result in severe tissue injury, necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. Immediately stop NAVELBINE and institute recommended management procedures (5.4) Neurologic toxicity: severe sensory and motor neuropathies can occur. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy (5.5) Pulmonary toxicity and respiratory failure can occur with use of NAVELBINE. Monitor patients respiratory disorders: dyspnea and bronchospasm Interrupt NAVELBINE in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea (5.6) Embryo-fetal toxicity: can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.7, 8.1) 5.1 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia occur with NAVELBINE® as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2) ]. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with NAVELBINE. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 53% of patients treated with NAVELBINE at 30 mg/m2 per week. Dose adjustment due to myelosuppression occurred in 51% of patients (Study 2). In clinical trials with NAVELBINE administered at 30 mg/m2 per week, neutropenia resulted in hospitalizations for pyrexia and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients. Neutropenia nadirs occur between 7 and 10 days after dosing with neutropenia count recovery usually occurring within the following 7 to 14 days. Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of NAVELBINE. Do not administer NAVELBINE to patients with neutrophil counts <1,000 cells/mm3. Adjustments in the dosage of NAVELBINE should be based on neutrophil counts obtained on the day of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury manifest by elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin can occur in patients receiving NAVELBINE alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of NAVELBINE and periodically during treatment. Reduce the dose of NAVELBINE for patients who develop elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times upper limit of normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 5.3 Severe Constipation and Bowel Obstruction Severe and fatal paralytic ileus, constipation, intestinal obstruction, necrosis, and perforation occur with NAVELBINE administration. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners. 5.4 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation of NAVELBINE can result in severe irritation, local tissue necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of NAVELBINE and institute recommended management procedures [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reaction (6.1) ]. 5.5 Neurologic Toxicity Sensory and motor neuropathies, including severe neuropathies, occur in patients receiving NAVELBINE. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, hyporeflexia and muscle weakness while receiving NAVELBINE. Discontinue NAVELBINE for NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reaction (6.1) ]. 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including severe acute bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs with use of NAVELBINE. Interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS included fatalities. The mean time to onset of interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS after vinorelbine administration was one week (range 3 to 8 days) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Interrupt NAVELBINE in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity. Permanently discontinue NAVELBINE for confirmed interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity NAVELBINE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy with NAVELBINE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.7) ]."

        "Drug Interactions: Acute pulmonary reactions have been reported with Vinorelbine Injection USP and other anticancer vinca alkaloids used in conjunction with mitomycin. Although the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine are not influenced by the concurrent administration of cisplatin, the incidence of granulocytopenia with Vinorelbine Injection USP used in combination with cisplatin is significantly higher than with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. Patients who receive Vinorelbine Injection USP and paclitaxel, either concomitantly or sequentially should be monitored for signs and symptoms of neuropathy. Administration of Vinorelbine Injection USP to patients with prior or concomitant radiation therapy may result in radio sensitizing effects. Caution should be exercised in patients concurrently taking drugs known to inhibit drug metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily, or in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of vinorelbine tartrate with an inhibitor of this metabolic pathway may cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of side effects."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse reactions is similar whether Vinorelbine Injection USP is used as a single agent or in combination. Adverse reactions from studies with single-agent and combination use of Vinorelbine Injection USP are summarized in Tables 2-4. Single-Agent Vinorelbine Injection USP: Data in the following table are based on the experience of 365 patients (143 patients with NSCLC; 222 patients with advanced breast cancer) treated with IV Vinorelbine Injection USP as a single agent in 3 clinical studies. The dosing schedule in each study was 30 mg/m2 Vinorelbine Injection USP on a weekly basis. Table 2: Summary of Adverse Events in 365 Patients Receiving Single-Agent Vinorelbine Injection USP *†: Adverse Event All Patients ( n = 365 ) NSCLC ( n = 143 ) Bone Marrow Granulocytopenia <2,000 cells/mm3 90% 80% <500 cells/mm3 36% 29% Leukopenia <4,000 cells/mm3 92% 81% <1,000 cells/mm3 15% 12% Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 5% 4% <50,000 cells/mm3 1% 1% Anemia <11 g/dL 83% 77% <8 g/dL 9% 1% Hospitalizations due to granulocytopenic complications 9% 8% All Grades Grade 3 Grade 4 Adverse Event All Patients NSCLC All Patients NSCLC All Patients NSCLC Clinical Chemistry Elevations Total Bilirubin (n = 351) SGOT (n = 346) General Asthenia Injection Site Reactions Injection Site Pain Phlebitis Digestive Nausea Vomiting Constipation Diarrhea Peripheral Neuropathy‡ Dyspnea Alopecia 13% 67% 36% 28% 16% 7% 44% 20% 35% 17% 25% 7% 12% 9% 54% 27% 38% 13% 10% 34% 15% 29% 13% 20% 3% 12% 4% 5% 7% 2% 2% <1% 2% 2% 3% 1% 1% 2% ≤1% 3% 2% 5% 5% 1% 1% 1% 1% 2% 1% 1% 2% 1% 3% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% <1% 1% 0% 2% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% * None of the reported toxicities were influenced by age. Grade based on modified criteria from the National Cancer Institute. † Patents with NSCLC had not received prior chemotherapy. The majority of the remaining patents had received prior chemotherapy. ‡ Incidence of paresthesia plus hypesthesia. Hematologic: Granulocytopenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with Vinorelbine Injection USP. Dose adjustments are required for hematologic toxicity and hepatic insufficiency (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Granulocytopenia was generally reversible and not cumulative over time. Granulocyte nadirs occurred 7 to 10 days after the dose, with granulocyte recovery usually within the following 7 to 14 days. Granulocytopenia resulted in hospitalizations for fever and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Septic deaths occurred in approximately 1% of patients. Prophylactic hematologic growth factors have not been routinely used with Vinorelbine Injection USP. If medically necessary, growth factors maybe administered at recommended doses no earlier than 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Growth factors should not be administered in the period 24 hours before the administration of chemotherapy. Whole blood and/or packed red blood calls were administered to 18% of patients who received Vinorelbine Injection USP. Neurologic: Loss of deep tendon reflexes occurred in less than 5% of patients. The development of severe peripheral neuropathy was infrequent (1%) and generally reversible. Skin: Like other anticancer vinca alkaloids, Vinorelbine Injection USP is a moderate vesicant. Injection site reactions, including erythema, pain at injection site, and vein discoloration, occurred in approximately one third of patients; 5% were severe. Chemical phlebitis along the vein proximal to the site of injection was reported in 10% of patents. Gastrointestinal: Prophylactic administration of antiemetics was not routine in patients treated with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. Due to the low incidence of severe nausea and vomiting with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP, the use of serotonin antagonists is generally not required. Hepatic: Transient elevations of liner enzymes were reported without clinical symptoms. Cardiovascular: Chest pain was reported in 5% of patients. Most reports of chest pain were in patients who had either a history of cardiovascular disease or tumor within the chest. There have been rare reports of myocardial infarction. Pulmonary: Shortness of breath was reported in 3% of patients; it was severe in 2% (see WARNINGS). Interstitial pulmonary changes were documented. Other: Fatigue occurred in 27% of patients. It was usually mild or moderate but tended to increase with cumulative dosing. Other toxicities that have been reported in less than 5% of patients include jaw pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in <1% of patients. Combination Use: Adverse events for combination use are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Vinorelbine Injection USP in Combination with Cisplatin: Vinorelbine Injection USP plus Cisplatin versus Single-Agent Cisplatin (Table 3): Myelosuppression was the predominant toxicity in patients receiving combination therapy, Grade 3 and 4 granulocytopenia of 82% compared to 5% in the single-agent cisplatin arm. Fever and/or sepsis related to granulocytopenia occurred in 11% of patients on Vinorelbine Injection USP and cisplatin compared to 0% on the cisplatin arm. Four patients on the combination died of granulocytopenia-related sepsis. During this study, the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [(G-CSF) filgrastim) was permitted, but not mandated, after the first course of treatment for patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia (xl,000 cells/mm3) or in those who developed neutropenic fever between cycles of chemotherapy. Beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy, G-CSF was started at a dose of 5 mcg/kg per day and continued until the total granulocyte count was >1000 cells/mm3 on 2 successive determinations. G-CSF was not administered on the day of treatment. Grade 3 and 4 anemia occurred more frequently in the combination arm compared to control, 24% vs. 8%, respectively. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 6% of patients treated with Vinorelbine Injection USP plus cisplatin compared to 2% of patients treated with cisplatin. The incidence of severe non-hematologic toxicity was similar among the patients in both treatment groups. Patients receiving Vinorelbine Injection USP plus cisplatin compared to single-agent cisplatin experienced more Grade 3 and/or 4 peripheral numbness (2% vs. <1%), phlebitis/thrombosis/embolism (3% vs. <1%), and infection (6% vs. <1%). Grade 3-4 constipation and/or ileus occurred in 3% of patients treated with combination therapy and in 1% of patients treated with cisplatin. Seven deaths were reported on the combination arm; 2 were related to cardiac ischemia, 1 massive cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of Vinorelbine Injection USP, and 3 from febrile neutropenia. One death, secondary to respiratory infection unrelated to granulocytopenia, occurred with single-agent cisplatin. Vinorelbine Injection USP plus Cisplatin versus Vindesine plus Cisplatin versus Single-Agent Vinorelbine (Table 4): Myelosuppression, specifically Grade 3 and 4 granulocytopenia, was significantly greater with the combination of Vinorelbine Injection USP plus cisplatin (79%) than with either single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP (53%) or vindesine plus cisplatin (48%), P<0.0001. Hospitalization due to documented sepsis occurred in 4.4% of patients treated with Vinorelbine Injection USP plus cisplatin: 2% of patients treated with vindesine and cisplatin, and 4% of patients treated with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was infrequent in patients receiving combination chemotherapy and no events were reported with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. The incidence of Grade 3 and/or 4 nausea and vomiting, alopecia, and renal toxicity were reported more frequently in the cisplatin-containing combinations compared to single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. Severe local reactions occurred in 2% of patients treated with combinations containing Vinorelbine Injection USP; none were observed in the vindesine plus cisplatin arm. Grade 3 and 4 neurotoxicity was significantly more frequent in patents receiving vindesine plus cisplatin (17%) compared to Vinorelbine Injection USP plus cisplatin (7%) and single-agent vinorelbine (9%) (P<0.005). Cisplatin did not appear to increase the incidence of neurotoxicity observed with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP.

Observed During Clinical Practice: in addition to the adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of Vinorelbine Injection USP. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to Vinorelbine Injection USP. Body as a Whole: Systemic allergic reactions reported as anaphylaxis, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema; flushing; and radiation recall events such as dermatitis and esophagitis (see PRECAUTIONS) have been reported. Hematologic: Thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolus and deep venous thrombosis, have been reported primarily in seriously ill and debilitated patients with known predisposing risk factors for these events. Neurologic: Peripheral neurotoxicities such as, but not limited to, muscle weakness and disturbance of gait; have been observed in patients with and without prior symptoms. There may be increased potential for neurotoxicity in patients with pre-existing neuropathy, regardless of etiology, who receive Vinorelbine Injection USP. Vestibular and auditory deficits have been observed with Vinorelbine Injection USP, usually when used in combination with cisplatin. Skin: Injection site reactions, including localized rash and urticaria, blister formation, and skin sloughing have been observed in clinical practice. Some of these reactions may be delayed in appearance. Gastrointestinal: Dysphagia, mucositis, and pancreatitis have been reported. Cardiovascular: Hypertension, hypotension, vasodilation, tachycardia, and pulmonary edema have been reported. Pulmonary: Pneumonia has been reported. Musculoskeletal: Headache has been reported, with and without other musculosketetal aches and pains. Other: Pain in tumor-containing tissue, back pain, and abdominal pain have been reported. Electrolyte abnormalities, including hyponatremia with or without the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, have been reported in seriously ill and debilitated patients. Combination Use: Patients with prior exposure to paclitaxel and who have demonstrated neuropathy should he monitored closely for new or worsening neuropathy. Patients who have experienced neuropathy with previous drug regimens should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy while receiving Vinorelbine Injection USP . Vinorelbine Injection USP may result in radiosensitizing effects with prior or concomitant radiation therapy (see PRECAUTIONS)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) are neutropenia, anemia, liver enzyme elevation, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, constipation, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions, which may include fatalities, are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: • Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] • Constipation and Bowel Obstruction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] • Extravasation Tissue Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Neurologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] • Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying designs and in different patient populations, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. Single Agent The data below reflect exposure to Vinorelbine Injection as a single agent administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on a weekly basis to 365 patients enrolled in 3 controlled studies for metastatic NSCLC and advanced breast cancer. The population included 143 previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients (Study 3) who received a median of 8 doses of Vinorelbine Injection. The patients were aged 32 to 79 (median 61 years), 71% were male, 91% Caucasian, 48% had adenocarcinoma histology. The data also reflect exposure to Vinorelbine Injection in 222 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer who received a median of 10 doses of Vinorelbine Injection. Vinorelbine Injection is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer. Selected adverse reactions reported in these studies are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) of single agent Vinorelbine Injection were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, increased total bilirubin, AST elevation, injection site reaction and asthenia. Approximately 49% of NSCLC patients treated with Vinorelbine Injection experienced at least one dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Thirteen percent of patients discontinued Vinorelbine Injection due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to Vinorelbine Injection discontinuation were asthenia, dyspnea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, myasthenia and fever.

Myelosuppression: In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 69%, 9% and 1%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent Vinorelbine Injection. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity. Neurotoxicity: Neurotoxicity was most commonly manifested as constipation, paresthesia, hypersthesia, and hyporeflexia. Grade 3 and 4 neuropathy was observed in 1% of the patients receiving single-agent Vinorelbine Injection. Injection sitereactions: Injection site reactions, including erythema, pain at injection site, and vein discoloration, occurred in approximately one third of patients; 5% were severe. Phlebitis (chemical phlebitis) along the vein proximal to the site of injection was reported in 10% of patients. Cardiovascular toxicity:Chest pain occurred in 5% of patients; myocardial infarction occurred in less than 0.1% of patients. Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure:Dyspnea (shortness of breath) was reported in 3% of patients; it was severe in 2%. Interstitial pulmonary changes were documented. Other:Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in <1% of patients. In Combination with Cisplatin Table 3 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 10% of Vinorelbine Injection treated patients reported in a randomized trial comparing the combination of Vinorelbine Injection 25 mg/m2 administered every week of each 28-day cycle and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of each 28-day cycle versus cisplatin alone at the same dose and schedule in patients with previously untreated NSCLC (Study 1). Patients randomized to Vinorelbine Injection plus cisplatin received a median of 3 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin alone received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. Thirty-Five percent of the eligible patients in the combination arm required treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction compared to 19% in the cisplatin alone arm. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the Vinorelbine Injection plus cisplatin arm (82%) compared to the cisplatin alone arm (5%). Four patients in the Vinorelbine Injection plus cisplatin arm died of neutropenic sepsis. Seven additional deaths were reported in the combination arm: 2 from cardiac ischemia, 1 cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of Vinorelbine Injection, and 3 from febrile neutropenia.

A total of 604 patients received either Vinorelbine Injection 30 mg/m2 every week plus cisplatin 120 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 29, then every 6 weeks thereafter (N=207), vindesine 3 mg/m2 for 6 weeks, then every other week thereafter plus cisplatin 120 mg/m2 on Days 1 and Day 29, then every 6 weeks thereafter (N=193) or Vinorelbine Injection 30 mg/m2 every week (N=204). Patients randomized to Vinorelbine Injection plus cisplatin received a median of 15 weeks of treatment, vindesine plus cisplatin 12 weeks and Vinorelbine Injection received 13 weeks. Study discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was required in 27, 22 and 10% of the patients randomized to Vinorelbine Injection plus cisplatin, vindesine plus cisplatin and cisplatin alone arms, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly greater in the Vinorelbine Injection plus cisplatin arm (78%) compared to vindesine plus cisplatin (48%) and Vinorelbine Injection alone (53%). Neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathy and constipation was reported in 44% (Grades 3‑4, 7%) of the patients receiving Vinorelbine Injection plus cisplatin, 58% (Grades 3-4, 17%) of the patients receiving vindesine and cisplatin and 44% (Grades 3-4, 8.5%) of the patients receiving Vinorelbine Injection alone.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hepatic toxicity: monitor liver function during treatment (5.2) •Severe constipation and bowel obstruction including necrosis and perforation can occur. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation. Monitor for abdominal pain and severe constipation (5.3) •Extravasation can result in severe tissue injury, necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. Immediately stop Vinorelbine Injection and institute recommended management procedures (5.4) •Neurologic toxicity: severe sensory and motor neuropathies can occur. •Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy (5.5) •Pulmonary toxicity and respiratory failure can occur with use of Vinorelbine Injection. Monitor patients respiratory disorders: dyspnea and bronchospasm Interrupt Vinorelbine Injection, in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea (5.6) •Embryo-fetal toxicity: can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.7, 8.1). 5.1 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia occur with Vinorelbine Injection as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with Vinorelbine Injection. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 53% of patients treated with Vinorelbine Injection, at 30 mg/m2 per week. Dose adjustment due to myelosuppression occurred in 51% of patients (Study 2). In clinical trials with Vinorelbine Injection administered at 30 mg/m2 per week, neutropenia resulted in hospitalizations for pyrexia and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients. Neutropenia nadirs occur between 7 and 10 days after dosing with neutropenia count recovery usually occurring within the following 7 to 14 days. Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of Vinorelbine Injection. Do not administer Vinorelbine Injection to patients with neutrophil counts <1,000 cells/mm3. Adjustments in the dosage of Vinorelbine Injection, should be based on neutrophil counts obtained on the day of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury manifest by elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin can occur in patients receiving Vinorelbine Injection, alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of Vinorelbine Injection, and periodically during treatment. Reduce the dose of Vinorelbine Injection, for patients who develop elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times upper limit of normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.3 Severe Constipation and Bowel Obstruction Severe and fatal paralytic ileus, constipation, intestinal obstruction, necrosis, and perforation occur with Vinorelbine Injection, administration. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners. 5.4 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation of Vinorelbine Injection, can result in severe irritation, local tissue necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of Vinorelbine Injection, and institute recommended management procedures. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.5 Neurologic Toxicity Sensory and motor neuropathies, including severe neuropathies, occur in patients receiving Vinorelbine Injection. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, hyporeflexia and muscle weakness while receiving Vinorelbine Injection. Discontinue Vinorelbine Injection for NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including severe acute bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs with use of Vinorelbine Injection. Interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS included fatalities. The mean time to onset of interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS after vinorelbine administration was one week (range 3 to 8 days) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Interrupt Vinorelbine Injection in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity. Permanently discontinue Vinorelbine Injection for confirmed interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Vinorelbine Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy with Vinorelbine Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.7)]."

        "Drug Interactions Acute pulmonary reactions have been reported with vinorelbine and other anticancer vinca alkaloids used in conjunction with mitomycin. Although the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine are not influenced by the concurrent administration of cisplatin, the incidence of granulocytopenia with vinorelbine used in combination with cisplatin is significantly higher than with single-agent vinorelbine. Patients who receive vinorelbine and paclitaxel, either concomitantly or sequentially, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of neuropathy. Administration of vinorelbine to patients with prior or concomitant radiation therapy may result in radiosensitizing effects. Caution should be exercised in patients concurrently taking drugs known to inhibit drug metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily, or in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of vinorelbine tartrate with an inhibitor of this metabolic pathway may cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of side effects."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse reactions is similar whether vinorelbine is used as a single agent or in combination. Adverse reactions from studies with single-agent and combination use of vinorelbine are summarized in Tables 2-4. Single-Agent Vinorelbine Data in the following table are based on the experience of 365 patients (143 patients with NSCLC; 222 patients with advanced breast cancer) treated with IV vinorelbine as a single agent in 3 clinical studies. The dosing schedule in each study was 30 mg/m2 vinorelbine on a weekly basis. Table 2: Summary of Adverse Events in 365 Patients Receiving Single-Agent VINORELBINENone of the reported toxicities were influenced by age. Grade based on modified criteria from the National Cancer Institute. Patients with NSCLC had not received prior chemotherapy. The majority of the remaining patients had received prior chemotherapy.: Adverse Event All Patients (n=365) NSCLC (n=143) Bone Marrow Granulocytopenia <2,000 cells/mm3 90% 80% <500 cells/mm3 36% 29% Leukopenia <4,000 cells/mm3 92% 81% <1,000 cells/mm3 15% 12% Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm3 5% 4% <50,000 cells/mm3 1% 1% Anemia <11 g/dL 83% 77% <8 g/dL 9% 1% Hospitalizations due to granulocytopenic complications 9% 8% Adverse Event All Grades Grade 3 Grade 4 All Patients NSCLC All Patients NSCLC All Patients NSCLC Clinical Chemistry Elevations Total Bilirubin (n=351) 13% 9% 4% 3% 3% 2% SGOT (n=346) 67% 54% 5% 2% 1% 1% General Asthenia 36% 27% 7% 5% 0% 0% Injection Site Reactions 28% 38% 2% 5% 0% 0% Injection Site Pain 16% 13% 2% 1% 0% 0% Phlebitis 7% 10% <1% 1% 0% 0% Digestive Nausea 44% 34% 2% 1% 0% 0% Vomiting 20% 15% 2% 1% 0% 0% Constipation 35% 29% 3% 2% 0% 0% Diarrhea 17% 13% 1% 1% 0% 0% Peripheral Neuropathy Incidence of paresthesia plus hypesthesia 25% 20% 1% 1% <1% 0% Dyspnea 7% 3% 2% 2% 1% 0% Alopecia 12% 12% ≤1% 1% 0% 0% Hematologic Granulocytopenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with vinorelbine. Dose adjustments are required for hematologic toxicity and hepatic insufficiency (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Granulocytopenia was generally reversible and not cumulative over time. Granulocyte nadirs occurred 7 to 10 days after the dose, with granulocyte recovery usually within the following 7 to 14 days. Granulocytopenia resulted in hospitalizations for fever and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Septic deaths occurred in approximately 1% of patients. Prophylactic hematologic growth factors have not been routinely used with vinorelbine. If medically necessary, growth factors may be administered at recommended doses no earlier than 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Growth factors should not be administered in the period 24 hours before the administration of chemotherapy. Whole blood and/or packed red blood cells were administered to 18% of patients who received vinorelbine. Neurologic Loss of deep tendon reflexes occurred in less than 5% of patients. The development of severe peripheral neuropathy was infrequent (1%) and generally reversible. Skin Like other anticancer vinca alkaloids, vinorelbine is a moderate vesicant. Injection site reactions, including erythema, pain at injection site, and vein discoloration, occurred in approximately one third of patients; 5% were severe. Chemical phlebitis along the vein proximal to the site of injection was reported in 10% of patients. Gastrointestinal Prophylactic administration of antiemetics was not routine in patients treated with single-agent vinorelbine. Due to the low incidence of severe nausea and vomiting with single-agent vinorelbine, the use of serotonin antagonists is generally not required. Hepatic Transient elevations of liver enzymes were reported without clinical symptoms. Cardiovascular Chest pain was reported in 5% of patients. Most reports of chest pain were in patients who had either a history of cardiovascular disease or tumor within the chest. There have been rare reports of myocardial infarction. Pulmonary Shortness of breath was reported in 3% of patients; it was severe in 2% (see WARNINGS ). Interstitial pulmonary changes were documented. Other Fatigue occurred in 27% of patients. It was usually mild or moderate but tended to increase with cumulative dosing. Other toxicities that have been reported in less than 5% of patients include jaw pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in <1% of patients. Combination Use Adverse events for combination use are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Vinorelbine in Combination with Cisplatin Vinorelbine plus Cisplatin versus Single-Agent Cisplatin (Table 3) Myelosuppression was the predominant toxicity in patients receiving combination therapy, Grade 3 and 4 granulocytopenia of 82% compared to 5% in the single-agent cisplatin arm. Fever and/or sepsis related to granulocytopenia occurred in 11% of patients on vinorelbine and cisplatin compared to 0% on the cisplatin arm. Four patients on the combination died of granulocytopenia-related sepsis. During this study, the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ([G-CSF] filgrastim) was permitted, but not mandated, after the first course of treatment for patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia (≤1,000 cells/mm3) or in those who developed neutropenic fever between cycles of chemotherapy. Beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy, G-CSF was started at a dose of 5 mcg/kg per day and continued until the total granulocyte count was >1,000 cells/mm3 on 2 successive determinations. G-CSF was not administered on the day of treatment. Grade 3 and 4 anemia occurred more frequently in the combination arm compared to control, 24% vs. 8%, respectively. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 6% of patients treated with vinorelbine plus cisplatin compared to 2% of patients treated with cisplatin. The incidence of severe non-hematologic toxicity was similar among the patients in both treatment groups. Patients receiving vinorelbine plus cisplatin compared to single-agent cisplatin experienced more Grade 3 and/or 4 peripheral numbness (2% vs. <1%), phlebitis/thrombosis/embolism (3% vs. <1%), and infection (6% vs. <1%). Grade 3-4 constipation and/or ileus occurred in 3% of patients treated with combination therapy and in 1% of patients treated with cisplatin. Seven deaths were reported on the combination arm; 2 were related to cardiac ischemia, 1 massive cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of vinorelbine, and 3 from febrile neutropenia. One death, secondary to respiratory infection unrelated to granulocytopenia, occurred with single-agent cisplatin. Vinorelbine plus Cisplatin versus Vindesine plus Cisplatin versus Single-Agent Vinorelbine (Table 4) Myelosuppression, specifically Grade 3 and 4 granulocytopenia, was significantly greater with the combination of vinorelbine plus cisplatin (79%) than with either single-agent vinorelbine (53%) or vindesine plus cisplatin (48%), P<0.0001. Hospitalization due to documented sepsis occurred in 4.4% of patients treated with vinorelbine plus cisplatin; 2% of patients treated with vindesine and cisplatin, and 4% of patients treated with single-agent vinorelbine. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was infrequent in patients receiving combination chemotherapy and no events were reported with single-agent vinorelbine. The incidence of Grade 3 and/or 4 nausea and vomiting, alopecia, and renal toxicity were reported more frequently in the cisplatin-containing combinations compared to single-agent vinorelbine. Severe local reactions occurred in 2% of patients treated with combinations containing vinorelbine; none were observed in the vindesine plus cisplatin arm. Grade 3 and 4 neurotoxicity was significantly more frequent in patients receiving vindesine plus cisplatin (17%) compared to vinorelbine plus cisplatin (7%) and single-agent vinorelbine (9%) (P < 0.005). Cisplatin did not appear to increase the incidence of neurotoxicity observed with single-agent vinorelbine.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to vinorelbine. Body as a Whole Systemic allergic reactions reported as anaphylaxis, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema; flushing; and radiation recall events such as dermatitis and esophagitis (see PRECAUTIONS ) have been reported. Hematologic Thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolus and deep venous thrombosis, have been reported primarily in seriously ill and debilitated patients with known predisposing risk factors for these events. Neurologic Peripheral neurotoxicities such as, but not limited to, muscle weakness and disturbance of gait, have been observed in patients with and without prior symptoms. There may be increased potential for neurotoxicity in patients with pre-existing neuropathy, regardless of etiology, who receive vinorelbine. Vestibular and auditory deficits have been observed with vinorelbine, usually when used in combination with cisplatin. Skin Injection site reactions, including localized rash and urticaria, blister formation, and skin sloughing have been observed in clinical practice. Some of these reactions may be delayed in appearance. Gastrointestinal Dysphagia, mucositis, and pancreatitis have been reported. Cardiovascular Hypertension, hypotension, vasodilation, tachycardia, and pulmonary edema have been reported. Pulmonary Pneumonia has been reported. Musculoskeletal Headache has been reported, with and without other musculoskeletal aches and pains. Other Pain in tumor-containing tissue, back pain, and abdominal pain have been reported. Electrolyte abnormalities, including hyponatremia with or without the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, have been reported in seriously ill and debilitated patients. Combination Use Patients with prior exposure to paclitaxel and who have demonstrated neuropathy should be monitored closely for new or worsening neuropathy. Patients who have experienced neuropathy with previous drug regimens should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy while receiving vinorelbine. Vinorelbine may result in radiosensitizing effects with prior or concomitant radiation therapy (see PRECAUTIONS )."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions, which may include fatalities, are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Constipation and Bowel Obstruction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Extravasation Tissue Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Neurologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 20%) are neutropenia, anemia, liver enzyme elevation, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, constipation, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying designs and in different patient populations, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. Single Agent The data below reflect exposure to vinorelbine as a single agent administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on a weekly basis to 365 patients enrolled in 3 controlled studies for metastatic NSCLC and advanced breast cancer. The population included 143 previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients (Study 3) who received a median of 8 doses of vinorelbine. The patients were aged 32 to 79 (median 61 years), 71% were male, 91% Caucasian, 48% had adenocarcinoma histology. The data also reflect exposure to vinorelbine in 222 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer who received a median of 10 doses of vinorelbine. Vinorelbine is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer. Selected adverse reactions reported in these studies are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20%) of single agent vinorelbine were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common (greater than or equal to 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, increased total bilirubin, AST elevation, injection site reaction and asthenia. Approximately 49% of NSCLC patients treated with vinorelbine experienced at least one dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Thirteen percent of patients discontinued vinorelbine due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to vinorelbine discontinuation were asthenia, dyspnea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, myasthenia and fever.

Phlebitis (chemical phlebitis) along the vein proximal to the site of injection was reported in 10% of patients. Cardiovascular toxicity: Chest pain occurred in 5% of patients; myocardial infarction occurred in less than 0.1% of patients. Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Dyspnea (shortness of breath) was reported in 3% of patients; it was severe in 2%. Interstitial pulmonary changes were documented. Other: Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in less than 1% of patients. In Combination with Cisplatin Table 3 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of vinorelbine treated patients reported in a randomized trial comparing the combination of vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 administered every week of each 28-day cycle and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of each 28-day cycle versus cisplatin alone at the same dose and schedule in patients with previously untreated NSCLC (Study 1).

Thirty-Five percent of the eligible patients in the combination arm required treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction compared to 19% in the cisplatin alone arm. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm (82%) compared to the cisplatin alone arm (5%). Four patients in the vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm died of neutropenic sepsis. Seven additional deaths were reported in the combination arm: 2 from cardiac ischemia, 1 cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of vinorelbine, and 3 from febrile neutropenia. Table 4 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of vinorelbine treated patients reported in a randomized trial of vinorelbine plus cisplatin, vindesine plus cisplatin and vinorelbine alone in patients with stage III or IV NSCLC who had not received prior chemotherapy. A total of 604 patients received either vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 every week plus cisplatin 120 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 29, then every 6 weeks thereafter (N=207), vindesine 3 mg/m2 for 6 weeks, then every other week thereafter plus cisplatin 120 mg/m2 on Days 1 and Day 29, then every 6 weeks thereafter (N=193) or vinorelbine 30mg/m2 every week (N=204). Patients randomized to vinorelbine plus cisplatin received a median of 15 weeks of treatment, vindesine plus cisplatin 12 weeks and vinorelbine received 13 weeks. Study discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was required in 27, 22 and 10% of the patients randomized to vinorelbine plus cisplatin, vindesine plus cisplatin and cisplatin alone arms, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly greater in the vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm (78%) compared to vindesine plus cisplatin (48%) and vinorelbine alone (53%). Neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathy and constipation was reported in 44% (Grades 3-4, 7%) of the patients receiving vinorelbine plus cisplatin, 58% (Grades 3-4, 17%) of the patients receiving vindesine and cisplatin and 44% (Grades 3-4, 8.5%) of the patients receiving vinorelbine alone.

Infections and infestations: pneumonia Immune system disorders: anaphylactic reaction, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema Nervous system disorders: loss of deep tendon reflexes, muscular weakness, gait disturbance, headache Ear and labyrinth disorders: vestibular disorder, hearing impaired Cardiac disorders: tachycardia Respiratory disorders: pulmonary edema Vascular disorders: pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, hypertension, hypotension, flushing, vasodilatation Gastrointestinal disorders: mucosal inflammation, dysphagia, pancreatitis Skin disorders: generalized cutaneous reactions (rash) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: jaw pain, myalgia, arthralgia General disorders and administration site conditions: injection site rash, urticaria, blistering, sloughing of skin Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: radiation recall phenomenon, dermatitis, esophagitis Laboratory abnormalities: electrolyte imbalance including hyponatremia Other: tumor pain, back pain, abdominal pain"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatic toxicity: monitor liver function during treatment (5.2) Severe constipation and bowel obstruction including necrosis and perforation can occur. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation. Monitor for abdominal pain and severe constipation (5.3) Extravasation can result in severe tissue injury, necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. Immediately stop vinorelbine and institute recommended management procedures (5.4) Neurologic toxicity: severe sensory and motor neuropathies can occur. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy (5.5) Pulmonary toxicity and respiratory failure can occur with use of vinorelbine. Monitor patients respiratory disorders: dyspnea and bronchospasm Interrupt vinorelbine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea (5.6) Embryo-fetal toxicity: can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.7, 8.1). 5.1 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia occur with vinorelbine as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with vinorelbine. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 53% of patients treated with vinorelbine at 30 mg/m2 per week. Dose adjustment due to myelosuppression occurred in 51% of patients (Study 2). In clinical trials with vinorelbine administered at 30 mg/m2 per week, neutropenia resulted in hospitalizations for pyrexia and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients. Neutropenia nadirs occur between 7 and 10 days after dosing with neutropenia count recovery usually occurring within the following 7 to 14 days. Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of vinorelbine. Do not administer vinorelbine to patients with neutrophil counts less than 1,000 cells/mm3. Adjustments in the dosage of vinorelbine should be based on neutrophil counts obtained on the day of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury manifest by elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin can occur in patients receiving vinorelbine alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of vinorelbine and periodically during treatment. Reduce the dose of vinorelbine for patients who develop elevations in total bilirubin greater than 2 times upper limit of normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.3 Severe Constipation and Bowel Obstruction Severe and fatal paralytic ileus, constipation, intestinal obstruction, necrosis, and perforation occur with vinorelbine administration. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners. 5.4 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation of vinorelbine can result in severe irritation, local tissue necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of vinorelbine and institute recommended management procedures. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reaction (6.1)] 5.5 Neurologic Toxicity Sensory and motor neuropathies, including severe neuropathies, occur in patients receiving vinorelbine. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, hyporeflexia and muscle weakness while receiving vinorelbine. Discontinue vinorelbine for NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reaction (6.1)] 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including severe acute bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs with use of vinorelbine. Interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS included fatalities. The mean time to onset of interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS after vinorelbine administration was one week (range 3 to 8 days) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Interrupt vinorelbine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity. Permanently discontinue vinorelbine for confirmed interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Vinorelbine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy with vinorelbine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.7)]."

        "Drug Interactions: Acute pulmonary reactions have been reported with Vinorelbine Injection USP and other anticancer vinca alkaloids used in conjunction with mitomycin. Although the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine are not influenced by the concurrent administration of cisplatin, the incidence of granulocytopenia with Vinorelbine Injection USP used in combination with cisplatin is significantly higher than with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. Patients who receive Vinorelbine Injection USP and paclitaxel, either concomitantly or sequentially should be monitored for signs and symptoms of neuropathy. Administration of Vinorelbine Injection USP to patients with prior or concomitant radiation therapy may result in radio sensitizing effects. Caution should be exercised in patients concurrently taking drugs known to inhibit drug metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily, or in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of vinorelbine tartrate with an inhibitor of this metabolic pathway may cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of side effects."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The pattern of adverse reactions is similar whether Vinorelbine Injection USP is used as a single agent or in combination. Adverse reactions from studies with single-agent and combination use of Vinorelbine Injection USP are summarized in Tables 2-4. Single-Agent Vinorelbine Injection USP: Data in the following table are based on the experience of 365 patients (143 patients with NSCLC; 222 patients with advanced breast cancer) treated with IV Vinorelbine Injection USP as a single agent in 3 clinical studies. The dosing schedule in each study was 30 mg/m2 Vinorelbine Injection USP on a weekly basis.

Grade based on modified criteria from the National Cancer Institute. † Patents with NSCLC had not received prior chemotherapy. The majority of the remaining patents had received prior chemotherapy. ‡ Incidence of paresthesia plus hypesthesia. Hematologic: Granulocytopenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with Vinorelbine Injection USP. Dose adjustments are required for hematologic toxicity and hepatic insufficiency (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Granulocytopenia was generally reversible and not cumulative over time. Granulocyte nadirs occurred 7 to 10 days after the dose, with granulocyte recovery usually within the following 7 to 14 days. Granulocytopenia resulted in hospitalizations for fever and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Septic deaths occurred in approximately 1% of patients. Prophylactic hematologic growth factors have not been routinely used with Vinorelbine Injection USP. If medically necessary, growth factors maybe administered at recommended doses no earlier than 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Growth factors should not be administered in the period 24 hours before the administration of chemotherapy. Whole blood and/or packed red blood calls were administered to 18% of patients who received Vinorelbine Injection USP. Neurologic: Loss of deep tendon reflexes occurred in less than 5% of patients. The development of severe peripheral neuropathy was infrequent (1%) and generally reversible. Skin: Like other anticancer vinca alkaloids, Vinorelbine Injection USP is a moderate vesicant. Injection site reactions, including erythema, pain at injection site, and vein discoloration, occurred in approximately one third of patients; 5% were severe. Chemical phlebitis along the vein proximal to the site of injection was reported in 10% of patents. Gastrointestinal: Prophylactic administration of antiemetics was not routine in patients treated with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. Due to the low incidence of severe nausea and vomiting with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP, the use of serotonin antagonists is generally not required. Hepatic: Transient elevations of liner enzymes were reported without clinical symptoms. Cardiovascular: Chest pain was reported in 5% of patients. Most reports of chest pain were in patients who had either a history of cardiovascular disease or tumor within the chest. There have been rare reports of myocardial infarction. Pulmonary: Shortness of breath was reported in 3% of patients; it was severe in 2% (see WARNINGS). Interstitial pulmonary changes were documented. Other: Fatigue occurred in 27% of patients. It was usually mild or moderate but tended to increase with cumulative dosing. Other toxicities that have been reported in less than 5% of patients include jaw pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in <1% of patients. Combination Use: Adverse events for combination use are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Vinorelbine Injection USP in Combination with Cisplatin: Vinorelbine Injection USP plus Cisplatin versus Single-Agent Cisplatin (Table 3): Myelosuppression was the predominant toxicity in patients receiving combination therapy, Grade 3 and 4 granulocytopenia of 82% compared to 5% in the single-agent cisplatin arm. Fever and/or sepsis related to granulocytopenia occurred in 11% of patients on Vinorelbine Injection USP and cisplatin compared to 0% on the cisplatin arm. Four patients on the combination died of granulocytopenia-related sepsis. During this study, the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [(G-CSF) filgrastim) was permitted, but not mandated, after the first course of treatment for patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia (xl,000 cells/mm3) or in those who developed neutropenic fever between cycles of chemotherapy. Beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy, G-CSF was started at a dose of 5 mcg/kg per day and continued until the total granulocyte count was >1000 cells/mm3 on 2 successive determinations. G-CSF was not administered on the day of treatment. Grade 3 and 4 anemia occurred more frequently in the combination arm compared to control, 24% vs. 8%, respectively. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 6% of patients treated with Vinorelbine Injection USP plus cisplatin compared to 2% of patients treated with cisplatin. The incidence of severe non-hematologic toxicity was similar among the patients in both treatment groups. Patients receiving Vinorelbine Injection USP plus cisplatin compared to single-agent cisplatin experienced more Grade 3 and/or 4 peripheral numbness (2% vs. <1%), phlebitis/thrombosis/embolism (3% vs. <1%), and infection (6% vs. <1%). Grade 3-4 constipation and/or ileus occurred in 3% of patients treated with combination therapy and in 1% of patients treated with cisplatin. Seven deaths were reported on the combination arm; 2 were related to cardiac ischemia, 1 massive cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of Vinorelbine Injection USP, and 3 from febrile neutropenia. One death, secondary to respiratory infection unrelated to granulocytopenia, occurred with single-agent cisplatin. Vinorelbine Injection USP plus Cisplatin versus Vindesine plus Cisplatin versus Single-Agent Vinorelbine (Table 4): Myelosuppression, specifically Grade 3 and 4 granulocytopenia, was significantly greater with the combination of Vinorelbine Injection USP plus cisplatin (79%) than with either single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP (53%) or vindesine plus cisplatin (48%), P<0.0001. Hospitalization due to documented sepsis occurred in 4.4% of patients treated with Vinorelbine Injection USP plus cisplatin: 2% of patients treated with vindesine and cisplatin, and 4% of patients treated with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was infrequent in patients receiving combination chemotherapy and no events were reported with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. The incidence of Grade 3 and/or 4 nausea and vomiting, alopecia, and renal toxicity were reported more frequently in the cisplatin-containing combinations compared to single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP. Severe local reactions occurred in 2% of patients treated with combinations containing Vinorelbine Injection USP; none were observed in the vindesine plus cisplatin arm. Grade 3 and 4 neurotoxicity was significantly more frequent in patents receiving vindesine plus cisplatin (17%) compared to Vinorelbine Injection USP plus cisplatin (7%) and single-agent vinorelbine (9%) (P<0.005). Cisplatin did not appear to increase the incidence of neurotoxicity observed with single-agent Vinorelbine Injection USP.

Observed During Clinical Practice: in addition to the adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of Vinorelbine Injection USP. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to Vinorelbine Injection USP. Body as a Whole: Systemic allergic reactions reported as anaphylaxis, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema; flushing; and radiation recall events such as dermatitis and esophagitis (see PRECAUTIONS) have been reported. Hematologic: Thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolus and deep venous thrombosis, have been reported primarily in seriously ill and debilitated patients with known predisposing risk factors for these events. Neurologic: Peripheral neurotoxicities such as, but not limited to, muscle weakness and disturbance of gait; have been observed in patients with and without prior symptoms. There may be increased potential for neurotoxicity in patients with pre-existing neuropathy, regardless of etiology, who receive Vinorelbine Injection USP. Vestibular and auditory deficits have been observed with Vinorelbine Injection USP, usually when used in combination with cisplatin. Skin: Injection site reactions, including localized rash and urticaria, blister formation, and skin sloughing have been observed in clinical practice. Some of these reactions may be delayed in appearance. Gastrointestinal: Dysphagia, mucositis, and pancreatitis have been reported. Cardiovascular: Hypertension, hypotension, vasodilation, trichycardia, and pulmonary edema have been reported. Pulmonary: Pneumonia has been reported. Musculoskeletal: Headache has been reported, with and without other musculosketetal aches and pains. Other: Pain in tumor-containing tissue, back pain, and abdominal pain have been reported. Electrolyte abnormalities, including hyponatremia with or without the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, have been reported in seriously ill and debilitated patients. Combination Use: Patients with prior exposure to paclitaxel and who have demonstrated neuropathy should he monitored closely for new or worsening neuropathy. Patients who have experienced neuropathy with previous drug regimens should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy while receiving Vinorelbine Injection USP. Vinorelbine Injection USP may result in radiosensitizing effects with prior or concomitant radiation therapy (see PRECAUTIONS)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions, which may include fatalities, are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: •Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] •Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] •Constipation and Bowel Obstruction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] •Extravasation Tissue Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )] •Neurologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] •Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20%) are neutropenia, anemia, liver enzyme elevation, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, constipation, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying designs and in different patient populations, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. Single Agent The data below reflect exposure to vinorelbine as a single agent administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on a weekly basis to 365 patients enrolled in 3 controlled studies for metastatic NSCLC and advanced breast cancer. The population included 143 previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients (Study 3) who received a median of 8 doses of vinorelbine. The patients were aged 32 to 79 (median 61 years), 71% were male, 91% Caucasian, 48% had adenocarcinoma histology. The data also reflect exposure to vinorelbine in 222 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer who received a median of 10 doses of vinorelbine. Vinorelbine is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer. Selected adverse reactions reported in these studies are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) of single agent vinorelbine were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, increased total bilirubin, AST elevation, injection site reaction and asthenia. Approximately 49% of NSCLC patients treated with vinorelbine experienced at least one dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Thirteen percent of patients discontinued vinorelbine due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to vinorelbine discontinuation were asthenia, dyspnea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, myasthenia and fever.

The majority of the remaining patients had received prior chemotherapy. Myelosuppression: In clinical trials, Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 69%, 9% and 1%, respectively of patients receiving single-agent vinorelbine. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity. Neurotoxicity: neurotoxicity was most commonly manifested as constipation, paresthesia, hypersthesia, and hyporeflexia. Grade 3 and 4 neuropathy was observed in 1% of the patients receiving single-agent vinorelbine. Injection site reactions: Injection site reactions, including erythema, pain at injection site, and vein discoloration, occurred in approximately one third of patients; 5% were severe. Phlebitis (chemical phlebitis) along the vein proximal to the site of injection was reported in 10% of patients. Cardiovascular toxicity: Chest pain occurred in 5% of patients; myocardial infarction occurred in less than 0.1% of patients. Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Dyspnea (shortness of breath) was reported in 3% of patients; it was severe in 2%. Interstitial pulmonary changes were documented. Other: Hemorrhagic cystitis and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion were each reported in <1% of patients. In Combination with Cisplatin Table 3 presents the incidence of selected adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 10% of vinorelbine treated patients reported in a randomized trial comparing the combination of vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 administered every week of each 28-day cycle and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of each 28-day cycle versus cisplatin alone at the same dose and schedule in patients with previously untreated NSCLC (Study 1). Patients randomized to vinorelbine plus cisplatin received a median of 3 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin alone received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. Thirty-five percent of the eligible patients in the combination arm required treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction compared to 19% in the cisplatin alone arm. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly higher in the vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm (82%) compared to the cisplatin alone arm (5%). Four patients in the vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm died of neutropenic sepsis. Seven additional deaths were reported in the combination arm: 2 from cardiac ischemia, 1 cerebrovascular accident, 1 multisystem failure due to an overdose of vinorelbine, and 3 from febrile neutropenia.

A total of 604 patients received either vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 every week plus cisplatin 120 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 29, then every 6 weeks thereafter (N=207), vindesine 3 mg/m2 for 6 weeks, then every other week thereafter plus cisplatin 120 mg/m2 on Days 1 and Day 29, then every 6 weeks thereafter (N=193) or vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 every week (N=204). Patients randomized to vinorelbine plus cisplatin received a median of 15 weeks of treatment, vindesine plus cisplatin 12 weeks and vinorelbine received 13 weeks. Study discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was required in 27, 22 and 10% of the patients randomized to vinorelbine plus cisplatin, vindesine plus cisplatin and cisplatin alone arms, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was significantly greater in the vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm (78%) compared to vindesine plus cisplatin (48%) and vinorelbine alone (53%). Neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathy and constipation was reported in 44% (Grades 3 to 4, 7%) of the patients receiving vinorelbine plus cisplatin, 58% (Grades 3 to 4, 17%) of the patients receiving vindesine and cisplatin and 44% (Grades 3 to 4, 8.5%) of the patients receiving vinorelbine alone.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hepatic toxicity: monitor liver function during treatment (5.2) •Severe constipation and bowel obstruction including necrosis and perforation can occur. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation. Monitor for abdominal pain and severe constipation (5.3) •Extravasation can result in severe tissue injury, necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. Immediately stop vinorelbine and institute recommended management procedures (5.4) •Neurologic toxicity: severe sensory and motor neuropathies can occur. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy (5.5) •Pulmonary toxicity and respiratory failure can occur with use of vinorelbine. Monitor patients respiratory disorders: dyspnea and bronchospasm. Interrupt vinorelbine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea (5.6) •Embryo-fetal toxicity: can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.7, 8.1) 5.1 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia occur with vinorelbine as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with vinorelbine. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 53% of patients treated with vinorelbine at 30 mg/m2 per week. Dose adjustment due to myelosuppression occurred in 51% of patients (Study 2). In clinical trials with vinorelbine administered at 30 mg/m2 per week, neutropenia resulted in hospitalizations for pyrexia and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients. Neutropenia nadirs occur between 7 and 10 days after dosing with neutropenia count recovery usually occurring within the following 7 to 14 days. Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of vinorelbine. Do not administer vinorelbine to patients with neutrophil counts <1,000 cells/mm3. Adjustments in the dosage of vinorelbine should be based on neutrophil counts obtained on the day of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury manifest by elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin can occur in patients receiving vinorelbine alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of vinorelbine and periodically during treatment. Reduce the dose of vinorelbine for patients who develop elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times upper limit of normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.3 Severe Constipation and Bowel Obstruction Severe and fatal paralytic ileus, constipation, intestinal obstruction, necrosis, and perforation occur with vinorelbine administration. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners. 5.4 Extravasation and Tissue Injury Extravasation of vinorelbine can result in severe irritation, local tissue necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of vinorelbine and institute recommended management procedures [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Neurologic Toxicity Sensory and motor neuropathies, including severe neuropathies, occur in patients receiving vinorelbine. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, hyporeflexia and muscle weakness while receiving vinorelbine. Discontinue vinorelbine for NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater neuropathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including severe acute bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs with use of vinorelbine. Interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS included fatalities. The mean time to onset of interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS after vinorelbine administration was one week (range 3 to 8 days) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Interrupt vinorelbine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity. Permanently discontinue vinorelbine for confirmed interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Vinorelbine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy with vinorelbine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.7)]."
