        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Most common adverse reactions (>=3%, all severity grades) are headache, fatigue, dizziness and nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Compensated Liver Disease Assessment of adverse reactions is based on four studies (AI463014, AI463022, AI463026 and AI463027) in which 1720 subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and compensated liver disease received double-blind treatment with entecavir 0.5 mg/day (n=679), entecavir 1 mg/day (n=183), or lamivudine (n=858) for up to 2 years. Median duration of therapy was 69 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 63 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in Studies AI463022 and AI463027 and 73 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 51 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in Studies AI463026 and AI463014. The safety profiles of entecavir and lamivudine were comparable in these studies. The most common adverse reactions of any severity (>=3%) with at least a possible relation to study drug for entecavir-treated subjects were headache, fatigue, dizziness and nausea. The most common adverse reactions among lamivudine-treated subjects were headache, fatigue and dizziness. One percent of entecavir-treated subjects in these four studies compared with 4% of lamivudine-treated subjects discontinued for adverse events or abnormal laboratory test results. Clinical adverse reactions of moderate-severe intensity and considered at least possibly related to treatment occurring during therapy in four clinical studies in which entecavir was compared with lamivudine are presented in Table 3.

ULN=upper limit of normal. Among entecavir-treated subjects in these studies, on-treatment ALT elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and greater than 2 times baseline generally resolved with continued treatment. A majority of these exacerbations were associated with a >=2 log10/mL reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided with the ALT elevation. Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during treatment. Exacerbations of Hepatitis after Discontinuation of Treatment An exacerbation of hepatitis or ALT flare was defined as ALT greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times the subject's reference level (minimum of the baseline or last measurement at end of dosing). For all subjects who discontinued treatment (regardless of reason), Table 5 presents the proportion of subjects in each study who experienced post-treatment ALT flares. In these studies, a subset of subjects was allowed to discontinue treatment at or after 52 weeks if they achieved a protocol-defined response to therapy. If entecavir is discontinued without regard to treatment response, the rate of post-treatment flares could be higher [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Median time to off-treatment exacerbation was 23 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 10 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects. Decompensated Liver Disease Study AI463048 was a randomized, open-label study of entecavir 1 mg once daily versus adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily given for up to 48 weeks in adult subjects with chronic HBV infection and evidence of hepatic decompensation, defined as a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of 7 or higher [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Among the 102 subjects receiving entecavir, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any severity, regardless of causality, occurring through Week 48 were peripheral edema (16%), ascites (15%), pyrexia (14%), hepatic encephalopathy (10%) and upper respiratory infection (10%). Clinical adverse reactions not listed in Table 2 that were observed through Week 48 include blood bicarbonate decreased (2%) and renal failure (<1%). Eighteen of 102 (18%) subjects treated with entecavir and 18/89 (20%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil died during the first 48 weeks of therapy. The majority of deaths (11 in the entecavir group and 16 in the adefovir dipivoxil group) were due to liver-related causes such as hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through Week 48 was 6% (6/102) for subjects treated with entecavir and 8% (7/89) for subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil. Five percent of subjects in either treatment arm discontinued therapy due to an adverse event through Week 48. No subject in either treatment arm experienced an on-treatment hepatic flare (ALT >2 x baseline and >10 x ULN) through Week 48. Eleven of 102 (11%) subjects treated with entecavir and 11/89 (13%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL through Week 48. HIV/HBV Co-infected The safety profile of entecavir 1 mg (n=51) in HIV/HBV co-infected subjects enrolled in Study AI463038 was similar to that of placebo (n=17) through 24 weeks of blinded treatment and similar to that seen in non-HIV infected subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Subjects Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's Baraclude(R) (entecavir) tablets. However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of entecavir. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to entecavir exposure. Immune system disorders: Anaphylactoid reaction. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Lactic acidosis. Hepatobiliary disorders: Increased transaminases. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, rash."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus infection after discontinuation: Monitor hepatic function closely for at least several months. (5.1, 6.1) Co-infection with HIV: Entecavir is not recommended unless the patient is also receiving HAART. (5.2) Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: If suspected, treatment should be suspended. (5.3) 5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.2 Patients Co-infected with HIV and HBV Entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment. Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if entecavir is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therefore, therapy with entecavir is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving HAART. Before initiating entecavir therapy, HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients. Entecavir has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors, including entecavir, alone or in combination with antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside inhibitor exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogue inhibitors to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Lactic acidosis with entecavir use has been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures. Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis. Treatment with entecavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations)."

HIV/HBV Co-infected The safety profile of BARACLUDE 1 mg (n=51) in HIV/HBV co-infected subjects enrolled in Study AI463038 was similar to that of placebo (n=17) through 24 weeks of blinded treatment and similar to that seen in non-HIV infected subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Liver Transplant Recipients Among 65 subjects receiving BARACLUDE in an open-label, post-liver transplant trial [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)], the frequency and nature of adverse events were consistent with those expected in patients who have received a liver transplant and the known safety profile of BARACLUDE. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Subjects Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of BARACLUDE in pediatric subjects 2 to less than 18 years of age is based on two ongoing clinical trials in subjects with chronic HBV infection (one Phase 2 pharmacokinetic trial [AI463028] and one Phase 3 trial [AI463189]). These trials provide experience in 168 HBeAg-positive subjects treated with BARACLUDE for a median duration of 72 weeks. The adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with BARACLUDE were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of BARACLUDE in adults. Adverse drug reactions reported in greater than 1% of pediatric subjects included abdominal pain, rash events, poor palatability ("product taste abnormal"), nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of BARACLUDE. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to BARACLUDE exposure. Immune system disorders: Anaphylactoid reaction. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Lactic acidosis. Hepatobiliary disorders: Increased transaminases. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, rash.",

Compensated Liver Disease Assessment of adverse reactions is based on four studies (AI463014, AI463022, AI463026, and AI463027) in which 1720 subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and compensated liver disease received double-blind treatment with entecavir 0.5 mg/day (n=679), entecavir 1 mg/day (n=183), or lamivudine (n=858) for up to 2 years. Median duration of therapy was 69 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 63 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in Studies AI463022 and AI463027 and 73 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 51 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in Studies AI463026 and AI463014. The safety profiles of entecavir and lamivudine were comparable in these studies. The most common adverse reactions of any severity (>=3%) with at least a possible relation to study drug for entecavir-treated subjects were headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. The most common adverse reactions among lamivudine-treated subjects were headache, fatigue, and dizziness. One percent of entecavir-treated subjects in these four studies compared with 4% of lamivudine-treated subjects discontinued for adverse events or abnormal laboratory test results. Clinical adverse reactions of moderate-severe intensity and considered at least possibly related to treatment occurring during therapy in four clinical studies in which entecavir was compared with lamivudine are presented in Table 3.

A majority of these exacerbations were associated with a >=2 log10/mL reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided with the ALT elevation. Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during treatment. Exacerbations of Hepatitis after Discontinuation of Treatment An exacerbation of hepatitis or ALT flare was defined as ALT greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times the subject's reference level (minimum of the baseline or last measurement at end of dosing). For all subjects who discontinued treatment (regardless of reason), Table 5 presents the proportion of subjects in each study who experienced post-treatment ALT flares. In these studies, a subset of subjects was allowed to discontinue treatment at or after 52 weeks if they achieved a protocol-defined response to therapy. If entecavir is discontinued without regard to treatment response, the rate of post-treatment flares could be higher. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] Table 5: Exacerbations of Hepatitis During Off-Treatment Follow-up, Subjects in Studies AI463022, AI463027, and AI463026 Subjects with ALT Elevations >10 × ULN and >2 × Referencea Entecavir Lamivudine a Reference is the minimum of the baseline or last measurement at end of dosing. Median time to off-treatment exacerbation was 23 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 10 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects. Nucleoside-inhibitor-naive HBeAg-positive 4/174 (2%) 13/147 (9%) HBeAg-negative 24/302 (8%) 30/270 (11%) Lamivudine-refractory 6/52 (12%) 0/16 Decompensated Liver Disease Study AI463048 was a randomized, open-label study of entecavir 1 mg once daily versus adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily given for up to 48 weeks in adult subjects with chronic HBV infection and evidence of hepatic decompensation, defined as a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of 7 or higher [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Among the 102 subjects receiving entecavir, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any severity, regardless of causality, occurring through Week 48 were peripheral edema (16%), ascites (15%), pyrexia (14%), hepatic encephalopathy (10%), and upper respiratory infection (10%). Clinical adverse reactions not listed in Table 3 that were observed through Week 48 include blood bicarbonate decreased (2%) and renal failure (<1%). Eighteen of 102 (18%) subjects treated with entecavir and 18/89 (20%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil died during the first 48 weeks of therapy. The majority of deaths (11 in the entecavir group and 16 in the adefovir dipivoxil group) were due to liver-related causes such as hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through Week 48 was 6% (6/102) for subjects treated with entecavir and 8% (7/89) for subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil. Five percent of subjects in either treatment arm discontinued therapy due to an adverse event through Week 48. No subject in either treatment arm experienced an on-treatment hepatic flare (ALT >2 × baseline and >10 × ULN) through Week 48. Eleven of 102 (11%) subjects treated with entecavir and 11/89 (13%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL through Week 48. HIV/HBV Co-infected The safety profile of entecavir 1 mg (n=51) in HIV/HBV co-infected subjects enrolled in Study AI463038 was similar to that of placebo (n=17) through 24 weeks of blinded treatment and similar to that seen in non-HIV infected subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Liver Transplant Recipients Among 65 subjects receiving entecavir in an open-label, post-liver transplant trial [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)], the frequency and nature of adverse events were consistent with those expected in patients who have received a liver transplant and the known safety profile of entecavir. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Subjects Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of entecavir in pediatric subjects 2 to less than 18 years of age is based on two ongoing clinical trials in subjects with chronic HBV infection (one Phase 2 pharmacokinetic trial [AI463028] and one Phase 3 trial [AI463189]). These trials provide experience in 168 HBeAg-positive subjects treated with entecavir for a median duration of 72 weeks. The adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with entecavir were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of entecavir in adults. Adverse drug reactions reported in greater than 1% of pediatric subjects included abdominal pain, rash events, poor palatability ("product taste abnormal"), nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of entecavir. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to entecavir exposure. Immune system disorders: Anaphylactoid reaction. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Lactic acidosis. Hepatobiliary disorders: Increased transaminases. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, rash.",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus infection after discontinuation: Monitor hepatic function closely for at least several months. (5.1, 6.1) -Co-infection with HIV: Entecavir is not recommended unless the patient is also receiving HAART. (5.2) -Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: If suspected, treatment should be suspended. (5.3) 5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.2 Patients Co-infected with HIV and HBV Entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment. Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if entecavir is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therefore, therapy with entecavir is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving HAART. Before initiating entecavir therapy, HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients. Entecavir has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors, including entecavir, alone or in combination with antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside inhibitor exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogue inhibitors to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Lactic acidosis with entecavir use has been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures. Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis. Treatment with entecavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).",

Median duration of therapy was 69 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 63 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in Studies AI463022 and AI463027 and 73 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 51 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in Studies AI463026 and AI463014. The safety profiles of entecavir and lamivudine were comparable in these studies. The most common adverse reactions of any severity (>=3%) with at least a possible relation to study drug for entecavir-treated subjects were headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. The most common adverse reactions among lamivudine-treated subjects were headache, fatigue, and dizziness. One percent of entecavir-treated subjects in these four studies compared with 4% of lamivudine-treated subjects discontinued for adverse events or abnormal laboratory test results. Clinical adverse reactions of moderate-severe intensity and considered at least possibly related to treatment occurring during therapy in four clinical studies in which entecavir was compared with lamivudine are presented in Table 3.

A majority of these exacerbations were associated with a >=2 log10/mL reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided with the ALT elevation. Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during treatment. Exacerbations of Hepatitis after Discontinuation of Treatment An exacerbation of hepatitis or ALT flare was defined as ALT greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times the subject's reference level (minimum of the baseline or last measurement at end of dosing). For all subjects who discontinued treatment (regardless of reason), Table 5 presents the proportion of subjects in each study who experienced post-treatment ALT flares. In these studies, a subset of subjects was allowed to discontinue treatment at or after 52 weeks if they achieved a protocol-defined response to therapy. If entecavir is discontinued without regard to treatment response, the rate of post-treatment flares could be higher. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] Table 5: Exacerbations of Hepatitis During Off-Treatment Follow-up, Subjects in Studies AI463022, AI463027, and AI463026 a Reference is the minimum of the baseline or last measurement at end of dosing.

Among the 102 subjects receiving entecavir, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any severity, regardless of causality, occurring through Week 48 were peripheral edema (16%), ascites (15%), pyrexia (14%), hepatic encephalopathy (10%), and upper respiratory infection (10%). Clinical adverse reactions not listed in Table 2 that were observed through Week 48 include blood bicarbonate decreased (2%) and renal failure (<1%). Eighteen of 102 (18%) subjects treated with entecavir and 18/89 (20%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil died during the first 48 weeks of therapy. The majority of deaths (11 in the entecavir group and 16 in the adefovir dipivoxil group) were due to liver-related causes such as hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through Week 48 was 6% (6/102) for subjects treated with entecavir and 8% (7/89) for subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil. Five percent of subjects in either treatment arm discontinued therapy due to an adverse event through Week 48. No subject in either treatment arm experienced an on-treatment hepatic flare (ALT >2 x baseline and >10 x ULN) through Week 48. Eleven of 102 (11%) subjects treated with entecavir and 11/89 (13%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL through Week 48. HIV/HBV Co-infected The safety profile of entecavir 1 mg (n=51) in HIV/HBV co-infected subjects enrolled in Study AI463038 was similar to that of placebo (n=17) through 24 weeks of blinded treatment and similar to that seen in non-HIV infected subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Subjects Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's entecavir tablets. However, due to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of entecavir. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to entecavir exposure. Immune system disorders: Anaphylactoid reaction. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Lactic acidosis. Hepatobiliary disorders: Increased transaminases. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, rash."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus infection after discontinuation: Monitor hepatic function closely for at least several months. (5.1, 6.1) Co-infection with HIV: Entecavir is not recommended unless the patient is also receiving HAART. (5.2) Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: If suspected, treatment should be suspended. (5.3) 5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.2 Patients Co-infected with HIV and HBV Entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment. Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if entecavir is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therefore, therapy with entecavir is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving HAART. Before initiating entecavir therapy, HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients. Entecavir has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors, including entecavir, alone or in combination with antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside inhibitor exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogue inhibitors to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Lactic acidosis with entecavir use has been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures. Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis. Treatment with entecavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Since entecavir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], coadministration of entecavir with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either entecavir or the coadministered drug. Coadministration of entecavir with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not result in significant drug interactions. The effects of coadministration of entecavir with other drugs that are renally eliminated or are known to affect renal function have not been evaluated, and patients should be monitored closely for adverse events when entecavir is coadministered with such drugs."
