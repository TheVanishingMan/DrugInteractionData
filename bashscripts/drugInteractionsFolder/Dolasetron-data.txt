        "Drug Interactions The potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions posed by dolasetron and hydrodolasetron appears to be low for drugs commonly used in chemotherapy because hydrodolasetron is eliminated by multiple routes. See PRECAUTIONS, General for information about potential interaction with other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. When oral dolasetron (200 mg once daily) was coadministered with cimetidine (300 mg four times daily) for 7 days, the systemic exposure (i.e., AUC) of hydrodolasetron increased by 24% and the maximum plasma concentration of hydrodolasetron increased by 15%. When oral dolasetron (200 mg once daily) was coadministered with rifampin (600 mg once daily) for 7 days, the systemic exposure of hydrodolasetron decreased by 28% and the maximum plasma concentration of hydrodolasetron decreased by 17%. Caution should be exercised when ANZEMET is coadministered with drugs, including those used in chemotherapy, that prolong ECG intervals and/or cause hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. (see WARNINGS). In patients taking furosemide, nifedipine, diltiazem, ACE inhibitors, verapamil, glyburide, propranolol, and various chemotherapy agents, no effect was shown on the clearance of hydrodolasetron. Clearance of hydrodolasetron decreased by about 27% when dolasetron mesylate was administered intravenously concomitantly with atenolol. Dolasetron mesylate did not inhibit the antitumor activity of four chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) in four murine models. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In controlled clinical trials, 943 adult cancer patients received ANZEMET Tablets. These patients were receiving concurrent chemotherapy, predominantly cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin regimens. The following adverse events were reported in ≥2% of patients receiving either ANZEMET 25 mg or ANZEMET 100 mg tablets for prevention of cancer chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in controlled clinical trials (Table 3). Table 3. Adverse Events ≥2% from Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Studies Event ANZEMET 25 mg (N=235) 100 mg (N=227) Headache 42 (17.9%) 52 (22.9%) Fatigue 6 (2.6%) 13 (5.7%) Diarrhea 5 (2.1%) 12 (5.3%) Bradycardia 12 (5.1%) 9 (4.0%) Dizziness 3 (1.3%) 7 (3.1%) Pain 0 7 (3.1%) Tachycardia 7 (3.0%) 6 (2.6%) Dyspepsia 7 (3.0%) 5 (2.2%) Chills/Shivering 3 (1.3%) 5 (2.2%) In clinical trials, the following reported adverse events, assessed by investigators as treatment-related or causality unknown, occurred following oral or intravenous administration of ANZEMET in < 2% of adult patients receiving concomitant cancer chemotherapy: Cardiovascular: Hypotension; edema, peripheral edema. The following events also occurred and with a similar frequency as placebo and/or active comparator: Mobitz I AV block, chest pain, orthostatic hypotension, myocardial ischemia, syncope, severe bradycardia, and palpitations. See PRECAUTIONS section for information on potential effects on ECG. In addition, the following asymptomatic treatment-emergent ECG changes were seen at rates less than or equal to those for active or placebo controls: bradycardia, T wave change, ST-T wave change, sinus arrhythmia, extrasystole (APCs or VPCs), poor R-wave progression, bundle branch block (left and right), nodal arrhythmia, U wave change, atrial flutter/fibrillation. Furthermore, severe hypotension, bradycardia and syncope have been reported immediately or closely following IV administration. Dermatologic: Rash, increased sweating. Gastrointestinal System: Constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, anorexia; pancreatitis. Hearing, Taste and Vision: Taste perversion, abnormal vision, tinnitus, photophobia. Hematologic: Hematuria, epistaxis, prothrombin time prolonged, PTT increased, anemia, purpura/hematoma, thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactic reaction, facial edema, urticaria. Liver and Biliary System: Transient increases in AST (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) values have been reported as adverse events in less than 1% of adult patients receiving ANZEMET in clinical trials. The increases did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy and were not associated with symptomatic hepatic disease. Similar increases were seen with patients receiving active comparator. Hyperbilirubinemia, increased GGT. Metabolic and Nutritional: Alkaline phosphatase increased. Musculoskeletal: Myalgia, arthralgia. Nervous System: Flushing, vertigo, paresthesia, tremor; ataxia, twitching. Psychiatric: Agitation, sleep disorder, depersonalization; confusion, anxiety, abnormal dreaming. Respiratory System: Dyspnea, bronchospasm. Urinary System: Dysuria, polyuria, acute renal failure. Vascular (Extracardiac): Local pain or burning on IV administration; peripheral ischemia, thrombophlebitis/phlebitis. Postmarketing Experience There are reports of wide complex tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia and of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest following intravenous administration."
