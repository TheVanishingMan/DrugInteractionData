        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Commonly Observed The most commonly reported adverse events associated with the use of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine and codeine and not reported at an equivalent incidence by placebo-treated patients were nausea and/or abdominal pain, drowsiness, and dizziness. Associated with Treatment Discontinuation Of the 382 patients treated with Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine and Codeine in controlled clinical trials, three (0.8%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. One patient each discontinued treatment for the following reasons: gastrointestinal upset; lightheadedness and heavy eyelids; and drowsiness and generalized tingling. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials The following table summarizes the incidence rates of the adverse events reported by at least 1% of the Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine and Codeine treated patients in controlled clinical trials comparing the combination product to placebo, and provides a comparison to the incidence rates reported by the placebo-treated patients. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. Adverse Events Reported by at Least 1% of Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine and Codeine Treated Patients During Placebo Controlled Clinical Trials Incidence Rate of Adverse Events Body System/Adverse Event Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine and Codeine (N=382) Placebo N=(377) Central Nervous Drowsiness 2.4% 0.5% Dizziness/lightheadedness 2.6% 0.5% Intoxicated Feeling 1.0% 0% Gastrointestinal Nausea/Abdominal Pain 3.7% 0.8% Other Adverse Events Reported During Controlled Clinical Trials The listing that follows represents the proportion of the 382 patients exposed to butalbital, aspirin, caffeine and codeine while participating in controlled clinical trials who reported, on at least one occasion, an adverse event of the type cited. All reported adverse events, except those already presented in the previous table, are included. It is important to emphasize that, although the adverse events reported did occur while the patient was receiving the combination product, the adverse events were not necessarily caused by butalbital, aspirin, caffeine and codeine. Adverse events are classified by body system and frequency. “Frequent” is defined as an adverse event which occurred in at least 1/100 (1%) of the patients; all adverse events listed in the previous table are frequent. “Infrequent” is defined as an adverse event that occurred in less than 1/100 patients but at least 1/1000 patients. All adverse events tabulated below are classified as infrequent. Central Nervous: headache, shaky feeling, tingling, agitation, fainting, fatigue, heavy eyelids, high energy, hot spells, numbness, and sluggishness. Autonomic Nervous: dry mouth and hyperhidrosis. Gastrointestinal: vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and heartburn. Cardiovascular: tachycardia. Musculoskeletal: leg pain and muscle fatigue. Genitourinary: diuresis. Miscellaneous: pruritus, fever, earache, nasal congestion, and tinnitus. Voluntary reports of adverse drug events, temporally associated with Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine and Codeine, that have been received since market introduction and that were not reported in clinical trials by the patients treated with the combination product, are listed below. Many or most of these events may have no causal relationship with the drug and are listed according to body system. Central Nervous: Abuse, addiction, anxiety, depression, disorientation, hallucination, hyperactivity, insomnia, libido decrease, nervousness, neuropathy, psychosis, sedation,sexual activity increase, slurred speech, twitching, unconsciousness, vertigo. Autonomic Nervous: epitaxis, flushing, miosis, salivation. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, appetite increased, constipation, diarrhea, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal spasm, hiccup, mouth burning, pyloric ulcer. Cardiovascular: chest pain, hypotensive reaction, palpitations,syncope. Skin: erythema, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, hives, rash, toxic epidermal necrolysis. Urinary: kidney impairment, urinary difficulty. Miscellaneous: allergic reaction, anaphylactic shock, cholangiocarcinoma, drug interaction with erythromycin (stomach upset), edema. The following adverse drug events may be borne in mind as potential effects of the components of this product. Potential effects of high dosage are listed in the OVERDOSAGE section of this insert. Aspirin: occult blood loss, hemolytic anemia, iron deficiency anemia, gastric distress, heartburn, nausea, peptic ulcer, prolonged bleeding time, acute airway obstruction, renal toxicity when taken in high doses for prolonged periods, impaired urate excretion, hepatitis.

All reported adverse events, except those already presented in the previous table, are included. It is important to emphasize that, although the adverse events reported did occur while the patient was receiving Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP the adverse events were not necessarily caused by Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP. Adverse events are classified by body system and frequency. \"Frequent\" is defined as an adverse event which occurred in at least 1/100 (1%) of the patients; all adverse events listed in the previous table are frequent. \"Infrequent\" is defined as an adverse event that occurred in less than 1/100 patients but at least 1/1000 patients. All adverse events tabulated below are classified as infrequent. Central Nervous: headache, shaky feeling, tingling, agitation, fainting, fatigue, heavy eyelids, high energy, hot spells, numbness, and sluggishness. Autonomic Nervous: dry mouth and hyperhidrosis. Gastrointestinal: vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and heartburn. Cardiovascular: tachycardia. Musculoskeletal: leg pain and muscle fatigue. Genitourinary: diuresis. Miscellaneous: pruritus, fever, earache, nasal congestion, and tinnitus.

Caffeine administered concurrently with ketoprofen reduced the urine volume in four healthy volunteers. The clinical significance of this interaction in preterm neonates is not known. Interconversion between caffeine and theophylline has been reported in preterm neonates. The concurrent use of these drugs is not recommended."

Two were randomized to caffeine, and one placebo patient was “rescued” with open-label caffeine for uncontrolled apnea. Adverse events described in the published literature include: central nervous system stimulation (i.e., irritability, restlessness, jitteriness), cardiovascular effects (i.e., tachycardia, increased left ventricular output, and increased stroke volume), gastrointestinal effects (i.e., increased gastric aspirate, gastrointesti­nal intolerance), alterations in serum glucose (hypoglycemia and hyper­glycemia) and renal effects (increased urine flow rate, increased creatinine clearance, and increased sodium and calcium excretion). Published long-term follow-up studies have not shown caffeine to adversely affect neurological development or growth parameters."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Commonly Observed The most commonly reported adverse events associated with the use of Fiorinal with Codeine and not reported at an equivalent incidence by placebo-treated patients were nausea and/or abdominal pain, drowsiness, and dizziness. Associated with Treatment Discontinuation Of the 382 patients treated with Fiorinal with Codeine in controlled clinical trials, three (0.8%) discontinued treatment with Fiorinal with Codeine because of adverse events. One patient each discontinued treatment for the following reasons: gastrointestinal upset; lightheadedness and heavy eyelids; and drowsiness and generalized tingling. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials The following table summarizes the incidence rates of the adverse events reported by at least 1% of the Fiorinal with Codeine treated patients in controlled clinical trials comparing Fiorinal with Codeine to placebo, and provides a comparison to the incidence rates reported by the placebo-treated patients. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators.

All reported adverse events, except those already presented in the previous table, are included. It is important to emphasize that, although the adverse events reported did occur while the patient was receiving Fiorinal with Codeine, the adverse events were not necessarily caused by Fiorinal with Codeine. Adverse events are classified by body system and frequency. “Frequent” is defined as an adverse event which occurred in at least 1/100 (1%) of the patients; all adverse events listed in the previous table are frequent. “Infrequent” is defined as an adverse event that occurred in less than 1/100 patients but at least 1/1000 patients. All adverse events tabulated below are classified as infrequent. Central Nervous: headache, shaky feeling, tingling, agitation, fainting, fatigue, heavy eyelids, high energy, hot spells, numbness, and sluggishness. Autonomic Nervous: dry mouth and hyperhidrosis. Gastrointestinal: vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and heartburn. Cardiovascular: tachycardia. Musculoskeletal: leg pain and muscle fatigue. Genitourinary: diuresis. Miscellaneous: pruritus, fever, earache, nasal congestion, and tinnitus. Voluntary reports of adverse drug events, temporally associated with Fiorinal with Codeine, that have been received since market introduction and that were not reported in clinical trials by the patients treated with Fiorinal with Codeine, are listed below. Many or most of these events may have no causal relationship with the drug and are listed according to body system. Central Nervous: abuse, addiction, anxiety, depression, disorientation, hallucination, hyperactivity, insomnia, libido decrease, nervousness, neuropathy, psychosis, sedation, sexual activity increase, slurred speech, twitching, unconsciousness, vertigo. Autonomic Nervous: epistaxis, flushing, miosis, salivation. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, appetite increased, constipation, diarrhea, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal spasm, hiccup, mouth burning, pyloric ulcer. Cardiovascular: chest pain, hypotensive reaction, palpitations, syncope. Skin: erythema, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, hives, rash, toxic epidermal necrolysis. Urinary: kidney impairment, urinary difficulty. Miscellaneous: allergic reaction, anaphylactic shock, cholangiocarcinoma, drug interaction with erythromycin (stomach upset), edema.

        "Drug Interactions Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is known to be the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of caffeine. Therefore, caffeine has the potential to interact with drugs that are substrates for CYP1A2, inhibit CYP1A2, or induce CYP1A2. Few data exist on drug interactions with caffeine in preterm neonates. Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministra­tion of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimeti­dine and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbi­tal and phenytoin). Caffeine administered concurrently with ketoprofen reduced the urine volume in four healthy volunteers. The clinical significance of this interaction in preterm neonates is not known. Interconversion between caffeine and theophylline has been reported in preterm neonates. The concurrent use of these drugs is not recommended."

Three of the infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis during the trial died. All had been exposed to caffeine. Two were randomized to caffeine, and one placebo patient was “rescued” with open-label caffeine for uncontrolled apnea. Adverse events described in the published literature include: central nervous system stimulation (ie, irritability, restlessness, jitteriness), cardiovascular effects (ie, tachycardia, increased left ventricular output, and increased stroke volume), gastrointestinal effects (ie, increased gastric aspirate, gastrointestinal intolerance), alterations in serum glucose (ie, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia), and renal effects (increased urine flow rate, increased creatinine clearance, and increased sodium and calcium excretion). Published long-term follow-up studies have not shown caffeine to adversely affect neurological development or growth parameters. OVERDOSAGE Following overdose, serum caffeine levels have ranged from approximately 24 mg/L (a postmarketing spontaneous case report in which an infant exhibited irritability, poor feeding, and insomnia) to 350 mg/L. Serious toxicity has been associated with serum levels greater than 50 mg/L (see PRECAUTIONS – Laboratory tests and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Signs and symptoms reported in the literature after caffeine overdose in preterm infants include fever, tachypnea, jitteriness, insomnia, fine tremor of the extremities, hypertonia, opisthotonos, tonic-clonic movements, nonpurposeful jaw and lip movements, vomiting, hyperglycemia, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and elevated total leukocyte concentration. Seizures have also been reported in cases of overdose. One case of caffeine overdose complicated by development of intraventricular hemorrhage and long-term neurological sequelae has been reported. Another case of caffeine citrate overdose (from New Zealand; not caffeine citrate) of an estimated 600 mg caffeine citrate (approximately 322 mg/kg) administered over 40 minutes was complicated by tachycardia, ST depression, respiratory distress, heart failure, gastric distention, acidosis, and a severe extravasation burn with tissue necrosis at the peripheral intravenous injection site. No deaths associated with caffeine overdose have been reported in preterm infants. Treatment of caffeine overdose is primarily symptomatic and supportive. Caffeine levels have been shown to decrease after exchange transfusions. Convulsions may be treated with intravenous administration of diazepam or a barbiturate such as pentobarbital sodium."

        "Drug Interactions Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is known to be the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of caffeine. Therefore, caffeine has the potential to interact with drugs that are substrates for CYP1A2, inhibit CYP1A2, or induce CYP1A2. Few data exist on drug interactions with caffeine in preterm neonates. Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin). Caffeine administered concurrently with ketoprofen reduced the urine volume in four healthy volunteers. The clinical significance of this interaction in preterm neonates is not known. Interconversion between caffeine and theophylline has been reported in preterm neonates. The concurrent use of these drugs is not recommended."
