        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan injection in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of sumatriptan injection and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]."

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 US placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Migraine (Studies 2 and 3) a Includes injection site pain, stinging/burning, swelling, erythema, bruising, bleeding.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan succinate in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injections. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration × time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol: Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of IMITREX Injection or Tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with IMITREX Tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving IMITREX Tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. IMITREX Tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of IMITREX Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of IMITREX Tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used IMITREX Tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to IMITREX Tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations: Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia. Cardiovascular: Frequent were palpitations, syncope, decreased blood pressure, and increased blood pressure.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of IMITREX The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with IMITREX Injection and IMITREX Nasal Spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of IMITREX in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical Sensations: Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation.

Urogenital : Disorder of breasts, endometriosis, and renal calculus. Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Ear, Nose, and Throat: Deafness.

        "Drug Interactions Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS ). Migraine Prophylactic Medications There is no evidence that concomitant use of migraine prophylactic medications has any effect on the efficacy of sumatriptan. In 2 Phase III trials in the US, a retrospective analysis of 282 patients who had been using prophylactic drugs (verapamil n = 63, amitriptyline n = 57, propranolol n = 94, for 45 other drugs n = 123) were compared to those who had not used prophylaxis (N = 452). There were no differences in relief rates at 60 minutes postdose for sumatriptan succinate injection, whether or not prophylactic medications were used. Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is not ordinarily recommended. If the clinical situation warrants the combined use of sumatriptan and an MAOI, the dose of sumatriptan employed should be reduced (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions: Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and WARNINGS: Concomitant Drug Use )."

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see and ). CONTRAINDICATIONS PRECAUTIONS Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS (see , , and ) Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation CONTRAINDICATIONS WARNINGS PRECAUTIONS . Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see ). WARNINGS Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptane tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue ONZETRA Xsail if occurs (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not myocardial ischemia; evaluate high risk patients for CAD (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue ONZETRA Xsail if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemia and infarction events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue ONZETRA Xsail if occurs (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue ONZETRA Xsail if occurs (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia , Myocardial Infarction , and Prinzmetal’s Angin a The use of ONZETRA Xsail is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists, including ONZETRA Xsail, may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving ONZETRA Xsail. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, ONZETRA Xsail is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of ONZETRA Xsail in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of ONZETRA Xsail. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of ONZETRA Xsail. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue ONZETRA Xsail if these disturbances occur. ONZETRA Xsail is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest , Throa t , Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with 5-HT1 agonists including other products containing sumatriptan and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of ONZETRA Xsail is contraindicated in patients with known CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists including other products containing sumatriptan, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). ONZETRA Xsail is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. Discontinue ONZETRA Xsail if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including ONZETRA Xsail, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a non-coronary vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before using ONZETRA Xsail. Transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists including sumatriptan. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or combinations of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including ONZETRA Xsail, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue ONZETRA Xsail if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with ONZETRA Xsail. ONZETRA Xsail is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic Reactions Anaphylactic reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. ONZETRA Xsail is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. ONZETRA Xsail should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia. Cardiovascular Frequent were palpitations, syncope, decreased blood pressure, and increased blood pressure.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical Sensations Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation. Cardiovascular Abdominal aortic aneurysm, abnormal pulse, flushing, phlebitis, Raynaud syndrome, and various transient ECG changes (nonspecific ST or T wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle).

Urogenital Disorder of breasts, endometriosis, and renal calculus. Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. ADVERSE REACTIONS Blood Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see ), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. WARNINGS Ear, Nose, and Throat Deafness.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information: Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal's angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Chest, throat, neck, and/or jaw pain/tightness/pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Cerebrovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Other vasospasm reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Medication overuse headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and > placebo) were injection site reactions, tingling, dizziness/vertigo, warm/hot sensation, burning sensation, feeling of heaviness, pressure sensation, flushing, feeling of tightness, and numbness (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Migraine Headache: Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 US placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine subjects [Studies 2 and 3, see Clinical Studies (14.1)] following either a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by at Least 2% of Subjects and at a Greater Frequency Than Placebo in 2 Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials (Studies 2 and 3)The sum of the percentages cited is greater than 100% because subjects may have experienced more than 1 type of adverse reaction. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection and occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo groups are included.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache: In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache [Studies 4 and 5, see Clinical Studies (14.2)], no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan in subjects with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan, 0% placebo). Adverse Reactions Observed In Association With The Administration of ALSUMA: The safety of ALSUMA was evaluated in an open-label clinical trial evaluating the usability of ALSUMA during a migraine attack. Adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 5% or higher were injection site bruising (16%), injection site pain (6%), and injection site hemorrhage (6%)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue ALSUMA if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue ALSUMA if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemia and infarction events, peripheral vasospastic reactions. Discontinue ALSUMA if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue ALSUMA if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution if patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina ALSUMA is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. ALSUMA may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving ALSUMA. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, ALSUMA is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of ALSUMA in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following ALSUMA. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of ALSUMA. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue ALSUMA if these disturbances occur. ALSUMA is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with ALSUMA and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of ALSUMA is contraindicated in patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonists having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue ALSUMA if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. ALSUMA is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions ALSUMA may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional ALSUMA doses. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with ALSUMA, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue ALSUMA if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with ALSUMA. ALSUMA is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions There have been reports of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving ALSUMA. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. ALSUMA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to ALSUMA. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of ALSUMA. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. ALSUMA should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan injection in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of sumatriptan injection and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]."

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 US placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Migraine (Studies 2 and 3) a Includes injection site pain, stinging/burning, swelling, erythema, bruising, bleeding.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan succinate in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate if occurs (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injections. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Error Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan succinate tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan succinate tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical Sensations Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation.

Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information: •Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal’s angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] •Chest, throat, neck, and/or jaw pain/tightness/pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] •Cerebrovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] •Other vasospasm reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] •Medication overuse headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] •Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] •Increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] •Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] •Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% and > placebo) were paresthesia, warm/cold sensation, chest pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness, neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, other sensations of pain/pressure/tightness/heaviness, vertigo, and malaise/fatigue. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by at Least 2% of Patients Treated with Sumatriptan Tablets and at a Greater Frequency than Placebo Adverse Reaction Percentage of Patients Reporting Sumatriptan Tablets 25 mg (n = 417) Sumatriptan Tablets 50 mg (n = 771) Sumatriptan Tablets 100 mg (n = 437) Placebo Tablets (n = 309) Atypical sensations 5 6 6 4 Paresthesia (all types) 3 5 3 2 Sensation warm/cold 3 2 3 2 Pain and other pressure sensations 6 6 8 4 Chest-Pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1 2 2 1 Neck/throat/jaw-pain/tightness/pressure < 1 2 3 < 1 Pain-location specified 2 1 1 1 Other-pressure/tightness/heaviness 1 1 3 2 Neurological Vertigo < 1 < 1 2 < 1 Other Malaise/fatigue 2 2 3 < 1 The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan succinate injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological: Dystonia, tremor."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) •Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.2) •Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) •Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.4) •Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.5) •Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) •Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.7) •Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ) . Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptane tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia. Cardiovascular Frequent were palpitations, syncope, decreased blood pressure, and increased blood pressure. Infrequent were arrhythmia, changes in ECG, hypertension, hypotension, pallor, pulsating sensations, and tachycardia.

Sumatriptan succinate tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan succinate tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan succinate tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations : Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan Succinate: The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical Sensations : Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation.

Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan): The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular : Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Ear, Nose, and Throat : Deafness.

        "Drug Interactions Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS). Migraine Prophylactic Medications There is no evidence that concomitant use of migraine prophylactic medications has any effect on the efficacy of sumatriptan. In 2 Phase III trials in the US, a retrospective analysis of 282 patients who had been using prophylactic drugs (verapamil n = 63, amitriptyline n = 57, propranolol n = 94, for 45 other drugs n = 123) were compared to those who had not used prophylaxis (N = 452). There were no differences in relief rates at 60 minutes postdose for sumatriptan succinate injection, whether or not prophylactic medications were used. Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is not ordinarily recommended. If the clinical situation warrants the combined use of sumatriptan and an MAOI, the dose of sumatriptan employed should be reduced (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions: Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and WARNINGS: Concomitant Drug Use )."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS: Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events, and PRECAUTIONS: General ). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS: Increase in Blood Pressure ). Among patients in clinical trials of subcutaneous sumatriptan succinate injection (N = 6,218), up to 3.5% of patients withdrew for reasons related to adverse events. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of Migraine Headache Table 4 lists adverse events that occurred in 2 large US, Phase III, placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients following either a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan succinate injection or placebo. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan succinate injection 6-mg and occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 4. Table 4. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experience Incidence in 2 Large Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials: Events Reported by at Least 2% of Patients Treated with Sumatriptan Succinate Injection 6 mgThe sum of the percentages cited is greater than 100% because patients may experience more than 1 type of adverse event.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Incidence in Controlled Trials of Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing sumatriptan's efficacy as a treatment for cluster headache, no new significant adverse events associated with the use of sumatriptan were detected that had not already been identified in association with the drug's use in migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse events reported in the studies of cluster headache were generally lower. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo). Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Succinate Injection In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate injection in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided.

Migraine Headache: Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache: In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological: Dystonia, tremor."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non‑coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injections. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan succinate tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan succinate tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan succinate tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

        "WANRINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during co-­administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "Drug Interactions Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS). Migraine Prophylactic Medications: There is no evidence that concomitant use of migraine prophylactic medications has any effect on the efficacy of sumatriptan. In 2 Phase III trials in the US, a retrospective analysis of 282 patients who had been using prophylactic drugs (verapamil n = 63, amitriptyline n = 57, propranolol n = 94, for 45 other drugs n = 123) were compared with those who had not used prophylaxis (N = 452). There were no differences in relief rates at 60 minutes postdose for IMITREX Injection, whether or not prophylactic medications were used. Ergot-Containing Drugs: Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is not ordinarily recommended. If the clinical situation warrants the combined use of sumatriptan and an MAOI, the dose of sumatriptan employed should be reduced (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions: Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and WARNINGS: Concomitant Drug Use)."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of IMITREX Injection or Tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS: Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events, and PRECAUTIONS: General). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS: Increase in Blood Pressure). Among patients in clinical trials of subcutaneous IMITREX Injection (N = 6,218), up to 3.5% of patients withdrew for reasons related to adverse events. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of Migraine Headache Table 4 lists adverse events that occurred in 2 large US, Phase III, placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients following either a single 6-mg dose of IMITREX Injection or placebo. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with IMITREX Injection 6 mg and occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 4. Table 4. Treatment Emergent Adverse Experience Incidence in 2 Large Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials: Events Reported by at Least 2% of Patients Treated With IMITREX Injection 6 mga Adverse Event Percent of Patients Reporting IMITREX Injection 6 mg Subcutaneous (n = 547) Placebo (n = 370) Atypical sensations 42 9 Tingling 14 3 Warm/hot sensation 11 4 Burning sensation 7 <1 Feeling of heaviness 7 1 Pressure sensation 7 2 Feeling of tightness 5 <1 Numbness 5 2 Feeling strange 2 <1 Tight feeling in head 2 <1 Cardiovascular Flushing 7 2 Chest discomfort 5 1 Tightness in chest 3 <1 Pressure in chest 2 <1 Ear, nose, and throat Throat discomfort 3 <1 Discomfort: nasal cavity/sinuses 2 <1 Injection site reaction 59 24 Miscellaneous Jaw discomfort 2 0 Musculoskeletal Weakness 5 <1 Neck pain/stiffness 5 <1 Myalgia 2 <1 Neurological Dizziness/vertigo 12 4 Drowsiness/sedation 3 2 Headache 2 <1 Skin Sweating 2 1 aThe sum of the percentages cited is greater than 100% because patients may experience more than 1 type of adverse event. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with IMITREX Injection and occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo groups are included. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Incidence in Controlled Trials of Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing sumatriptan’s efficacy as a treatment for cluster headache, no new significant adverse events associated with the use of sumatriptan were detected that had not already been identified in association with the drug’s use in migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse events reported in the studies of cluster headache were generally lower. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% IMITREX, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% IMITREX, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% IMITREX, 0% placebo). Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of IMITREX Injection In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of IMITREX Injection in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients reporting an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,218) exposed to subcutaneous IMITREX Injection. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Cardiovascular: Infrequent were hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, palpitations, pulsating sensations, various transient ECG changes (nonspecific ST or T wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle), and syncope. Rare were pallor, arrhythmia, abnormal pulse, vasodilatation, and Raynaud syndrome. Endocrine and Metabolic: Infrequent was thirst. Rare were polydipsia and dehydration. Eye: Frequent was vision alterations. Infrequent was irritation of the eye. Gastrointestinal: Frequent were abdominal discomfort and dysphagia. Infrequent were gastroesophageal reflux and diarrhea.

Rare were muscle stiffness, need to flex calf muscles, backache, muscle tiredness, and swelling of the extremities. Neurological: Frequent was anxiety. Infrequent were mental confusion, euphoria, agitation, relaxation, chills, sensation of lightness, tremor, shivering, disturbances of taste, prickling sensations, paresthesia, stinging sensations, facial pain, photophobia, and lacrimation. Rare were transient hemiplegia, hysteria, globus hystericus, intoxication, depression, myoclonia, monoplegia/diplegia, sleep disturbance, difficulties in concentration, disturbances of smell, hyperesthesia, dysesthesia, simultaneous hot and cold sensations, tickling sensations, dysarthria, yawning, reduced appetite, hunger, and dystonia. Respiratory: Infrequent was dyspnea. Rare were influenza, diseases of the lower respiratory tract, and hiccoughs. Skin: Infrequent were erythema, pruritus, and skin rashes and eruptions. Rare was skin tenderness. Urogenital: Rare were dysuria, frequency, dysmenorrhea, and renal calculus. Miscellaneous: Infrequent were miscellaneous laboratory abnormalities, including minor disturbances in liver function tests, “serotonin agonist effect,” and hypersensitivity to various agents. Rare was fever. Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of IMITREX The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with IMITREX Tablets and IMITREX Nasal Spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of IMITREX in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Breasts: Breast swelling, cysts, disorder of breasts, lumps, masses of breasts, nipple discharge, primary malignant breast neoplasm, and tenderness.

Pain and Other Pressure Sensations: Chest pain and/or heaviness, neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, and pain (location specified). Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of IMITREX Injection in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Ear, Nose, and Throat: Deafness.

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1.

The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascularischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain andbloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experiencesymptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injections.1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injections. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan injection. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan injection. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Ergot-Containing Drugs: Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan succinate tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Sumatriptan succinate tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan succinate tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan succinate tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan Succinate: The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan): The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia.

All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical Sensations Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation. Cardiovascular Abdominal aortic aneurysm, abnormal pulse, flushing, phlebitis, Raynaud syndrome, and various transient ECG changes (nonspecific ST or T wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle). Chest Symptoms Chest discomfort. Endocrine and Metabolic Dehydration. Ear, Nose, and Throat Disorder/discomfort nasal cavity and sinuses, ear infection, Meniere disease, and throat discomfort. Eye Vision alterations. Gastrointestinal Abdominal discomfort, colitis, disturbance of liver function tests, flatulence/eructation, gallstones, intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, and retching. Injection Site Reaction Miscellaneous Difficulty in walking, hypersensitivity to various agents, jaw discomfort, miscellaneous laboratory abnormalities, “serotonin agonist effect,” swelling of the extremities, and swelling of the face. Mouth and Teeth Disorder of mouth and tongue (e.g., burning of tongue, numbness of tongue, dry mouth). Musculoskeletal Arthritis, backache, intervertebral disc disorder, neck pain/stiffness, need to flex calf muscles, and various joint disturbances (pain, stiffness, swelling, ache). Neurological Bad/unusual taste, chills, diplegia, disturbance of emotions, sedation, globus hystericus, intoxication, myoclonia, neoplasm of pituitary, relaxation, sensation of lightness, simultaneous hot and cold sensations, stinging sensations, stress, tickling sensations, transient hemiplegia, and yawning. Respiratory Influenza and diseases of the lower respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract infection. Skin Skin eruption, herpes, and peeling of the skin. Urogenital Disorder of breasts, endometriosis, and renal calculus. Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Ear, Nose, and Throat Deafness. Eye Ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal artery occlusion, retinal vein thrombosis, loss of vision. Gastrointestinal Ischemic colitis with rectal bleeding (see WARNINGS), xerostomia. Hepatic Elevated liver function tests. Neurological Central nervous system vasculitis, cerebrovascular accident, dysphasia, serotonin syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage. Non-Site Specific Angioneurotic edema, cyanosis, death (see WARNINGS), temporal arteritis. Psychiatry Panic disorder. Respiratory Bronchospasm in patients with and without a history of asthma. Skin Exacerbation of sunburn, hypersensitivity reactions (allergic vasculitis, erythema, pruritus, rash, shortness of breath, urticaria; in addition, severe anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported [see WARNINGS]), photosensitivity. Urogenital Acute renal failure."

Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with IMITREX Tablets and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to IMITREX or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological: Dystonia, tremor."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) •Arrhythmias: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs. (5.2) •Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) •Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs. (5.4) •Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs. (5.5) •Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) •Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs. (5.7) •Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of IMITREX Tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of IMITREX Tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. IMITREX Tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving IMITREX Tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of IMITREX Tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of IMITREX Tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of IMITREX Tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue IMITREX Tablets if these disturbances occur. IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with IMITREX Tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of IMITREX Tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue IMITREX Tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions IMITREX Tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional IMITREX Tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5‑HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with IMITREX Tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue IMITREX Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with IMITREX. IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving IMITREX. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. IMITREX Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to IMITREX. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of IMITREX. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. IMITREX Tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection and occurred at a frequency greater than that of the placebo group are included. b Includes injection site pain, stinging/burning, swelling, erythema, bruising, bleeding. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the subjects. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache: In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ], no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan in subjects with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan, 0% placebo)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or stroke: Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemia or infarction events, or peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of Sumavel DosePro. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumavel DosePro may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving Sumavel DosePro. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of Sumavel DosePro in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following Sumavel DosePro. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of Sumavel DosePro. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if these disturbances occur. Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with Sumavel DosePro and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumavel DosePro, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional doses of Sumavel DosePro. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with Sumavel DosePro, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with Sumavel DosePro. Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving Sumavel DosePro. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to Sumavel DosePro. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of Sumavel DosePro. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumavel DosePro should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Reported by at Least 2% of Patients in Controlled Migraine Trialsa Adverse Event Type Percent of Patients Reporting Placebo (N = 309) Sumatriptan 25 mg (N = 417) Sumatriptan 50 mg (N = 771) Sumatriptan 100 mg (N = 437) Atypical sensations 4% 5% 6% 6% Paresthesia (all types) 2% 3% 5% 3% Sensation warm/cold 2% 3% 2% 3% Pain and other pressure sensations 4% 6% 6% 8% Chest - pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1% 1% 2% 2% Neck/throat/jaw - pain/ tightness/pressure <1% <1% 2% 3% Pain - location specified 1% 2% 1% 1% Other - pressure/tightness/ heaviness 2% 1% 1% 3% Neurological Vertigo <1% <1% <1% 2% Other Malaise/fatigue <1% 2% 2% 3% a Events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in the group treated with sumatriptan tablets and that occurred more frequently in that group than the placebo group. Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptane tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia. Frequent were palpitations, syncope, decreased blood pressure, and increased blood pressure. Infrequent were arrhythmia, changes in ECG, hypertension, hypotension, pallor, pulsating sensations, and tachycardia.

Rare were gastrointestinal bleeding, hematemesis, melena, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal pain, dyspeptic symptoms, dental pain, feelings of gastrointestinal pressure, gastritis, gastroenteritis, hypersalivation, abdominal distention, oral itching and irritation, salivary gland swelling, and swallowing disorders. Rare was anemia. Frequent was myalgia. Infrequent was muscle cramps. Rare were tetany; muscle atrophy, weakness, and tiredness; arthralgia and articular rheumatitis; acquired musculoskeletal deformity; muscle stiffness, tightness, and rigidity; and musculoskeletal inflammation. Frequent were phonophobia and photophobia. Infrequent were confusion, depression, difficulty concentrating, disturbance of smell, dysarthria, euphoria, facial pain, heat sensitivity, incoordination, lacrimation, monoplegia, sleep disturbance, shivering, syncope, and tremor.

Infrequent were dysmenorrhea, increased urination, and intermenstrual bleeding. Rare were abortion and hematuria, urinary frequency, bladder inflammation, micturition disorders, urethritis, urinary infections, menstruation symptoms, abnormal menstrual cycle, inflammation of fallopian tubes, and menstrual cycle symptoms. Frequent was hypersensitivity. Infrequent were fever, fluid retention, and overdose. Rare were edema, hematoma, lymphadenopathy, speech disturbance, voice disturbances, contusions. The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation. Abdominal aortic aneurysm, abnormal pulse, flushing, phlebitis, Raynaud syndrome, and various transient ECG changes (nonspecific ST or T wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle). Chest discomfort. Dehydration. Disorder/discomfort nasal cavity and sinuses, ear infection, Meniere disease, and throat discomfort. Vision alterations.

Skin eruption, herpes, and peeling of the skin. Disorder of breasts, endometriosis, and renal calculus. The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS ), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Deafness.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking TREXIMET with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of TREXIMET and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended. (7.1) ACE Inhibitors and ARBs: Concomitant use with TREXIMET in elderly, volume depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function. (7.1) Diuretics: NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of loop and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to assure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects. (7.1) Digoxin: Concomitant use with TREXIMET can increase serum concentration and prolong half-life of digoxin. Monitor serum digoxin levels. (7.1) Lithium: Increases lithium plasma levels. (7.1) Methotrexate: Increases methotrexate plasma levels. (7.1) 7.1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with TREXIMET See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions with NSAIDs or Sumatriptan Table 3. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with naproxen or sumatriptan Ergot-Containing Drugs Clinical Impact: Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Intervention: Because these effects may be additive, coadministration of TREXIMET and ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors Clinical Impact: MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure of orally administered sumatriptan by 7-fold. Intervention: The use of TREXIMET in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated. Other 5-HT1 Agonists Clinical Impact: 5-HT1 agonist drugs can cause vasospastic effects. Intervention: Because these effects may be additive, coadministration of TREXIMET and other 5 HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Naproxen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of naproxen and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of TREXIMET with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)]. Aspirin Clinical Impact: Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Intervention: Concomitant use of TREXIMET and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)]. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Clinical Impact: Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Intervention: Discontinue TREXIMET if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: During concomitant use of TREXIMET and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. During concomitant use of TREXIMET and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of TREXIMET with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.12)]. Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of naproxen with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of TREXIMET and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of TREXIMET and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high-dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of TREXIMET and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of TREXIMET and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of naproxen with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Intervention: The concomitant use of naproxen with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of TREXIMET and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration. Probenecid Clinical Impact: Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Intervention: Reduce the frequency of administration of Treximet when given concurrently with probenecid. 7.2 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Blood Tests Naproxen may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time. This effect should be kept in mind when bleeding times are determined. Urine Tests The administration of naproxen sodium may result in increased urinary values for 17-ketogenic steroids because of an interaction between the drug and/or its metabolites with m-di-nitrobenzene used in this assay. Although 17-hydroxy-corticosteroid measurements (Porter-Silber test) do not appear to be artificially altered, it is suggested that therapy with naproxen be temporarily discontinued 72 hours before adrenal function tests are performed if the Porter-Silber test is to be used. Naproxen may interfere with some urinary assays of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5HIAA)."

Adults The adverse reactions reported below are specific to the clinical trials with TREXIMET 85/500 mg. See also the full prescribing information for naproxen and sumatriptan products. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials (Study 1 and 2) in adult patients who received 1 dose of study drug. Only adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with TREXIMET 85/500 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age In a placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age who received 1 dose of TREXIMET 10/60 mg, 30/180 mg, or 85/500 mg, adverse reactions occurred in 13% of patients who received 10/60 mg, 9% of patients who received 30/180 mg, 13% who received 85/500 mg, and 8% who received placebo. No patients who received TREXIMET experienced adverse reactions leading to withdrawal from the trial. The incidence of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was comparable across all 3 doses compared with placebo. Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred in a placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age at a frequency of 2% or more with TREXIMET and were more frequent than the placebo group.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue TREXIMET if occurs. (5.3) Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.4) Cerebrovascular Events: Discontinue TREXIMET if occurs. (5.5) Other Vasospasm Reactions: Discontinue TREXIMET if non-coronary vasospastic reaction occurs. (5.6) Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. (5.7) Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. (5.8) Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid use of TREXIMET in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. (5.9) Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.10) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue TREXIMET if occurs. (5.11) Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of TREXIMET in patients with advanced renal disease. (5.12) Anaphylactic Reactions: TREXIMET should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. Seep emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.(5.13) Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue TREXIMET at first sign of rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. (5.14) Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. (5.16) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). (5.17) 5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events The use of TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) and in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery due to increased risk of serious cardiovascular events with sumatriptan and NSAIDS [see Contraindications (4)]. Cardiovascular Events with Sumatriptan There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. TREXIMET may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events with Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)]. Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving TREXIMET. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, TREXIMET is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of TREXIMET in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of TREXIMET. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of TREXIMET. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of cardiovascular events, even in the absence of previous cardiovascular symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including naproxen, a component of TREXIMET, cause serious gastrointestinal adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only 1 in 5 patients who develop a serious upper gastrointestinal adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs appear to occur in approximately 1% of patients treated daily for 3 to 6 months and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for 1 year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. Among 3,302 adult patients with migraine who received TREXIMET in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 1 patient experienced a recurrence of gastric ulcer after taking 8 doses over 3 weeks, and 1 patient developed a gastric ulcer after treating an average of 8 attacks per month over 7 months. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing gastrointestinal bleeding compared with patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal gastrointestinal events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients, and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For high risk patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue TREXIMET until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.3 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue TREXIMET if these disturbances occur. TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.4 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.5 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue TREXIMET if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional TREXIMET. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Borderline elevations of 1 or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients who take NSAIDs including naproxen, a component of TREXIMET. Hepatic abnormalities may be the result of hypersensitivity rather than direct toxicity. These abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. Notable (3 times the upper limit of normal) elevations of SGPT (ALT) or SGOT (AST) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal cases of severe hepatic injury, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported with NSAIDs. TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with TREXIMET. TREXIMET should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash), or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flulike\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue TREXIMET immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. 5.8 Hypertension Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including sumatriptan, a component of TREXIMET. This occurrence has included patients without a history of hypertension. NSAIDs, including naproxen, a component of TREXIMET, can also lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with TREXIMET. TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.9 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of naproxen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of TREXIMET in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If TREXIMET is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Since each TREXIMET 85/500 mg tablet contains approximately 60 mg of sodium and each TREXIMET 10/60 mg tablet contains approximately 20 mg of sodium, this should be considered in patients whose overall intake of sodium must be severely restricted. 5.10 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.11 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with TREXIMET, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue TREXIMET if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.12 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, salt depletion, those taking diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. TREXIMET should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with renal disease develop or if systemic manifestations occur. TREXIMET is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] <30 mL/min) unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If TREXIMET is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Monitor renal function in patients with mild (CrCl = 60 to 89 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl = 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment, preexisting kidney disease, or dehydration. The renal effects of TREXIMET may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating TREXIMET. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of TREXIMET [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of TREXIMET in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If TREXIMET is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with the use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.13 Anaphylactic Reactions Anaphylactic reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to either component of TREXIMET. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens although anaphylactic reactions with naproxen have occurred in patient without known hypersensitivity to naproxen or to patients with aspirin sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.17)]. TREXIMET should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in patients with asthma who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)]. TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan, naproxen, or any other component of TREXIMET. Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.17)]. Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.14 Serious Skin Reactions NSAID-containing products can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions and to discontinue the use of TREXIMET at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.15 Premature Closure of the Ductus Arteriosus TREXIMET may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including TREXIMET, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.16 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in patients receiving NSAIDs. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross gastrointestinal blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with TREXIMET has signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including TREXIMET, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.17 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma [see Contraindications (4)]. When TREXIMET is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.18 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. TREXIMET should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. 5.19 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of TREXIMET in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.20 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.7, 5.12)]."

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptane tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia.

Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS ), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Ear, Nose, and Throat Deafness.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal’s angina [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Chest, throat, neck, and/or jaw pain/tightness/pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Cerebrovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Other vasospasm reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Medication overuse headache [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] Increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ] Most common adverse reactions (≥5% and > placebo) were injection site reactions, tingling, dizziness/vertigo, warm/hot sensation, burning sensation, feeling of heaviness, pressure sensation, flushing, feeling of tightness, and numbness. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zogenix, Inc. at 1-866-ZOGENIX or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Migraine Headache: Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 US placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine subjects [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported by at Least 2% of Subjects and at a Greater Frequency Than Placebo in 2 Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trialsa Percent of Subjects Reporting Adverse Reaction Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg Subcutaneous (n = 547) Placebo (n = 370) Atypical sensations Tingling Warm/hot sensation Burning sensation Feeling of heaviness Pressure sensation Feeling of tightness Numbness Feeling strange Tight feeling in head 42 14 11 7 7 7 5 5 2 2 9 3 4 <1 1 2 <1 2 <1 <1 Cardiovascular Flushing 7 2 Chest discomfort Tightness in chest Discomfort: nasal cavity/sinuses 5 3 2 1 <1 <1 Injection site reactionb 59 24 Miscellaneous Jaw discomfort 2 0 Musculoskeletal Weakness Neck pain/stiffness Myalgia 5 5 2 <1 <1 <1 Neurological Dizziness/vertigo Drowsiness/sedation Headache 12 3 2 4 2 <1 Skin Sweating 2 1 a The sum of percentages cited is greater than 100% because subjects may have experienced more than 1 type of adverse reaction.

The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the subjects. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache: In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ], no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan in subjects with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan, 0% placebo)."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or stroke: Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemia or infarction events, or peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of Sumavel DosePro. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumavel DosePro may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving Sumavel DosePro. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of Sumavel DosePro in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following Sumavel DosePro. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of Sumavel DosePro. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if these disturbances occur. Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with Sumavel DosePro and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumavel DosePro, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional doses of Sumavel DosePro. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with Sumavel DosePro, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue Sumavel DosePro if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with Sumavel DosePro. Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions There have been reports of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving Sumavel DosePro. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumavel DosePro is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to Sumavel DosePro. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of Sumavel DosePro. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumavel DosePro should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan succinate tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Sumatriptan succinate tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan succinate tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan succinate tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations : Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia.

For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during co-­administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of IMITREX Injection or Tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with IMITREX Tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving IMITREX Tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. IMITREX Tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of IMITREX Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of IMITREX Tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used IMITREX Tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to IMITREX Tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of IMITREX The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with IMITREX Injection and IMITREX Nasal Spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of IMITREX in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical Sensations: Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation.

Urogenital: Disorder of breasts, endometriosis, and renal calculus. Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Ear, Nose, and Throat: Deafness.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( ) 5.1 Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( ) 5.2 Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( ) 5.3 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( ) 5.4 Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( ) 5.5 Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( ) 5.6 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( ) 5.7 Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( ) 5.10 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 1 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 1 1 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT agonists have not been clearly established. 1 1 1 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during co-­administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. [see ] Drug Interactions (7.4) 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 1 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptane tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ).

Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see ). WARNINGS Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical Sensations Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information: ·Allergic Contact Dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] ·Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal’s angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] ·Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] ·Chest, throat, neck, and/or jaw pain/tightness/pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] ·Cerebrovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] ·Other vasospasm reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] ·Medication overuse headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] ·Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] ·Increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] ·Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] Most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) were application site pain, paresthesia, pruritus, warmth, and discomfort (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-483-8279 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In two long-term, open-label studies in which patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, 15% (99 out of 662) withdrew from the study because of adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to withdrawal from the study were contact dermatitis (4%) and application site pain (4%). The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) in a controlled single dose study were application site pain, paresthesia, pruritus, warmth, and discomfort. Controlled single dose acute migraine study Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or greater in a controlled clinical study of ZECUITY in patients with acute migraine (Study 1) [] In that study, patients randomized to the control group used the same activated iontophoretic transdermal delivery system (TDS) as patients randomized to ZECUITY, with the only difference being the absence of sumatriptan in the drug reservoir. Therefore, patients in the control group were exposed to same TDS-related risks as patients in the ZECUITY group, minus the risks related to sumatriptan. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in patients treated with ZECUITY or control are included in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported by at least 2% of Patients in Study 1 Adverse Reaction Percent of Subjects Reporting ZECUITY (n = 234) Control (n = 235) Application site pain Application site paresthesia Application site pruritus Application site warmth Application site discomfort Application site irritation Application site discoloration 26% 9% 8% 6% 6% 4% 3% 17% 16% 7% 3% 6% 2% 1% The incidence of “atypical sensations” adverse events (paresthesia, sensation warm/cold) and “pain and other pressure sensations” (chest pain/tightness/pressure/heaviness or neck/throat/jaw pain, tightness, pressure or heaviness) was 2% each in ZECUITY-treated patients, vs. 0% in the control group. Application site bruising was reported in 2 ZECUITY-treated patients (0.9%) vs. no patient in the control group. Subgroup analyses of age (≤41 years, >41 years), race (Caucasian, non-Caucasian) and body mass index (BMI) (≤25.7 mg/kg2, >25.7 mg/kg2) showed no difference between subgroups for adverse events. Skin Irritation Examination In Study 1, patients performed their own examination of the TDS application site at 4, 12, and 24 hours post TDS activation, and daily thereafter until resolution. Skin irritation examination scores are summarized in The median time to “no redness” was 2.6 days for ZECUITY compared with 0.3 day in the control group.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Magnetic Resonance Imaging procedure (MRI): ZECUITY contains metal parts and must be removed before an MRI procedure (5.1) • Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD): Discontinue ZECUITY if ACD is suspected (5.2) • Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.3) • Arrhythmias: Discontinue ZECUITY if occurs (5.4) • Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not myocardial ischemia; evaluate high risk patients for CAD (5.5) • Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue ZECUITY if occurs (5.6) • Gastrointestinal ischemia and infarction events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue ZECUITY if occurs (5.7) • Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.8) 5.1 Risk of Injury During Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Procedure ZECUITY contains metal parts and must be removed before an MRI procedure. 5.2 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of ZECUITY may lead to allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). In two long-term open-label studies where patients were allowed to treat multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year, the overall adverse event rate of ACD was 4%. ZECUITY should be discontinued if ACD is suspected. Erythema is commonly seen with use of ZECUITY and is not by itself an indication of sensitization. Following sensitization with ZECUITY, erythematous plaque and/or erythemato-vesicular or erythemato-bullous eruptions may develop. Clinical course is characterized by crescendo phenomenon of worsening pruritus and appearance over time with slower resolution to normal of affected skin areas. Patients sensitized from use of ZECUITY, as evidenced by development of ACD, may develop systemic sensitization or other systemic reactions if sumatriptan-containing products are taken via other routes, e.g., orally or subcutaneously. It is possible that some patients who developed ACD with sumatriptan by exposure to ZECUITY, and who have developed systemic sensitization, may not be able to take sumatriptan in any form. Patients who develop ACD with ZECUITY and require treatment with sumatriptan via other routes should receive their first subsequent dose under close medical supervision. 5.3 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of ZECUITY is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists, including ZECUITY, may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to using ZECUITY. Do not use ZECUITY if there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm [see Contraindications (4)]. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider using the first ZECUITY TDS in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) upon activation of ZECUITY. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of ZECUITY. 5.4 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue ZECUITY if these disturbances occur. ZECUITY is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.5 Chest, Throat, Neck and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the chest, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of ZECUITY is contraindicated in patients shown with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.6 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. ZECUITY is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.7 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including ZECUITY, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before using ZECUITY [see Contraindications (4)]. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.8 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.9 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including ZECUITY, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue ZECUITY if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.10 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with ZECUITY. ZECUITY is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.11 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. ZECUITY is contraindicated in patients with prior serious anaphylactic reaction. 5.12 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. ZECUITY should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. 5.13 Electrically-active Implantable or Body-worn Medical Devices ZECUITY should not be applied in areas near or over electrically-active implantable or body-worn medical devices (e.g., implantable cardiac pacemaker, body-worn insulin pump, implantable deep brain stimulator)."

Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan succinate tablets and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan succinate or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological: Dystonia, tremor."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan succinate tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan succinate tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan succinate tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan succinate. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan succinate. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan succinate. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan TabletsIn the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical SensationsFrequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia. CardiovascularFrequent were palpitations, syncope, decreased blood pressure, and increased blood pressure.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of SumatriptanThe following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan injection and nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical SensationsFeeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation. CardiovascularAbdominal aortic aneurysm, abnormal pulse, flushing, phlebitis, Raynaud syndrome, and various transient ECG changes (nonspecific ST or T wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle).

UrogenitalDisorder of breasts, endometriosis, and renal calculus. Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan)The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. BloodHemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. CardiovascularAtrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Ear, Nose, and ThroatDeafness.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of IMITREX Injection or Tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with IMITREX Tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Reported by at Least 2% of Patients in Controlled Migraine Trialsa Adverse Event Type Percent of Patients Reporting Placebo (N = 309) IMITREX 25 mg (N = 417) IMITREX 50 mg (N = 771) IMITREX 100 mg (N = 437) Atypical sensations 4% 5% 6% 6% Paresthesia (all types) 2% 3% 5% 3% Sensation warm/cold 2% 3% 2% 3% Pain and other pressure sensations 4% 6% 6% 8% Chest - pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1% 1% 2% 2% Neck/throat/jaw - pain/ tightness/pressure <1% <1% 2% 3% Pain - location specified 1% 2% 1% 1% Other - pressure/tightness/ heaviness 2% 1% 1% 3% Neurological Vertigo <1% <1% <1% 2% Other Malaise/fatigue <1% 2% 2% 3% aEvents that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in the group treated with IMITREX Tablets and that occurred more frequently in that group than the placebo group. Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving IMITREX Tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. IMITREX Tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of IMITREX Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of IMITREX Tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used IMITREX Tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to IMITREX Tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia. Cardiovascular Frequent were palpitations, syncope, decreased blood pressure, and increased blood pressure.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of IMITREX The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with IMITREX Injection and IMITREX Nasal Spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of IMITREX in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical Sensations Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation. Cardiovascular Abdominal aortic aneurysm, abnormal pulse, flushing, phlebitis, Raynaud syndrome, and various transient ECG changes (nonspecific ST or T wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle).

Urogenital Disorder of breasts, endometriosis, and renal calculus. Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Ear, Nose, and Throat Deafness.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information: •Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal’s angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] •Chest, throat, neck, and/or jaw pain/tightness/pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] •Cerebrovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] •Other vasospasm reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] •Medication overuse headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] •Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] •Increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] •Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] •Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% and > placebo) were paresthesia, warm/cold sensation, chest pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness, neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, other sensations of pain/pressure/tightness/heaviness, vertigo, and malaise/fatigue.

Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological: Dystonia, tremor."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) •Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.2) •Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) •Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.4) •Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.5) •Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) •Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.7) •Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: The use of TREXIMET in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions and CONTRAINDICATIONS). MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. In patients taking MAO-A inhibitors, sumatriptan plasma levels attained after treatment with recommended doses are 7-fold higher following oral administration than those obtained under other conditions. Ergot-Containing Drugs: Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (e.g., dihydroergotamine, methysergide) and TREXIMET within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Methotrexate: Caution should be used if TREXIMET is administered concomitantly with methotrexate. Naproxen sodium and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate. Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high-dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. Aspirin: When naproxen is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free naproxen is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAID-containing products, concomitant administration of TREXIMET and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS: Serotonin Syndrome). Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The use of TREXIMET in patients who are receiving ACE inhibitors may potentiate renal disease states (see WARNINGS: Renal Effects). Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS: Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. Lithium: NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when TREXIMET and lithium are administered concurrently, patients should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. Probenecid: Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly. Propranolol and Other Beta-Blockers: Propranolol 80 mg given twice daily had no significant effect on sumatriptan pharmacokinetics. Naproxen and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other beta-blockers. Warfarin: The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on gastrointestinal bleeding are synergistic, such that patients taking both drugs have a higher risk of serious gastrointestinal bleeding than patients taking either drug alone."

TREXIMET was generally well tolerated. Most adverse reactions were mild and transient. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Migraine Clinical Trials Associated With the Administration of TREXIMET The occurrence of less commonly reported adverse clinical events is presented in this section. Because the reports include events observed in an open-label, long-term safety study in which TREXIMET was used as needed for up to 12 months, the role of TREXIMET cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used TREXIMET and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 3,302) exposed to TREXIMET. Events listed in the previous table and text are not included below. Those events described too generally to be informative or those unlikely to be associated with the use of TREXIMET are excluded. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Blood and Lymphatic Disorders: Infrequent was lymphadenopathy. Rare were anemia, ecchymosis, leukopenia. Cardiac Disorders: Infrequent was tachycardia.

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Reported by at Least 2% of Patients in Controlled Migraine Trialsa Adverse Event Type Percent of Patients Reporting Placebo (N = 309) Sumatriptan 25 mg (N = 417) Sumatriptan 50 mg (N = 771) Sumatriptan 100 mg (N = 437) Atypical sensations 4% 5% 6% 6% Paresthesia (all types) 2% 3% 5% 3% Sensation warm/cold 2% 3% 2% 3% Pain and other pressure sensations 4% 6% 6% 8% Chest - pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness 1% 1% 2% 2% Neck/throat/jaw - pain/ tightness/pressure <1% <1% 2% 3% Pain - location specified 1% 2% 1% 1% Other - pressure/tightness/ heaviness 2% 1% 1% 3% Neurological Vertigo <1% <1% <1% 2% Other Malaise/fatigue <1% 2% 2% 3% a Events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in the group treated with sumatriptan tablets and that occurred more frequently in that group than the placebo group. Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptane tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia. Cardiovascular Frequent were palpitations, syncope, decreased blood pressure, and increased blood pressure. Infrequent were arrhythmia, changes in ECG, hypertension, hypotension, pallor, pulsating sensations, and tachycardia.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical Sensations Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation. Cardiovascular Abdominal aortic aneurysm, abnormal pulse, flushing, phlebitis, Raynaud syndrome, and various transient ECG changes (nonspecific ST or T wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle).

Urogenital Disorder of breasts, endometriosis, and renal calculus. Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS ), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Ear, Nose, and Throat Deafness.

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]."

Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during co-­administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan injection and sumatriptan nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Migraine (Studies 2 and 3) a Includes injection site pain, stinging/burning, swelling, erythema, bruising, bleeding.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injections. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS: Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events, and PRECAUTIONS: General). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS: Increase in Blood Pressure). Among patients in clinical trials of subcutaneous sumatriptan succinate Injection (N = 6,218), up to 3.5% of patients withdrew for reasons related to adverse events. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of Migraine Headache Table 4 lists adverse events that occurred in 2 large US, Phase III, placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan succinate Injection or placebo. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan succinate Injection 6 mg and occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 4. Table 4. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experience Incidence in 2 Large Placebo-Controlled Migraine Clinical Trials: Events Reported by at Least 2% of Patients Treated With Sumatriptan Succinate Injection 6 mg* * The sum of the percentages cited is greater than 100% because patients may experience more than 1 type of adverse event. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan succinate injection and occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo groups are included. Percent of Patients Reporting Adverse Event Sumatriptan succinate injection 6 mg Subcutaneous (n = 547) Placebo (n = 370) Atypical sensations 42 9 Tingling 14 3 Warm/hot sensation 11 4 Burning sensation 7 <1 Feeling of heaviness 7 1 Pressure sensation 7 2 Feeling of tightness 5 <1 Numbness 5 2 Feeling strange 2 <1 Tight feeling in head 2 <1 Cardiovascular Flushing 7 2 Chest discomfort 5 1 Tightness in chest 3 <1 Pressure in chest 2 <1 Ear, nose, and throat Throat discomfort 3 <1 Discomfort: nasal cavity/sinuses 2 <1 Injection site reaction 59 24 Miscellaneous Jaw discomfort 2 0 Musculoskeletal Weakness 5 <1 Neck pain/stiffness 5 <1 Myalgia 2 <1 Neurological Dizziness/vertigo 12 4 Drowsiness/sedation 3 2 Headache 2 <1 Skin Sweating 2 1 The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Incidence in Controlled Trials of Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing sumatriptan's efficacy as a treatment for cluster headache, no new significant adverse events associated with the use of sumatriptan were detected that had not already been identified in association with the drug's use in migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse events reported in the studies of cluster headache were generally lower. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo). Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of sumatriptan succinate injection In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate injection in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients reporting an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,218) exposed to subcutaneous sumatriptan succinate injection. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Cardiovascular Infrequent were hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, palpitations, pulsating sensations, various transient ECG changes (nonspecific ST or T wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle), and syncope. Rare were pallor, arrhythmia, abnormal pulse, vasodilatation, and Raynaud syndrome. Endocrine and Metabolic Infrequent was thirst. Rare were polydipsia and dehydration. Eye Frequent was vision alterations. Infrequent was irritation of the eye. Gastrointestinal Frequent were abdominal discomfort and dysphagia. Infrequent were gastroesophageal reflux and diarrhea. Rare were peptic ulcer, retching, flatulence/eructation, and gallstones. Musculoskeletal Frequent were muscle cramps. Infrequent were various joint disturbances (pain, stiffness, swelling, ache). Rare were muscle stiffness, need to flex calf muscles, backache, muscle tiredness, and swelling of the extremities. Neurological Frequent was anxiety. Infrequent were mental confusion, euphoria, agitation, relaxation, chills, sensation of lightness, tremor, shivering, disturbances of taste, prickling sensations, paresthesia, stinging sensations, facial pain, photophobia, and lacrimation. Rare were transient hemiplegia, hysteria, globus hystericus, intoxication, depression, myoclonia, monoplegia/diplegia, sleep disturbance, difficulties in concentration, disturbances of smell, hyperesthesia, dysesthesia, simultaneous hot and cold sensations, tickling sensations, dysarthria, yawning, reduced appetite, hunger, and dystonia. Respiratory Infrequent was dyspnea. Rare were influenza, diseases of the lower respiratory tract, and hiccoughs. Skin Infrequent were erythema, pruritus, and skin rashes and eruptions. Rare was skin tenderness. Urogenital Rare were dysuria, frequency, dysmenorrhea, and renal calculus. Miscellaneous Infrequent were miscellaneous laboratory abnormalities, including minor disturbances in liver function tests, \"serotonin agonist effect,\" and hypersensitivity to various agents. Rare was fever. Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of sumatriptan succinate The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate tablets and sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Breasts Breast swelling, cysts, disorder of breasts, lumps, masses of breasts, nipple discharge, primary malignant breast neoplasm, and tenderness.

Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan succinate Injection in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia.

Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological: Dystonia, tremor."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

( ) 5.4 Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( ) 5.5 Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( ) 5.6 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( ) 5.7 Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( ) 5.10 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan succinate tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 1 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 1 1 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan succinate tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT agonists have not been clearly established. 1 1 1 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan succinate tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 7.4 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 1 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan succinate. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan succinate. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan succinate. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Migraine Headache: Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 US placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine subjects (Studies 2 and 3), following either a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

(5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists, including ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection, may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.

However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection is contraindicated in patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not.

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol: Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations: Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia. Cardiovascular: Frequent were palpitations, syncope, decreased blood pressure, and increased blood pressure.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Atypical Sensations: Feeling strange, prickling sensation, tingling, and hot sensation.

Urogenital: Disorder of breasts, endometriosis, and renal calculus. Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. It is assumed, however, that systemic reactions following sumatriptan use are likely to be similar regardless of route of administration. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, colonic ischemia (see WARNINGS), Prinzmetal variant angina, pulmonary embolism, shock, thrombophlebitis. Ear, Nose, and Throat: Deafness.

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: The use of TREXIMET in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions and CONTRAINDICATIONS). MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. In patients taking MAO-A inhibitors, sumatriptan plasma levels attained after treatment with recommended doses are 7-fold higher following oral administration than those obtained under other conditions. Ergot-Containing Drugs: Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (e.g., dihydroergotamine, methysergide) and TREXIMET within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Methotrexate: Caution should be used if TREXIMET is administered concomitantly with methotrexate. Naproxen sodium and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate. Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high-dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. Aspirin: When naproxen is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free naproxen is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAID-containing products, concomitant administration of TREXIMET and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS: Serotonin Syndrome). Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The use of TREXIMET in patients who are receiving ACE inhibitors may potentiate renal disease states (see WARNINGS: Renal Effects). Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS: Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. Lithium: NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when TREXIMET and lithium are administered concurrently, patients should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. Probenecid: Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly. Propranolol and Other Beta-Blockers: Propranolol 80 mg given twice daily had no significant effect on sumatriptan pharmacokinetics. Naproxen and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other beta-blockers. Warfarin: The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on gastrointestinal bleeding are synergistic, such that patients taking both drugs have a higher risk of serious gastrointestinal bleeding than patients taking either drug alone."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse reactions reported below are specific to the clinical trials with TREXIMET. See also the full prescribing information for naproxen and sumatriptan products. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more with TREXIMET and were more frequent than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by at Least 2% of Patients in 2 Controlled Migraine Trialsa aEvents that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in the group treated with TREXIMET and that occurred more frequently in the group treated with TREXIMET than in the placebo group. Adverse Event Percent of Patients Reporting TREXIMET(n = 737) Placebo(n = 752) Sumatriptan 85 mg(n = 735) Naproxen Sodium 500 mg(n = 732) Nervous system disorders Dizziness 4 2 2 2 Somnolence 3 2 2 2 Paresthesia 2 <1 2 <1 Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea 3 1 3 <1 Dyspepsia 2 1 2 1 Dry mouth 2 1 2 <1 Pain and other pressure sensations Chest discomfort/chest pain 3 <1 2 1 Neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure 3 1 3 1 Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving TREXIMET and occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group included asthenia, feeling hot, muscle tightness, and palpitations. TREXIMET was generally well tolerated. Most adverse reactions were mild and transient. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Migraine Clinical Trials Associated With the Administration of TREXIMET The occurrence of less commonly reported adverse clinical events is presented in this section. Because the reports include events observed in an open-label, long-term safety study in which TREXIMET was used as needed for up to 12 months, the role of TREXIMET cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used TREXIMET and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 3,302) exposed to TREXIMET. Events listed in the previous table and text are not included below. Those events described too generally to be informative or those unlikely to be associated with the use of TREXIMET are excluded. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Blood and Lymphatic Disorders: Infrequent was lymphadenopathy. Rare were anemia, ecchymosis, leukopenia. Cardiac Disorders: Infrequent was tachycardia. Rare were acute coronary syndrome, cardiac flutter, congestive cardiac failure, right ventricular failure, ventricular extrasystoles. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Infrequent were ear pain, tinnitus.

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS: Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events, and PRECAUTIONS: General). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS: Increase in Blood Pressure). Among patients in clinical trials of subcutaneous sumatriptan succinate Injection (N = 6,218), up to 3.5% of patients withdrew for reasons related to adverse events. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of Migraine Headache Table 4 lists adverse events that occurred in 2 large US, Phase III, placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan succinate Injection or placebo. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan succinate Injection 6 mg and occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 4.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Incidence in Controlled Trials of Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing sumatriptan's efficacy as a treatment for cluster headache, no new significant adverse events associated with the use of sumatriptan were detected that had not already been identified in association with the drug's use in migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse events reported in the studies of cluster headache were generally lower. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan succinate, 0% placebo). Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of sumatriptan succinate injection In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate injection in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients reporting an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,218) exposed to subcutaneous sumatriptan succinate injection. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Cardiovascular Infrequent were hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, palpitations, pulsating sensations, various transient ECG changes (nonspecific ST or T wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle), and syncope. Rare were pallor, arrhythmia, abnormal pulse, vasodilatation, and Raynaud syndrome. Endocrine and Metabolic Infrequent was thirst. Rare were polydipsia and dehydration.

Rare was skin tenderness. Urogenital Rare were dysuria, frequency, dysmenorrhea, and renal calculus. Miscellaneous Infrequent were miscellaneous laboratory abnormalities, including minor disturbances in liver function tests, \"serotonin agonist effect,\" and hypersensitivity to various agents. Rare was fever. Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of sumatriptan succinate The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate tablets and sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan succinate in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache: In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache [Studies 4 and 5, see Clinical Studies (14.2)], no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan in subjects with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan, 0% placebo). Other Adverse Reactions: In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse reactions are presented. Reaction frequencies were calculated as the number of subjects reporting a reaction divided by the total number of subjects (N = 6,218) exposed to subcutaneous sumatriptan injection. All reported reactions are included except those already listed in the previous table. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 subjects, infrequent are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 subjects, and rare are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 subjects. Cardiovascular: Infrequent were hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, palpitations, and syncope. Rare was arrhythmia. Gastrointestinal: Frequent was abdominal discomfort. Musculoskeletal: Frequent were muscle cramps. Neurological: Frequent was anxiety. Infrequent were mental confusion, euphoria, agitation, tremor. Rare were myoclonia, sleep disturbance, and dystonia. Respiratory: Infrequent was dyspnea. Skin: Infrequent were erythema, pruritus, and skin rashes. Miscellaneous: Infrequent was \"serotonin agonist effect\". Adverse Events Observed With Other Formulations of Sumatriptan : The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan tablets and sumatriptan nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled trials, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined. All reported events are included except those already listed, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Cardiovascular: Angina, cerebrovascular lesion, heart block, peripheral cyanosis, phlebitis, thrombosis. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distention and colitis. Neurological: Convulsions, hallucinations, syncope, suicide, and twitching. Miscellaneous: Edema, hypersensitivity, swelling of extremities, and swelling of face. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia. Ear, Nose, and Throat: Deafness. Eye: Ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal artery occlusion, retinal vein thrombosis. Neurological: Central nervous system vasculitis, cerebrovascular accident, serotonin syndrome, subarachnoid hemorrhage. Non-Site Specific: Angioedema, cyanosis, temporal arteritis. Skin: Exacerbation of sunburn, hypersensitivity reactions (allergic vasculitis, erythema, pruritus, rash, shortness of breath, urticaria), photosensitivity. Following subcutaneous administration of sumatriptan, pain, redness, stinging, induration, swelling, contusion, subcutaneous bleeding, and, on rare occasions, lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) have been reported.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemia and infarction events, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.7) Increase in blood pressure: Monitor blood pressure. (5.8) Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. (5.9) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT1 agonists, including sumatriptan injection, may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan injection for the presence of CAD or Prinzmetal's angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure As with other 5-HT1 agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions 5-HT1 agonists, including sumatriptan injection, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. Until further evaluation, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including sumatriptan injection, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with prior serious anaphylactic reaction. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( ) 5.1 Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( ) 5.2 Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( ) 5.3 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( ) 5.4 Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( ) 5.5 Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( ) 5.6 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( ) 5.7 Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( ) 5.10 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 1 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 1 1 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT agonists have not been clearly established. 1 1 1 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during co-­administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. [see ] Drug Interactions (7.4) 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 1 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia. Cardiovascular Frequent were palpitations, syncope, decreased blood pressure, and increased blood pressure. Infrequent were arrhythmia, changes in ECG, hypertension, hypotension, pallor, pulsating sensations, and tachycardia. Rare were angina, atherosclerosis, bradycardia, cerebral ischemia, cerebrovascular lesion, heart block, peripheral cyanosis, thrombosis, transient myocardial ischemia, and vasodilation. Ear, Nose, and Throat Frequent were sinusitis, tinnitus; allergic rhinitis; upper respiratory inflammation; ear, nose, and throat hemorrhage; external otitis; hearing loss; nasal inflammation; and sensitivity to noise. Infrequent were hearing disturbances and otalgia. Rare was feeling of fullness in the ear(s). Endocrine and Metabolic Infrequent was thirst.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS). Incidence in Controlled Clinical TrialsTable 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients.

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan injection in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of sumatriptan injection and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]."

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injections. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan injection. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS )."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported by at Least 2% of Patients in Controlled Migraine Trials* Adverse Event Type Percent of Patients Reporting Placebo (N = 309) Sumatriptan 25 mg (N = 417) Sumatriptan 50 mg (N = 771) Sumatriptan 100 mg (N = 437) * Events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in the group treated with sumatriptan tablets and that occurred more frequently in that group than the placebo group.

Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptan tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Atypical Sensations Frequent were burning sensation and numbness. Infrequent was tight feeling in head. Rare were dysesthesia. Cardiovascular Frequent were palpitations, syncope, decreased blood pressure, and increased blood pressure.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

        "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 US placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6-mg dose of IMITREX Injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with IMITREX Injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of IMITREX Injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of IMITREX in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% IMITREX Injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% IMITREX Injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% IMITREX Injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of IMITREX Tablets, IMITREX Nasal Spray, and IMITREX Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal’s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (5.1) •Arrhythmias: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs (5.2) •Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk (5.3) •Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs (5.4) •Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs (5.5) •Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary (5.6) •Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue IMITREX if occurs (5.7) •Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina The use of IMITREX Injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of IMITREX Injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. IMITREX Injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving IMITREX Injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, IMITREX Injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of IMITREX Injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of IMITREX Injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of IMITREX Injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue IMITREX Injection if these disturbances occur. IMITREX Injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with IMITREX Injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of IMITREX Injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue IMITREX Injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. IMITREX Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions IMITREX Injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional IMITREX Injections. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with IMITREX Injection, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue IMITREX Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with IMITREX. IMITREX Injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving IMITREX. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. IMITREX Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to IMITREX. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of IMITREX. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. IMITREX Injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."
