Use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution has been associated with somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily Adverse experience information for azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution is derived from six placebo- and active-controlled, 2-day to 8-week clinical trials which included 391 patients, 12 years of age and older, with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily. In placebo-controlled efficacy trials, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution and vehicle placebo was 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively. Table 1 contains adverse reactions that were reported with frequencies ≥2% in the azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution 2 sprays per nostril twice daily treatment group and more frequently than placebo.

The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution and vehicle placebo was 0.0% and 0.8%, respectively. Bitter taste was reported in 8.3% of patients compared to none in the placebo group. Somnolence was reported in 0.4% of patients compared to none in the placebo group. A total of 176 patients 5 to 11 years of age were exposed to azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution at a dose of 1 spray each nostril twice daily in 3 placebo-controlled studies. In these studies, adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution than with placebo, and that were not represented in the adult adverse reactions table above include rhinitis/cold symptoms (17% vs 9.5%), cough (11.4% vs 8.3%), conjunctivitis (5.1% vs 1.8%), and asthma (4.5% vs 4.1%). Adverse Reactions <2% in Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution One or Two Sprays Per Nostril Twice Daily The following reactions were observed infrequently (<2% and exceeding placebo incidence) in patients who received azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution dosed at 1 or 2 sprays per nostril twice daily in U.S. clinical trials. Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, tachycardia. Dermatological: contact dermatitis, eczema, hair and follicle infection, furunculosis, skin laceration. Digestive: constipation, gastroenteritis, glossitis, ulcerative stomatitis, vomiting, increased SGPT, aphthous stomatitis, diarrhea, toothache. Metabolic and Nutritional: increased appetite. Musculoskeletal: myalgia, temporomandibular dislocation, rheumatoid arthritis. Neurological: hyperkinesia, hypoesthesia, vertigo. Psychological: anxiety, depersonalization, depression, nervousness, sleep disorder, thinking abnormal. Respiratory: bronchospasm, coughing, throat burning, laryngitis, bronchitis, dry throat, nocturnal dyspnea, nasopharyngitis, nasal congestion, pharyngolaryngeal pain, sinusitis, nasal dryness, paranasal sinus hypersecretion, post nasal drip. Special Senses: conjunctivitis, eye abnormality, eye pain, watery eyes, taste loss. Urogenital: albuminuria, amenorrhea, breast pain, hematuria, increased urinary frequency. Whole Body: allergic reaction, back pain, herpes simplex, viral infection, malaise, pain in extremities, abdominal pain, pyrexia. Vasomotor Rhinitis Adverse experience information for azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution is derived from two placebo-controlled clinical studies which included 216 patients 12 years and older with vasomotor rhinitis who received azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for up to 28 days. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution was not different from vehicle placebo was 2.8% vs 2.9%, respectively. The following adverse reactions were reported with frequencies ≥2% in the azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution treatment group and more frequently than placebo.

In controlled trials involving nasal and oral azelastine hydrochloride formulations, there were infrequent occurrences of hepatic transaminase elevations. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia."

ASTEPRO 0.1% The safety data described below reflect exposure to ASTEPRO 0.1% in 975 patients 6 months of age and older from 4 clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. In a 2-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled (Astelin® Nasal Spray; azelastine hydrochloride) clinical trial, 285 patients (115 males and 170 females) 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with ASTEPRO 0.1% one or two sprays per nostril daily. In the 12 month open-label, active-controlled (Astelin Nasal Spray) clinical trial, 428 patients (207 males and 221 females) 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis and/or nonallergic rhinitis were treated with ASTEPRO 0.1% two sprays per nostril twice daily. In a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 166 patients (101 males and 65 females) ages 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, with or without concomitant seasonal allergic rhinitis, were treated with ASTEPRO 0.1% one spray per nostril twice daily. In a 4-week clinical trial, 96 patients (51 males and 45 females) ages 6 months to 5 years of age with seasonal and/or perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with ASTEPRO 0.1% one spray per nostril twice daily. The racial and ethnic distribution for the 4 clinical trials was 80% white, 11% black, 8% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and 2% other. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older In the two week clinical trial, 835 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with one of six treatments: one spray per nostril of either ASTEPRO 0.1%, Astelin Nasal Spray or placebo twice daily; or 2 sprays per nostril of ASTEPRO 0.1%, Astelin Nasal Spray, or placebo twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were more common in the ASTEPRO 0.1% treatment groups (21-28%) than in the placebo groups (16-20%). Overall, less than 1% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions and withdrawal due to adverse reactions was similar among the treatment groups. Table 1 contains adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than or equal to 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with ASTEPRO 0.1% in the controlled clinical trial described above.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache, bitter taste, epistaxis, and nasopharyngitis and were generally similar between treatment groups. Focused nasal examinations were performed and showed that the incidence of nasal mucosal ulceration in each treatment group was approximately 1% at baseline and approximately 1.5% throughout the 12 month treatment period. In each treatment group, 5-7% of patients had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of nasal septal perforation or severe epistaxis. Twenty-two patients (5%) treated with ASTEPRO 0.1% and 17 patients (4%) treated with Astelin Nasal Spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. Children 6 to 11 years of age In a 4 week clinical trial, 489 patients ages 6 to 11 years with perennial allergic rhinitis, with or without concomitant seasonal allergic rhinitis, were treated with either ASTEPRO 0.1%, ASTEPRO 0.15% or placebo, one spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse events were similar in the ASTEPRO 0.15% group (24%), ASTEPRO 0.1% group (26%) and the placebo group (24%).

The most frequently (≥2%) reported adverse reactions were pyrexia, cough, epistaxis, sneezing, dysgeusia, rhinalgia, upper respiratory infection, vomiting, otitis media, contact dermatitis, and oropharyngeal pain. Overall, adverse events were slightly higher in the ASTEPRO 0.15% group (28%) compared to ASTEPRO 0.1% group (21%). Focused nasal examinations were performed and showed no incidence of nasal mucosal ulceration at any time point during the study. No patients had reports of nasal septal perforation. Overall, less than 3% of the combined ASTEPRO groups discontinued due to adverse events. ASTEPRO 0.15% The safety data described below reflect exposure to ASTEPRO 0.15% in 2114 patients (6 months of age and older) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis from 10 clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. In 8 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks duration, 1703 patients (646 males and 1059 females) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with ASTEPRO 0.15% one or two sprays per nostril once or twice daily. In the 12 month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 466 patients (156 males and 310 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with ASTEPRO 0.15% two sprays per nostril twice daily. Of these 466 patients, 152 had participated in the 4-week placebo-controlled perennial allergic rhinitis clinical trials. In a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 161 patients (87 males and 74 females) ages 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, with or without concomitant seasonal allergic rhinitis, were treated with ASTEPRO 0.15% one spray per nostril twice daily. In a 4-week clinical trial, 95 patients (59 males and 36 females) ages 6 months to 5 years of age with seasonal and/or perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with ASTEPRO 0.15% one spray per nostril twice daily. The racial distribution for the 10 clinical trials was 79% white, 14% black, 2% Asian, and 5% other. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older In the 7 placebo controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 week duration, 2343 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and 540 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with two sprays per nostril of either ASTEPRO 0.15% or placebo once or twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were more common in the ASTEPRO 0.15% treatment groups (16-31%) than in the placebo groups (11-24%).

Long-Term (12 Month) Safety Trial: In the 12 month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial, 466 patients (12 years of age and older) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with ASTEPRO 0.15% two sprays per nostril twice daily and 237 patients were treated with mometasone nasal spray two sprays per nostril once daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>5%) with ASTEPRO 0.15% were bitter taste, headache, sinusitis, and epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. In each treatment group, approximately 3% of patients had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Fifty-four patients (12%) treated with ASTEPRO 0.15% and 17 patients (7%) treated with mometasone nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. Children 6 months to 11 years of age See summary under ASTEPRO 0.1% 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of ASTEPRO 0.1% and ASTEPRO 0.15%, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, blurred vision, chest pain, confusion, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, dizziness, dyspnea, facial swelling, hypertension, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal burning, nausea, nervousness, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, sneezing, insomnia, sweet taste, tachycardia, and throat irritation. Additionally, the following adverse reactions have been identified during the post approval use of the Astelin brand of azelastine hydrochloride 0.1% nasal spray (total daily dose 0.55 mg to 1.1 mg).

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache, bitter taste, epistaxis, and nasopharyngitis and were generally similar between treatment groups. Focused nasal examinations were performed and showed that the incidence of nasal mucosal ulceration in each treatment group was approximately 1% at baseline and approximately 1.5% throughout the 12 month treatment period. In each treatment group, 5-7% of patients had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of nasal septal perforation or severe epistaxis. Twenty-two patients (5%) treated with Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.1% and 17 patients (4%) treated with Astelin Nasal Spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. Children 6 to 11 years of age In a 4 week clinical trial, 489 patients ages 6 to 11 years with perennial allergic rhinitis, with or without concomitant seasonal allergic rhinitis, were treated with either Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.1%, Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.15% or placebo, one spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse events were similar in the Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.15% group (24%), Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.1% group (26%) and the placebo group (24%). Overall, less than 1% of the combined Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray groups discontinued due to adverse events.

In 8 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks duration, 1703 patients (646 males and 1059 females) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.15% one or two sprays per nostril once or twice daily. In the 12 month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 466 patients (156 males and 310 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.15% two sprays per nostril twice daily. Of these 466 patients, 152 had participated in the 4-week placebo-controlled perennial allergic rhinitis clinical trials. In a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 161 patients (87 males and 74 females) ages 6 to 11 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis, with or without concomitant seasonal allergic rhinitis, were treated with Azelastine Hydrochloride 0.15% one spray per nostril twice daily.The racial distribution for the 9 clinical trials was 80% white, 13% black, 2% Asian, and 5% other. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older In the 7 placebo controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 week duration, 2343 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and 540 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with two sprays per nostril of either Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.15% or placebo once or twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were more common in the Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray 0.15% treatment groups (16-31%) than in the placebo groups (11-24%). Overall, less than 2% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions and withdrawal due to adverse reactions was similar among the treatment groups.

Ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) had no effect on azelastine pharmacokinetics. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac effects, as measured by the corrected QT interval (QTc), of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. Oral erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for seven days) had no effect on azelastine pharmacokinetics or QTc based on analyses of serial electrocardiograms. Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for seven days) interfered with the measurement of azelastine plasma concentrations; however, no effects on QTc were observed. No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

ADVERSE REACTIONS Vasomotor Rhinitis Adverse experience information for Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray is derived from two placebo-controlled clinical studies which included 216 patients who received Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray at a dose of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for up to 28 days. The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions in patients receiving Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray was not different from vehicle placebo (2.8% vs 2.9%, respectively). The following adverse events were reported with frequencies ≥ 2% in the Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray treatment group and more frequently than placebo. ADVERSE EVENT Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray n = 216 Vehicle Placebo n = 210 Bitter Taste 19.4 2.4 Headache 7.9 7.6 Dysesthesia 7.9 3.3 Rhinitis 5.6 2.4 Epistaxis 3.2 2.4 Sinusitis 3.2 1.9 Somnolence 3.2 1.0 Events observed infrequently (<2% and exceeding placebo incidence) in patients who received Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray (2 sprays/nostril twice daily) in U.S. clinical trials in vasomotor rhinitis were similar to those observed in U.S. clinical trials in seasonal allergic rhinitis. In controlled trials involving nasal and oral azelastine hydrochloride formulations, there were infrequent occurrences of hepatic transaminase elevations. The clinical relevance of these reports has not been established. In addition, the following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray and causal relationship with the drug is unknown: anaphylactoid reaction, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with DYMISTA. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4: May increase blood levels of fluticasone propionate. Ritanovir: Coadministration is not recommended. (5.6, 7.2) Other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole: use caution with coadministration. (5.6, 7.2) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of DYMISTA with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because somnolence and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.2 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) significantly increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure following administration of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Ketoconazole (also a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), administered in multiple 200 mg doses to steady-state, increased plasma exposure of fluticasone propionate, reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol, following administration of a single 1000 mcg dose of fluticasone propionate by oral inhalation route. Caution should be exercised when DYMISTA is coadministered with ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors."

Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older The safety data described below in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older reflect exposure to DYMISTA in 853 patients (12 years of age and older; 36% male and 64% female) with seasonal allergic rhinitis in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2-week duration. The racial distribution for the 3 clinical trials was 80% white, 16% black, 2% Asian, and 1% other. In the 3 placebo controlled clinical trials of 2-week duration, 3411 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with 1 spray per nostril of DYMISTA, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, fluticasone propionate nasal spray, or placebo, twice daily. The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same vehicle and device as DYMISTA and are not commercially marketed. Overall, adverse reactions were 16% in the DYMISTA treatment groups, 15% in the azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray groups, 13% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray groups, and 12% in the placebo groups. Overall, 1% of patients in both the DYMISTA and placebo groups discontinued due to adverse reactions. Table 1 contains adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than or equal to 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with DYMISTA in the seasonal allergic rhinitis controlled clinical trials.

Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age The safety data described below in children 6-11 years of age reflect exposure to DYMISTA in 152 patients (6-11 years of age; 57% male and 43% female) with seasonal allergic rhinitis in one double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 2-week duration. The racial distribution for the clinical trial was 69% white, 31% black, 2% Asian and 2% other. In the placebo-controlled clinical trial of 2-week duration, patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with 1 spray per nostril of DYMISTA or placebo, twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 16% in the DYMISTA treatment group, and 12% in the placebo group. Overall, 1% of patients in both the DYMISTA and placebo groups discontinued due to adverse reactions. Table 2 contains adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than or equal to 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with DYMISTA in the seasonal allergic rhinitis controlled clinical trial. Table 2.

Long-Term (12-Month) Safety Trial in Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older: In the 12-month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 404 Asian patients (240 males and 164 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with DYMISTA, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 12-month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, 404 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with DYMISTA 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 207 patients were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 2 sprays per nostril once daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 47% in the DYMISTA treatment group and 44% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 2%) with DYMISTA were headache, pyrexia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinitis, dysgeusia, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pain, diarrhea, and epistaxis. In the DYMISTA treatment group, 7 patients (2%) had mild epistaxis and 1 patient (<1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 1 patient (<1%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Eleven of 404 patients (3%) treated with DYMISTA and 6 of 207 patients (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. Long-Term (3-Month) Safety Trial in Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years of Age In the 3-month open label active-controlled clinical trial, 264 patients (60% male, 40% female) (80% white, 19% black, 4% Asian and 2% other) with allergic rhinitis were treated with DYMISTA, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 3-month, open label, active-controlled, safety trial in pediatric patients 6-11 years of age 264 patients (128 patients ≥6 to <9 years of age, and 136 patients ≥9 to <12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis (based on the Investigator’s assessment) were treated with DYMISTA, 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 89 patients (44 patients ≥6 to <9 years of age, and 45 patients ≥9 to <12 years of age) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 40% in the DYMISTA treatment group and 36% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥2%) with DYMISTA were epistaxis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, cough, pyrexia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, otitis externa, and urticaria. In the DYMISTA treatment group 23 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis and 3 patients (1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 8 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Four of 264 patients (2%) treated with DYMISTA and 3 of 89 (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. There were two reports of somnolence, one severe, among children taking DYMISTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported with DYMISTA or one of the components (azelastine and fluticasone). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, increased heart rate, palpitations Eye disorder: blurred vision, cataracts, conjunctivitis, dryness and irritation, eye swelling, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, vision abnormal, xerophthalmia Gastrointestinal disorders: nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site condition: aches and pain, application site irritation, chest pain, edema of face and tongue, fatigue, tolerance Immune system disorders: anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions which in rare instances were severe, hypersensitivity reactions Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: growth suppression [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] Nervous system disorders: disturbance or loss of smell and/ or taste, dizziness, involuntary muscle contractions, paresthesia, parosmia Psychiatric disorders: anxiety, confusion, nervousness Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, cough, dysphonia, dyspnea, hoarseness, nasal septal perforation, nasal discomfort, nasal dryness, nasal sores, nasal ulcer, sore throat, throat dryness and irritation, voice changes, wheezing Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: angioedema, erythema, face swelling, pruritus, rash, urticaria Vascular disorder: hypertension"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Somnolence: Avoid engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery when taking DYMISTA. (5.1) Avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants with DYMISTA because further decreased alertness and impairment of CNS performance may occur. (5.1) Epistaxis, nasal ulcerations, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing, Candida albicans infection. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. (5.2) Glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts: Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. (5.3) Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. (5.4) Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue DYMISTA slowly. (5.5) Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving DYMISTA. (5.7, 8.4) 5.1 Somnolence In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients (6 of 853 adult and adolescent patients and 2 of 416 children) taking DYMISTA in placebo controlled trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of DYMISTA. Concurrent use of DYMISTA with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.2 Local Nasal Effects In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks' duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with DYMISTA than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Instances of nasal ulceration and nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with DYMISTA. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of DYMISTA until healing has occurred. In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered intranasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with DYMISTA. Patients using DYMISTA over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. 5.3 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive DYMISTA (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the DYMISTA group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment). 5.4 Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Effects When intranasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of DYMISTA should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of intranasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Ritonavir and other strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of DYMISTA and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Use caution with the coadministration of DYMISTA and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving DYMISTA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

In controlled trials involving nasal and oral azelastine hydrochloride formulations, there were infrequent occurrences of hepatic transaminase elevations. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: anaphylaxis, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, confusion, dyspnea, facial edema, involuntary muscle contractions, nasal sores, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tolerance, urinary retention, vision abnormal and xerophthalmia."

(5.1) Alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants: Avoid concurrent use with azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray because further decreased alertness and impairment of CNS performance may occur. (5.1) 5.1 Somnolence in Activities Requiring Mental Alertness In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients taking azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray. Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]."

Cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased the mean Cmax and AUC of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) by approximately 65%. Ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) had no effect on azelastine pharmacokinetics. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac effects, as measured by the corrected QT interval (QTc), of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. Oral erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for seven days) had no effect on azelastine pharmacokinetics or QTc based on analyses of serial electrocardiograms. Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for seven days) interfered with the measurement of azelastine plasma concentrations; however, no effects on QTc were observed. No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Use of azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray) has been associated with somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The most common adverse reactions (>2% incidence) are: bitter taste, nasal discomfort, epistaxis, headache, sneezing, fatigue, and somnolence (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or www.perrigo.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. Azelastine HCl Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray), 0.1% The safety data described below reflect exposure to azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% in 713 patients 12 years of age and older from 2 clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. In a 2-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled (azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener; azelastine hydrochloride) clinical trial, 285 patients (115 males and 170 females) 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% one or two sprays per nostril daily. In the 12 month open-label, active-controlled (azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener) clinical trial, 428 patients (207 males and 221 females) 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis and/or nonallergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% two sprays per nostril twice daily. The racial and ethnic distribution for the 2 clinical trials was 82% white, 8% black, 6% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and <1% other. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older In the two week clinical trial, 835 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with one of six treatments: one spray per nostril of either azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1%, azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener or placebo twice daily; or 2 sprays per nostril of azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1%, azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener, or placebo twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were more common in the azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% treatment groups (21-28%) than in the placebo groups (16-20%). Overall, less than 1% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions and withdrawal due to adverse reactions was similar among the treatment groups. Table 1 contains adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than or equal to 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% in the controlled clinical trial described above. Long-Term (12 Month) Safety Trial: In the 12 month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial, 862 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic and/or nonallergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% two sprays per nostril twice daily or azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener two sprays per nostril twice daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache, bitter taste, epistaxis, and nasopharyngitis and were generally similar between treatment groups. Focused nasal examinations were performed and showed that the incidence of nasal mucosal ulceration in each treatment group was approximately 1% at baseline and approximately 1.5% throughout the 12 month treatment period. In each treatment group, 5-7% of patients had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports nasal septal perforation or severe epistaxis. Twenty-two patients (5%) treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% and 17 patients (4%) treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. Azelastine HCl Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray), 0.15% The safety data described below reflect exposure to azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% in 1858 patients (12 years of age and older) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis from 8 clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. In 7 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks duration, 1544 patients (560 males and 984 females) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% two sprays per nostril once or twice daily. In the 12 month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 466 patients (156 males and 310 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% two sprays per nostril twice daily. Of these 466 patients, 152 had participated in the 4-week placebo-controlled perennial allergic rhinitis clinical trials. The racial distribution for the 8 clinical trials was 80% white, 13% black, 2% Asian, and 5% other. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older In the 7 placebo controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 week duration, 2343 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and 540 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with two sprays per nostril of either azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% or placebo once or twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were more common in the azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% treatment groups (16-31%) than in the placebo groups (11-24%). Overall, less than 2% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions and withdrawal due to adverse reactions was similar among the treatment groups. Table 2 contains adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than or equal to 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% in the seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis controlled clinical trials. In the above trials, somnolence was reported in <1% of patients treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% (11 of 1544) or vehicle placebo (1 of 1339). Long-Term (12 Month) Safety Trial: In the 12 month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial, 466 patients (12 years of age and older) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% two sprays per nostril twice daily and 237 patients were treated with mometasone nasal spray two sprays per nostril once daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>5%) with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% were bitter taste, headache, sinusitis, and epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. In each treatment group, approximately 3% of patients had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Fifty-four patients (12%) treated with azelastine HCl nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% and 17 patients (7%) treated with mometasone nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. Pediatric use information for patients ages 6 to 11 years of age for treatment of allergic rhinitis, including seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis is approved for Meda Pharmaceuticals’ azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray product. However, due to Meda Pharmaceuticals’ marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because reductions in alertness and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.2 Erythromycin and Ketoconazole Interaction studies investigating the cardiac effects, as measured by the corrected QT interval (QTc), of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. Oral erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) had no effect on azelastine pharmacokinetics or QTc based on analyses of serial electrocardiograms. Ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for 7 days) interfered with the measurement of azelastine plasma concentrations on the analytic HPLC; however, no effects on QTc were observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and (12.3)]. 7.3 Cimetidine Cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased the mean Cmax and AUC of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) by approximately 65% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) has been associated with somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The most common adverse reactions (≥2% incidence) are: bitter taste, nasal discomfort, epistaxis, headache, sneezing, fatigue, and somnolence (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-667-4708 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% The safety data described below reflect exposure to azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% with sweetener in 713 patients 12 years of age and older from 2 clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. In a 2-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled (azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener; azelastine hydrochloride) clinical trial, 285 patients (115 males and 170 females) 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% with sweetener one or two sprays per nostril daily. In the 12 month open-label, active-controlled (azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener) clinical trial, 428 patients (207 males and 221 females) 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis and/or nonallergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% with sweetener two sprays per nostril twice daily. The racial and ethnic distribution for the 2 clinical trials was 82% white, 8% black, 6% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and <1% other. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older In the two week clinical trial, 835 patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with one of six treatments: one spray per nostril of either azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% with sweetener, azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener or placebo twice daily; or 2 sprays per nostril of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% with sweetener, azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener, or placebo twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were more common in the azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% with sweetener treatment groups (21-28%) than in the placebo groups (16-20%). Overall, less than 1% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions and withdrawal due to adverse reactions was similar among the treatment groups. Table 1 contains adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than or equal to 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% with sweetener in the controlled clinical trial described above. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥2% Incidence in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of 2 Weeks’ Duration with Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray), 0.1% in Adult and Adolescent Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis 1 spray twice daily 2 sprays twice daily Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) With Sweetener (N=139) Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) Without Sweetener (N=137) Vehicle Placebo (N=137) Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) With Sweetener (N=146) Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray) Without Sweetener (N=137) Vehicle Placebo (N=138) Bitter Taste 8 (6%) 13 (10%) 2 (2%) 10 (7%) 11 (8%) 3 (2%) Epistaxis 3 (2%) 8 (6%) 3 (2%) 4 (3%) 3 (2%) 0 (0%) Headache 2 (1%) 5 (4%) 1 (<1%) 4 (3%) 3 (2%) 1 (<1%) Nasal Discomfort 0 (0%) 3 (2%) 1 (<1%) 2 (1%) 6 (4%) 0 (0%) Fatigue 0 (0%) 1 (<1%) 1 (<1%) 3 (2%) 3 (2%) 1 (<1%) Somnolence 2 (1%) 2 (2%) 0 (0%) 3 (2%) 2 (1%) 0 (0%) Long-Term (12 Month) Safety Trial In the 12 month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial, 862 patients 12 years of age and older with perennial allergic and/or nonallergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% with sweetener two sprays per nostril twice daily or azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener two sprays per nostril twice daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache, bitter taste, epistaxis, and nasopharyngitis and were generally similar between treatment groups. Focused nasal examinations were performed and showed that the incidence of nasal mucosal ulceration in each treatment group was approximately 1% at baseline and approximately 1.5% throughout the 12 month treatment period. In each treatment group, 5-7% of patients had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of nasal septal perforation or severe epistaxis. Twenty-two patients (5%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% with sweetener and 17 patients (4%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. Azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% The safety data described below reflect exposure to azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% in 1858 patients (12 years of age and older) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis from 8 clinical trials of 2 weeks to 12 months duration. In 7 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 weeks duration, 1544 patients (560 males and 984 females) with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% two sprays per nostril once or twice daily. In the 12 month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 466 patients (156 males and 310 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% two sprays per nostril twice daily. Of these 466 patients, 152 had participated in the 4-week placebo-controlled perennial allergic rhinitis clinical trials. The racial distribution for the 8 clinical trials was 80% white, 13% black, 2% Asian, and 5% other. Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older In the 7 placebo controlled clinical trials of 2 to 4 week duration, 2343 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and 540 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with two sprays per nostril of either azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% or placebo once or twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were more common in the azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% treatment groups (16-31%) than in the placebo groups (11-24%). Overall, less than 2% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions and withdrawal due to adverse reactions was similar among the treatment groups. Table 2 contains adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than or equal to 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% in the seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis controlled clinical trials. Table 2. Adverse Reactions with ≥2% Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Trials of 2 to 4 Weeks’ Duration with Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray), 0.15% in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis 2 sprays twice daily 2 sprays once daily Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray), 0.15% (N=523) Vehicle Placebo (N=523) Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Solution (Nasal Spray), 0.15% (N=1021) Vehicle Placebo (N=816) Bitter Taste 31 (6%) 5 (1%) 38 (4%) 2 (<1%) Nasal Discomfort 18 (3%) 12 (2%) 37 (4%) 7 (1%) Epistaxis 5 (1%) 7 (1%) 21 (2%) 14 (2%) Sneezing 9 (2%) 1 (<1%) 14 (1%) 0 (0%) In the above trials, somnolence was reported in <1% of patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% (11 of 1544) or vehicle placebo (1 of 1339). Long-Term (12 Month) Safety Trial In the 12 month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial, 466 patients (12 years of age and older) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% two sprays per nostril twice daily and 237 patients were treated with mometasone nasal spray two sprays per nostril once daily. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>5%) with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% were bitter taste, headache, sinusitis, and epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. In each treatment group, approximately 3% of patients had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Fifty-four patients (12%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.15% and 17 patients (7%) treated with mometasone nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. Pediatric use information for patients ages 6 to 11 years of age for treatment of allergic rhinitis, including seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis is approved for Meda Pharmaceuticals’ azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray product. However, due to Meda Pharmaceuticals’ marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience During the post approval use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray), 0.1% and 0.15%, the following adverse reactions have been identified. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include: abdominal pain, nasal burning, nausea, sweet taste, and throat irritation. Additionally, the following adverse reactions have been identified during the post approval use of azelastine hydrochloride nasal solution (nasal spray) without sweetener, 0.1% (total daily dose 0.55 mg to 1.1 mg). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported include the following: anaphylactoid reaction, application site irritation, atrial fibrillation, blurred vision, chest pain, confusion, dizziness, dyspnea, facial edema, hypertension, involuntary muscle contractions, nervousness, palpitations, paresthesia, parosmia, paroxysmal sneezing, pruritus, rash, disturbance or loss of sense of smell and/or taste, tachycardia, tolerance, urinary retention, and xerophthalmia."
