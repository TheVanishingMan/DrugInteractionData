Epistaxis reported by 5.4% of ipratropium bromide patients and 1.4% of vehicle patients, blood-tinged nasal mucus by 2.8% of ipratropium bromide patients and 0.9% of vehicle patients. Ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) was well tolerated by most patients. The most frequently reported adverse events were transient episodes of nasal dryness or epistaxis. The majority of these adverse events (96%) were mild or moderate in nature, none was considered serious, and none resulted in hospitalization. No patient required treatment for nasal dryness, and only three patients (<1%) required treatment for epistaxis, which consisted of local application of pressure or a moisturizing agent (e.g., petroleum jelly). No patient receiving ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) was discontinued from the trial due to either nasal dryness or bleeding. Adverse events reported by less than 1% of the patients receiving ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) during the controlled clinical trials that are potentially related to ipratropium bromide’s local effects or systemic anticholinergic effects include: taste perversion, nasal burning, conjunctivitis, coughing, dizziness, hoarseness, palpitation, pharyngitis, tachycardia, thirst, tinnitus and blurred vision. No controlled trial was conducted to address the relative incidence of adverse events for three times daily versus four times daily therapy. Nasal adverse events seen in the clinical trial with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients (see Table 2) were similar to those seen in the common cold trials. Additional events were reported at a higher rate in the SAR trial due in part to the longer duration of the trial and the inclusion of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URI) as an adverse event. In common cold trials, URI was the disease under study and not an adverse event.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reaction information on ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) in patients with perennial rhinitis was derived from four multicenter, vehicle-controlled clinical trials involving 703 patients (356 patients on ipratropium bromide and 347 patients on vehicle), and a one-year, open-label, follow-up trial. In three of the trials, patients received ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) three times daily, for eight weeks. In the other trial, ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) was given to patients two times daily for four weeks. Of the 285 patients who entered the open-label, follow-up trial, 232 were treated for 3 months, 200 for 6 months, and 159 up to one year. The majority (>86%) of patients treated for one year were maintained on 42 mcg per nostril, two or three times daily of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray). Table 1 shows adverse events, and the frequency that these adverse events led to the discontinuation of treatment, reported for patients who received ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) at the recommended dose of 42 mcg per nostril, or vehicle two or three times daily for four or eight weeks.

Ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) was well tolerated by most patients. The most frequently reported nasal adverse events were transient episodes of nasal dryness or epistaxis. These adverse events were mild or moderate in nature, none was considered serious, none resulted in hospitalization and most resolved spontaneously or following a dose reduction. Treatment for nasal dryness and epistaxis was required infrequently (2% or less) and consisted of local application of pressure or a moisturizing agent (e.g., petroleum jelly or saline nasal spray). Patient discontinuation for epistaxis or nasal dryness was infrequent in both the controlled (0.3% or less) and one-year, open-label (2% or less) trials. There was no evidence of nasal rebound (i.e., a clinically significant increase in rhinorrhea, posterior nasal drip, sneezing or nasal congestion severity compared to baseline) upon discontinuation of double-blind therapy in these trials. Adverse events reported by less than 2% of the patients receiving ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) during the controlled clinical trials or during the open-label follow-up trial, which are potentially related to ipratropium bromide’s local effects or systemic anticholinergic effects include: dry mouth/throat, dizziness, ocular irritation, blurred vision, conjunctivitis, hoarseness, cough, and taste perversion. There were infrequent reports of skin rash in both the controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies."

OverdosageAcute overdosage by intranasal administration is unlikely since ipratropium bromide is not well absorbed systemically after intranasal or oral administration. Following administration of a 20 mg oral dose (equivalent to ingesting more than two bottles of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% [Nasal Spray]) to 10 male volunteers, no change in heart rate or blood pressure was noted. Following a 2 mg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to the same 10 male volunteers, plasma ipratropium concentrations of 22-45 ng/mL were observed (greater than 100 times the concentrations observed following intranasal administration). Following intravenous infusion these 10 volunteers had a mean increase of heart rate of 50 bpm and less than 20 mmHg change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure at the time of peak ipratropium levels. Oral median lethal doses of ipratropium bromide were greater than: 1,000 mg/kg in mice (approximately 6,000 and 3,800 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis), 1,700 mg/kg in rats (approximately 21,000 and 13,000 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis) and 400 mg/kg in dogs (approximately 16,000 and 10,000 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis)."

The most frequently reported adverse events were transient episodes of nasal dryness or epistaxis. The majority of these adverse events (96%) were mild or moderate in nature, none was considered serious, and none resulted in hospitalization. No patient required treatment for nasal dryness, and only three patients (<1%) required treatment for epistaxis, which consisted of local application of pressure or a moisturizing agent (e.g., petroleum jelly). No patient receiving ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) was discontinued from the trial due to either nasal dryness or bleeding. Adverse events reported by less than 1% of the patients receiving ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.06% (Nasal Spray) during the controlled clinical trials that are potentially related to ipratropium bromide’s local effects or systemic anticholinergic effects include: taste perversion, nasal burning, conjunctivitis, coughing, dizziness, hoarseness, palpitation, pharyngitis, tachycardia, thirst, tinnitus and blurred vision. No controlled trial was conducted to address the relative incidence of adverse events for three times daily versus four times daily therapy. Nasal adverse events seen in the clinical trial with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients (see Table 2) were similar to those seen in the common cold trials. Additional events were reported at a higher rate in the SAR trial due in part to the longer duration of the trial and the inclusion of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URI) as an adverse event. In common cold trials, URI was the disease under study and not an adverse event.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reaction information on ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) in patients with perennial rhinitis was derived from four multicenter, vehicle-controlled clinical trials involving 703 patients (356 patients on ipratropium bromide and 347 patients on vehicle), and a one-year, open-label, follow-up trial. In three of the trials, patients received ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) three times daily, for eight weeks. In the other trial, ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) was given to patients two times daily for four weeks. Of the 285 patients who entered the open-label, follow-up trial, 232 were treated for 3 months, 200 for 6 months, and 159 up to one year. The majority (>86%) of patients treated for one year were maintained on 42 mcg per nostril, two or three times daily of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray). The following table shows adverse events, and the frequency that these adverse events led to the discontinuation of treatment, reported for patients who received ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) at the recommended dose of 42 mcg per nostril, or vehicle two or three times daily for four or eight weeks. Only adverse events reported with the incidence of at least 2.0% in the ipratropium bromide group and higher in the ipratropium bromide group than in the vehicle group are shown. % Of Patients Reporting Events+ Ipratropium Bromide Nasal Solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) (n=356) Vehicle Control (n= 347) Incidence % Discontinued % Incidence % Discontinued % Headache 9.8 0.6 9.2 0.0 Upper respiratory tract infection 9.8 1.4 7.2 1.4 Epistaxis 1 9.0 0.3 4.6 0.3 Rhinitis* Nasal dryness 5.1 0.0 0.9 0.3 Nasal irritation 2 2.0 0.0 1.7 0.6 Other nasal symptoms 3 3.1 1.1 1.7 0.3 Pharyngitis 8.1 0.3 4.6 0.0 Nausea 2.2 0.3 0.9 0.0 +This table includes adverse events which occurred at an incidence rate of at least 2.0% in the ipratropium bromide group and more frequently in the ipratropium bromide group than in the vehicle group. 1 Epistaxis reported by 7.0% of ipratropium bromide patients and 2.3% of vehicle patients, blood-tinged mucus by 2.0% of ipratropium bromide patients and 2.3% of vehicle patients. 2 Nasal irritation includes reports of nasal itching, nasal burning, nasal irritation, and ulcerative rhinitis. 3 Other nasal symptoms include reports of nasal congestion, increased rhinorrhea, increased rhinitis, posterior nasal drip, sneezing, nasal polyps, and nasal edema. * All events are listed by their WHO term; rhinitis has been presented by descriptive terms for clarification. Ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) was well tolerated by most patients. The most frequently reported nasal adverse events were transient episodes of nasal dryness or epistaxis. These adverse events were mild or moderate in nature, none was considered serious, none resulted in hospitalization and most resolved spontaneously or following a dose reduction. Treatment for nasal dryness and epistaxis was required infrequently (2% or less) and consisted of local application of pressure or a moisturizing agent (e.g., petroleum jelly or saline nasal spray). Patient discontinuation for epistaxis or nasal dryness was infrequent in both the controlled (0.3% or less) and one-year, open-label (2% or less) trials. There was no evidence of nasal rebound (i.e., a clinically significant increase in rhinorrhea, posterior nasal drip, sneezing or nasal congestion severity compared to baseline) upon discontinuation of double-blind therapy in these trials. Adverse events reported by less than 2% of the patients receiving ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) during the controlled clinical trials or during the open-label follow-up trial, which are potentially related to ipratropium bromide’s local effects or systemic anticholinergic effects include: dry mouth/throat, dizziness, ocular irritation, blurred vision, conjunctivitis, hoarseness, cough, and taste perversion. There were infrequent reports of skin rash in both the controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies. Post-Marketing ExperienceAllergic-type reactions such as skin rash angioedema of the throat, tongue, lips and face, generalized urticaria (including giant urticaria), laryngospasm, and anaphylactic reactions have been reported with ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% (Nasal Spray) and for other ipratropium bromide-containing products, with positive rechallenge in some cases. Additional side effects identified from the published literature and/or post-marketing surveillance on the use of ipratropium bromide-containing products (singly or in combination with albuterol), include: urinary retention, prostatic disorders, mydriasis, cases of precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma, acute eye pain, wheezing, dryness of the oropharynx, sinusitis, tachycardia, palpitations, pain, edema, gastrointestinal distress (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), bowel obstruction, and constipation. After oral inhalation of ipratropium bromide in patients suffering from COPD/Asthma supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation have been reported. OverdosageAcute overdosage by intranasal administration is unlikely since ipratropium bromide is not well absorbed systemically after intranasal or oral administration. Following administration of a 20 mg oral dose (equivalent to ingesting more than four bottles of ipratropium bromide nasal solution 0.03% [Nasal Spray]) to 10 male volunteers, no change in heart rate or blood pressure was noted. Following a 2 mg intravenous infusion over 15 minutes to the same 10 male volunteers, plasma ipratropium concentrations of 22-45 ng/mL were observed (>100 times the concentrations observed following intranasal administration). Following intravenous infusion these 10 volunteers had a mean increase of heart rate of 50 bpm and less than 20 mmHg change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure at the time of peak ipratropium levels. Oral median lethal doses of ipratropium bromide were greater than 1,000 mg/kg in mice (approximately 16,000 and 9,500 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis), 1,700 mg/kg in rats (approximately 55,000 and 32,000 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis), and 400 mg/kg in dogs (approximately 43,000 and 25,000 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults and children, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS COMBIVENT RESPIMAT has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including beta-adrenergic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids, commonly used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are no formal studies fully evaluating the interaction effects of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and these drugs with respect to safety and effectiveness. Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administration of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT with other anticholinergic-containing drugs (7.1) Beta-adrenergic agonists: May increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects. Avoid coadministration of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and other sympathomimetic agents (7.2) Beta-blockers: Inhibit the effect of albuterol. Consider alternative therapy in patients with hyperreactive airways (7.3) Diuretics: Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with diuretics may worsen with concomitant use of beta-agonists. Consider monitoring potassium levels. (7.4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOs) or tricyclic antidepressants: May potentiate effect of albuterol on the vascular system. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAOs or tricyclic antidepressants. (7.5) 7.1 Anticholinergic Agents There is the potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Therefore, avoid coadministration of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4) ]. 7.2 Beta-adrenergic Agonists Caution is advised in the coadministration of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and other sympathomimetic agents due to the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5) ]. 7.3 Beta-receptor Blocking Agents Beta-receptor blocking agents and albuterol inhibit the effect of each other. Beta-receptor blocking agents should be used with caution in patients with hyperreactive airways. 7.4 Diuretics The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia which may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta2-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta2-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonist-containing drugs, such as COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, with non-potassium sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels. 7.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents because the action of albuterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAOs or tricyclic antidepressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Use of albuterol, a beta2-adrenergic agonist, may be associated with the following: Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Cardiovascular effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Albuterol is a component of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. Use of ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic, may result in the following: Ocular effects [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Urinary retention [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Ipratropium bromide is a component of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. Most common (≥2%) adverse reactions for COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) are upper respiratory infection, nasopharyngitis, cough, bronchitis, headache, and dyspnea (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience COMBIVENT RESPIMAT 12-Week Clinical Trials The safety data described in Table 1 below are derived from one 12-week, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial that compared COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg), CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg), and ipratropium bromide delivered by the RESPIMAT inhaler (20 mcg) administered four times a day in 1460 adult COPD patients (955 males and 505 females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 486 were treated with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. The COMBIVENT RESPIMAT group was composed of mostly Caucasian (88.5%) patients with a mean age of 63.8 years, and a mean percent predicted FEV1 at screening of 41.5%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction were excluded from the trial. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Table 1 shows all adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of ≥2% in the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT treatment group in the 12-week COPD trial. The frequency of the corresponding adverse reactions in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol and ipratropium bromide delivered by the RESPIMAT inhaler groups is included for comparison. The rates are derived from all reported adverse reactions of that type not present at baseline, whether considered drug-related or not by the clinical investigator. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in ≥2% of Patients in the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT Group in a 12-Week COPD Clinical Trial Body System (Event) 12-Week Ipratropium-Controlled Trial COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg) Ipratropium bromide by the RESPIMAT Inhaler (20 mcg) [n=486] [n=491] [n=483] Patients with any adverse reaction 46 52 45 Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Cough Dyspnea 3 2 2 2 2 3 Nervous system disorders Headache 3 2 3 Infections and infestations Bronchitis Nasopharyngitis Upper Respiratory infection 3 4 3 3 3 4 1 4 3 Adverse reactions that occurred in <2% in the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) group observed in this 12-week trial include: Vascular disorders: hypertension; Nervous system disorders: dizziness and tremor; Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder: muscle spasms and myalgia; Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, and vomiting; General disorders and administration site conditions: asthenia, influenza-like illness, and chest discomfort; Eye disorders: eye pain; Metabolism and nutritional disorders: hypokalemia; Cardiac disorders: palpitations and tachycardia; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pruritus and rash; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders ; pharyngolaryngeal pain and wheezing. A separate 12-week trial evaluated a higher than approved dose of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT in 1118 COPD patients. Patients were randomized to COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (40/200 mcg) (n=345), CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg) (n=180), ipratropium delivered by the RESPIMAT (40 mcg) (n=252) or placebo (n=341). The overall incidence and nature of adverse reactions observed were similar to the adverse reactions seen with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT 20/100 mcg. COMBIVENT RESPIMAT Long Term (48-week) Safety Trial Long term chronic use safety data for COMBIVENT RESPIMAT were obtained from one 48-week, randomized, multi-center, open-label, parallel-group trial that compared COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg), CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg) and the free combination of ipratropium bromide (34 mcg) and albuterol (180 mcg) HFA inhalation aerosols administered 4 times a day in 465 adult COPD patients (273 males and 192 females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 157 were treated with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. The COMBIVENT RESPIMAT group was composed of mostly Caucasian (93.5%) patients with a mean age of 62.9 years, and a mean percent predicted FEV1 at screening of 47.0%. An evaluation of the safety data from the trial revealed that most adverse reactions were similar in type and rate between treatment groups. However, cough occurred more frequently in patients enrolled in the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT group (7.0%) compared to those in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (2.6%) or the free combination of ipratropium bromide and albuterol HFA inhalation aerosols (3.9%) groups. In addition to the adverse reactions reported in the controlled clinical trial with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, adverse reaction information concerning CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol is derived from two 12-week controlled clinical trials (N=358 for CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol). Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol treatment group include: bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dyspnea, cough, pain, respiratory disorder, sinusitis, pharyngitis and nausea. Adverse reactions reported in <2% of patients in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol treatment group include: edema, fatigue, hypertension, dizziness, nervousness, tremor, dysphonia, insomnia, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, vomiting, arrhythmia, palpitation, tachycardia, arthralgia, angina, increased sputum, taste perversion, urinary tract infection, dysuria, dry throat and bronchospasm. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol. Since CFC-propelled Combivent Inhalation Aerosol and Combivent Respimat contain the same active ingredients, one should take into account the fact that the adverse reactions seen with CFC-propelled Combivent Inhalation Aerosol could also occur with Combivent Respimat. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: glaucoma, blurred vision, mydriasis, conjunctival hyperemia, halo vision, accommodation disorder, ocular irritation and corneal edema Gastrointestinal disorders : gastrointestinal motility disorder, drying of secretions, stomatitis and mouth edema Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity; Investigations: intraocular pressure increased, blood pressure diastolic decreased and blood pressure systolic increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : muscular weakness Psychiatric disorders: CNS stimulation, mental disorder Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: throat irritation, paradoxical bronchospasm, wheezing, nasal congestion and pharyngeal edema Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : angioedema, hyperhidrosis, and skin reaction Urinary disorders: urinary retention Cardiac disorders: myocardial ischemia Allergic-type reactions such as skin reactions including rash, pruritus, and urticaria (including giant urticaria), angioedema including that of tongue, lips and face, laryngospasm, and anaphylactic reaction have also been reported with CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol, with positive re-challenge in some cases [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. In a 5-year placebo-controlled trial, hospitalizations for supraventricular tachycardia and/or atrial fibrillation occurred with an incidence rate of 0.5% in COPD patients receiving CFC-propelled Atrovent® (ipratropium bromide) Inhalation Aerosol. Metabolic acidosis has been reported with use of albuterol-containing products."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue COMBIVENT RESPIMAT immediately and treat with alternative therapy if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs (5.1) Patients with cardiovascular system disorders: Use with caution because of beta-adrenergic stimulation (5.2) Ocular effects: Advise patients to avoid spraying into eyes and to contact a physician if blurred vision, halos, or other visual disturbances occur. Monitor patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.3) Urinary retention: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction (5.4) Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis: Discontinue COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and institute alternative therapy if immediate hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or oropharyngeal edema occur (5.6) Coexisting conditions: Use with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus (5.7) 5.1 Paradoxical Bronchospasm COMBIVENT RESPIMAT can produce paradoxical bronchospasm that can be life-threatening. If it occurs, therapy with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. 5.2 Cardiovascular Effect The albuterol sulfate contained in COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, like other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If these symptoms occur, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. There is some evidence from post-marketing data and published literature of rare occurrences of myocardial ischemia associated with albuterol. In addition, beta-adrenergic agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. Therefore, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders; especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.3 Ocular Effects Ipratropium bromide, a component of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, is an anticholinergic and may increase intraocular pressure. This may result in precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma. Therefore, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Patients should avoid spraying COMBIVENT RESPIMAT into the eyes. If a patient sprays COMBIVENT RESPIMAT into their eyes they may cause acute eye pain or discomfort, temporary blurring of vision, mydriasis, visual halos, or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival or corneal congestion. Advise patients to consult their physician immediately if any of these symptoms develop while using COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. 5.4 Urinary Retention Ipratropium bromide, a component of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, is an anticholinergic and may cause urinary retention. Therefore, caution is advised when administering this medication to patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.5 Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma. The exact cause of death is unknown, but cardiac arrest following an unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and subsequent hypoxia is suspected [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema may occur after administration of ipratropium bromide or albuterol sulfate. In clinical trials and post-marketing experience with ipratropium containing products, hypersensitivity reactions such as skin rash, pruritus, angioedema of tongue, lips and face, urticaria (including giant urticaria), laryngospasm and anaphylactic reactions have been reported [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2) ]. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatment should be considered [ see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.7 Coexisting Conditions COMBIVENT RESPIMAT contains albuterol sulfate, a beta2-adrenergic sympathomimetic amine and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. 5.8 Hypokalemia Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients (possibly through intracellular shunting) which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reaction information on ATROVENT Nasal Spray 0.03% in patients with perennial rhinitis was derived from four multicenter, vehicle-controlled clinical trials involving 703 patients (356 patients on ATROVENT and 347 patients on vehicle), and a one-year, open-label, follow-up trial. In three of the trials, patients received ATROVENT Nasal Spray 0.03% three times daily, for eight weeks. In the other trial, ATROVENT Nasal Spray 0.03% was given to patients two times daily for four weeks. Of the 285 patients who entered the open-label, follow-up trial, 232 were treated for 3 months, 200 for 6 months, and 159 up to one year. The majority (>86%) of patients treated for one year were maintained on 42 mcg per nostril, two or three times daily, of ATROVENT Nasal Spray 0.03%. Table 1 shows adverse events, and the frequency that these adverse events led to the discontinuation of treatment, reported for patients who received ATROVENT Nasal Spray 0.03% at the recommended dose of 42 mcg per nostril, or vehicle two or three times daily for four or eight weeks.

The most frequently reported nasal adverse events were transient episodes of nasal dryness or epistaxis. These adverse events were mild or moderate in nature, none was considered serious, none resulted in hospitalization and most resolved spontaneously or following a dose reduction. Treatment for nasal dryness and epistaxis was required infrequently (2% or less) and consisted of local application of pressure or a moisturizing agent (e.g., petroleum jelly or saline nasal spray). Patient discontinuation for epistaxis or nasal dryness was infrequent in both the controlled (0.3% or less) and one-year, open-label (2% or less) trials. There was no evidence of nasal rebound (i.e., a clinically significant increase in rhinorrhea, posterior nasal drip, sneezing or nasal congestion severity compared to baseline) upon discontinuation of double-blind therapy in these trials. Adverse events reported by less than 2% of the patients receiving ATROVENT Nasal Spray 0.03% during the controlled clinical trials or during the open-label follow-up trial, which are potentially related to ATROVENT’s local effects or systemic anticholinergic effects include: dry mouth/throat, dizziness, ocular irritation, blurred vision, conjunctivitis, hoarseness, cough, and taste perversion. There were infrequent reports of skin rash in both the controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies.
