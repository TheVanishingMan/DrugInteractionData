Cardiovascular: Tachycardia. Digestive: Paralytic ileus, constipation, vomiting, nausea, dry mouth.

Nervous System: Toxic psychosis, including confusion, disorientation, memory impairment, visual hallucinations; exacerbation of pre-existing psychotic symptoms; nervousness; depression; listlessness; numbness of fingers. Special Senses: Blurred vision, dilated pupils. Urogenital: Urinary retention, dysuria. Metabolic/Immune or Skin: Occasionally, an allergic reaction, e.g., skin rash, develops.
