        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment (5.1). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds (5.2). Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) (5.3). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds (5.4). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage (10)]. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diueretics with paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diueretics with Zemplar may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during Zemplar treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when Zemplar Capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, Zemplar Capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with Zemplar, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia: The risk may be increased when Paricalcitol Injection is used concomitantly with high dose calcium preparations, thiazide diuretics, or metabolically inactive or active forms of vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium when using Paricalcitol Injection and adjust dose accordingly. (5.1) Digitalis Toxicity: Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using Paricalcitol Injection concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection. (5.2) Risk of Increased Paricalcitol Levels With Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Use of Paricalcitol Injection with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases the concentration of paricalcitol in the blood. In patients on Paricalcitol Injection who are initiating or discontinuing drugs known to be strong CYP3A inhibitors, monitor serum calcium and PTH more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required. (5.3) Adynamic Bone Disease: May develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor PTH levels and adjust Paricalcitol Injection accordingly. (5.4) 5.1 Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia may occur during Paricalcitol Injection treatment and may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium containing preparations, thiazide diuretics, or vitamin D (i.e., all forms). Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Hypercalcemia may be so severe as to require emergency attention. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Prevention of such adverse reactions requires frequent serum calcium monitoring and careful Paricalcitol Injection dose adjustments. Concomitant use with other active vitamin D analogues should be avoided during Paricalcitol Injection treatment to prevent hypercalcemia. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Hypercalcemia of any cause increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using Paricalcitol Injection concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. 5.3 Risk of Increased Paricalcitol Levels With Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use of Paricalcitol Injection with strong CYP3A inhibitors will increase the levels of paricalcitol in the blood. In patients on Paricalcitol Injection who are initiating or discontinuing therapy with drugs known to be strong CYP3A inhibitors, monitor serum calcium and PTH more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. 5.4 Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease with subsequent increased risk of fractures may develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor PTH levels and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose [see Dosage and Administration (2)]."

In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

        "Drug Interactions Specific interaction studies were not performed with Zemplar Injection. Paricalcitol is not expected to inhibit the clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A nor induce the clearance of drug metabolized by CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. A multiple dose drug-drug interaction study with ketoconazole and paricalcitol capsule demonstrated that ketoconazole approximately doubled paricalcitol AUC0-∞ (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Since paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A and ketoconazole is known to be a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A enzyme, care should be taken while paricalcitol is co-administered with ketoconazole and other strong P450 3A inhibitors including the following drugs but not limited to: atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin or voriconazole. Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause, so caution should be applied when digitalis compounds are prescribed concomitantly with Zemplar."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including Zemplar Capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of Zemplar Capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during Zemplar treatment (5.1). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when Zemplar Capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds (5.2). Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment (5.3). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds (5.4). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage (10)]. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diueretics with Zemplar may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during Zemplar treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when Zemplar Capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with Zemplar, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment (5.1). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds (5.2). Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR(eGFR) (5.3). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds (5.4). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. . Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification.Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diueretics with Zemplar may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity TAluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Hypercalcemia: The risk may be increased when Paricalcitol Injection is used concomitantly with high dose calcium preparations, thiazide diuretics, or metabolically inactive or active forms of vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium when using Paricalcitol Injection and adjust dose accordingly. (5.1) - Digitalis Toxicity: Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using Paricalcitol Injection concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection. (5.2) - Risk of Increased Paricalcitol Levels With Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Use of Paricalcitol Injection with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases the concentration of paricalcitol in the blood. In patients on Paricalcitol Injection who are initiating or discontinuing drugs known to be strong CYP3A inhibitors, monitor serum calcium and PTH more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required. (5.3) - Adynamic Bone Disease: May develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor PTH levels and adjust Paricalcitol Injection accordingly. (5.4) 5.1 Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia may occur during Paricalcitol Injection treatment and may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium containing preparations, thiazide diuretics, or vitamin D (i.e., all forms). Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Hypercalcemia may be so severe as to require emergency attention. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Prevention of such adverse reactions requires frequent serum calcium monitoring and careful Paricalcitol Injection dose adjustments. Concomitant use with other active vitamin D analogues should be avoided during Paricalcitol Injection treatment to prevent hypercalcemia. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Hypercalcemia of any cause increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using Paricalcitol Injection concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 5.3 Risk of Increased Paricalcitol Levels With Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use of Paricalcitol Injection with strong CYP3A inhibitors will increase the levels of paricalcitol in the blood. In patients on Paricalcitol Injection who are initiating or discontinuing therapy with drugs known to be strong CYP3A inhibitors, monitor serum calcium and PTH more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease with subsequent increased risk of fractures may develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor PTH levels and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose [see Dosage and Administration (2) ].",

The proportion of patients who terminated prematurely from the study due to adverse events was 7% for paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 7% for placebo patients. Adverse events occurring in the paricalcitol capsules group at a frequency of 2% or greater and more frequently than in the placebo group are as follows: Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Body System Occurring in >= 2% of Subjects in the Paricalcitol-Treated Group, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3, CKD Stage 5 Study; All Treated Patients Number (%) of Subjects Adverse Events Includes only events more common in the paricalcitol treatment group.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. -Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment (5.1). -Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds (5.2). -Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) (5.3). -Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds (5.4). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage (10)]. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diueretics with paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."
