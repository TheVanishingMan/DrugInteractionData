        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that Increase Gastric pH: Administer PROCYSBI at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after medications containing bicarbonate or carbonate. (2.4, 7.1) 7.1 Drugs that Increase Gastric pH Drugs that increase the gastric pH (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, medications containing bicarbonate or carbonate) may alter the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine due to the premature release of cysteamine from PROCYSBI and increase WBC cystine concentration. Concomitant administration of 20 mg omeprazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine when PROCYSBI was administered with 240 mL of orange juice [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effect of omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine was not studied after PROCYSBI administration with water. Monitor WBC cystine concentration when drugs that increase the gastric pH are concomitantly used [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 7.2 Use with Alcohol Consumption of alcohol with PROCYSBI may increase the rate of cysteamine release and/or adversely alter the pharmacokinetic properties, as well as the effectiveness and safety of PROCYSBI. Therefore, do not consume alcoholic beverages during treatment with PROCYSBI [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 7.3 Other Medications Used for the Management of Fanconi syndrome PROCYSBI can be administered with other electrolyte and mineral replacements necessary for management of Fanconi syndrome, as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed in other sections of the labeling: Ehlers-Danlos-like Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Skin Rash [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Gastrointestinal (GI) Ulcers and Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Central Nervous System Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Leukopenia and/or Elevated Phosphatase Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Benign Intracranial Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) are: vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, breath odor, diarrhea, skin odor, fatigue, rash, and headache. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Raptor Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-855-888-4004 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The data described below reflect exposure to cysteamine in 328 patients with nephropathic cystinosis (246 patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine as cysteamine hydrochloride or phosphocysteamine, and 63 patients receiving PROCYSBI) in open-label clinical trials. Clinical Trials Experience with PROCYSBI Sixty-two patients with cystinosis (38 males and 24 females) received PROCYSBI in two clinical trials at doses ranging from 0.29 grams/m2 per day to 2.19 grams/m2 per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. All patients were switched from immediate-release cysteamine to PROCYSBI. Forty-three patients, ages 7 to 24 years old, received PROCYSBI in an 8-week, open-label, randomized, cross-over trial comparing PROCYSBI to immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Forty of 43 patients continued PROCYSBI treatment in an open-label extension trial, and were treated with PROCYSBI for longer than 2 years. An additional 19 patients (6 transplanted patients and 13 patients aged 2 to 6 years) were enrolled directly into this trial and were treated with PROCYSBI for up to 18 months. In the open-label, randomized, cross-over trial, a higher incidence of adverse reactions was reported in patients during the PROCYSBI treatment period compared with the immediate-release cysteamine treatment period (see Table 3). Other significant adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Table 3: Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥5% of patients in the randomized, cross-over clinical trial Immediate-release cysteamine PROCYSBI Adverse Reaction (n = 41) % (n = 43) % Vomiting/emesis 12 19 Nausea 7 16 Abdominal pain/discomfort 0 14 Headache 0 9 Dizziness 0 5 Anorexia/loss of appetite 5 2 For all patients treated with PROCYSBI in both trials (N=62), the most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5%) were vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, breath odor, diarrhea, skin odor, fatigue, rash, and headache. Clinical Trials Experience with Immediate-Release Cysteamine The most frequent adverse reactions involved the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems and were especially prominent at the initiation of cysteamine therapy. Most patients were able to resume therapy at lower doses. The most common reactions (>5%) were vomiting, anorexia, fever, diarrhea, lethargy, and rash. Other adverse reactions included nausea, bad breath, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and urticaria. Withdrawals due to intolerance, vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and fever occurred more frequently in those patients receiving 1.95 grams/m2 per day as compared with 1.3 grams/m2 per day of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Musculoskeletal: Joint hyperextension, leg pain, osteopenia, compression fracture, scoliosis, genu valgum [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Skin: Erythema multiforme bullosa, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome, molluscoid pseudotumors, skin striae, skin fragility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Central Nervous System: seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression.and encephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)], benign intracranial hypertension (or PTC) and/or papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ehlers-Danlos-like Syndrome: Reduce dosage if skin and bone lesions occur. (5.1) Skin Rash: Discontinue if severe skin rash such as erythema multiforme bullosa or toxic epidermal necrolysis occurs. (5.2) Gastrointestinal (GI) Ulcers and Bleeding: Monitor for GI symptoms and consider decreasing the dose if severe symptoms occur. (5.3) Central Nervous System (CNS) Symptoms: Monitor for CNS symptoms; interrupt or reduce the dose for severe symptoms or those that persist or progress (5.4). Leukopenia and/or Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels: Monitor white blood cell count and alkaline phosphatase levels; decrease or discontinue the dose until values revert to normal. (5.5) Benign Intracranial Hypertension: Monitor for signs and symptoms; interrupt or reduce the dose for signs/symptoms that persist, or discontinue if diagnosis is confirmed. (5.6) 5.1 Ehlers-Danlos-like Syndrome Skin and bone lesions that resemble clinical findings for Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome have been reported in patients treated with high doses of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate or other cysteamine salts. These include molluscoid pseudotumors (purplish hemorrhagic lesions), skin striae, bone lesions (including osteopenia, compression fractures, scoliosis and genu valgum), leg pain, and joint hyperextension. One patient on immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate with serious skin lesions subsequently died of acute cerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy. Monitor patients for development of skin or bone lesions and interrupt PROCYSBI dosing if patients develop these lesions. PROCYSBI may be restarted at a lower dose under close supervision, then slowly increase to the appropriate therapeutic dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Skin Rash Severe skin rashes such as erythema multiforme bullosa or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. If severe skin rashes develop, permanently discontinue use of PROCYSBI [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Ulcers and Bleeding Gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration and bleeding have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. GI tract symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain, sometimes severe, have been associated with cysteamine. If severe GI tract symptoms develop, consider decreasing the dose of PROCYSBI [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.4 Central Nervous System Symptoms Central Nervous System (CNS) symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy have been associated with immediate-release cysteamine. Neurological complications have also been described in some patients with cystinosis who have not been treated with cysteamine. Carefully evaluate and monitor patients who develop CNS symptoms. Interrupt medication or adjust the dose as necessary for patients with severe symptoms or with symptoms that persist or progress. Inform patients that PROCYSBI may impair their ability to perform tasks such as driving or operating machinery. 5.5 Leukopenia and/or Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels Cysteamine has been associated with reversible leukopenia and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Monitor white blood cell counts and alkaline phosphatase levels. If tests values remain elevated, consider decreasing the dose or discontinuing the drug until values revert to normal. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri; PTC) and/or papilledema have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of PTC, including headache, tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, diplopia, blurry vision, loss of vision, pain behind the eye or pain with eye movement. If signs/symptoms persist, interrupt dosing or decrease the dose and refer the patient to an ophthalmologist. If the diagnosis is confirmed, permanently discontinue use of PROCYSBI."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In three clinical trials, cysteamine or phosphocysteamine have been administered to 246 children with cystinosis. Causality of side effects is sometimes difficult to determine because adverse effects may result from the underlying disease. The most frequent adverse reactions seen involve the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. These are especially prominent at the initiation of cysteamine therapy. Temporarily suspending treatment, then gradual re-introduction may be effective in improving tolerance. Adverse reactions were not collected systematically in the NCCS, but were often listed by investigators. The following rates may therefore be underestimated. The most common events (> 5%) were vomiting 35%, anorexia 31%, fever 22%, diarrhea 16%, lethargy 11%, and rash 7%. Less common adverse events are: Body as a whole: Dehydration. Cardiovascular: Hypertension. Digestive: Nausea, bad breath, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, gastroenteritis, duodenitis, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Central Nervous System: Somnolence, encephalopathy, headache, seizures, ataxia, confusion, tremor, hyperkinesia, decreasing hearing, dizziness, jitteriness. Psychiatric: Nervousness, abnormal thinking, depression, emotional lability, hallucinations, nightmares. Integumentary: Urticaria. Urogenital: Interstitial nephritis, renal failure (see WARNINGS). Clinical Laboratory: Abnormal liver function, anemia, leukopenia. Adverse reactions or intolerance leading to cessation of treatment occurred in 8% of patients in the U.S. Studies. Withdrawals due to intolerance, vomiting associated with medication, anorexia, lethargy, and fever appeared dose related, occurring more frequently in those patients receiving 1.95 grams/m2/day as compared to 1.30 grams/m2/day.
