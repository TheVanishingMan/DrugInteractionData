        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fluticasone furoate is cleared by extensive first-pass metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. In a drug interaction study of intranasal fluticasone furoate and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole given as a 200-mg once-daily dose for 7 days, 6 of 20 subjects receiving fluticasone furoate and ketoconazole had measurable but low levels of fluticasone furoate compared with 1 of 20 receiving fluticasone furoate and placebo. Based on this study and the low systemic exposure, there was a 5% reduction in 24-hour serum cortisol levels with ketoconazole compared with placebo. The data from this study should be carefully interpreted because the study was conducted with ketoconazole 200 mg once daily rather than 400 mg, which is the maximum recommended dosage. Therefore, caution is required with the coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray and ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Based on data with another glucocorticoid, fluticasone propionate, metabolized by CYP3A4, coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of systemic effects secondary to increased exposure to fluticasone furoate. High exposure to corticosteroids increases the potential for systemic side effects, such as cortisol suppression. Enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that fluticasone furoate is unlikely to significantly alter the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of other compounds at clinically relevant intranasal dosages. Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) may increase exposure to fluticasone furoate. Coadministration of ritonavir is not recommended. (5.6, 7) Use caution with coadministration of other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. (5.6, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following: Epistaxis, ulcerations, Candida albicans infection, impaired wound healing, and nasal septal perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Cataracts and glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effects, including growth reduction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] The most common adverse reactions (>1% incidence) included headache, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, nasal ulceration, back pain, pyrexia, and cough. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The safety data described below reflect exposure to VERAMYST Nasal Spray in 1,563 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in 9 controlled clinical trials of 2 to 12 weeks’ duration. The data from adults and adolescents are based upon 6 clinical trials in which 768 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (473 females and 295 males aged 12 years and older) were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily for 2 to 6 weeks. The racial distribution of adult and adolescent patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was 82% white, 5% black, and 13% other. The data from pediatric patients are based upon 3 clinical trials in which 795 children with seasonal or perennial rhinitis (352 females and 443 males aged 2 to 11 years) were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 55 or 110 mcg once daily for 2 to 12 weeks. The racial distribution of pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was 75% white, 11% black, and 14% other. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults and Adolescents Aged 12 Years and Older: Overall adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray and those receiving placebo. Less than 3% of patients in clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. The rate of withdrawal among patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was similar or lower than the rate among patients receiving placebo. Table 1 displays the common adverse reactions (>1% in any patient group receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray) that occurred more frequently in patients aged 12 years and older treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray compared with placebo-treated patients. Table 1. Adverse Reactions With >1% Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 to 6 Weeks’ Duration With VERAMYST Nasal Spray in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Event Adult and Adolescent Patients Aged 12 Years and Older Vehicle Placebo (n = 774) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg Once Daily (n = 768) Headache 54 (7%) 72 (9%) Epistaxis 32 (4%) 45 (6%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 8 (1%) 15 (2%) Nasal ulceration 3 (<1%) 11 (1%) Back pain 7 (<1%) 9 (1%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to 11 Years: In the 3 clinical trials in pediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years, overall adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray and those receiving placebo. Table 2 displays the common adverse reactions (>3% in any patient group receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray), that occurred more frequently in patients aged 2 to 11 years treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray compared with placebo-treated patients. Table 2. Adverse Reactions With >3% Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 to 12 Weeks’ Duration With VERAMYST Nasal Spray in Pediatric Patients With Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Event Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to <12 Years Vehicle Placebo (n = 429) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 55 mcg Once Daily (n = 369) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg Once Daily (n = 426) Headache 31 (7%) 28 (8%) 33 (8%) Nasopharyngitis 21 (5%) 20 (5%) 21 (5%) Epistaxis 19 (4%) 17 (5%) 17 (4%) Pyrexia 7 (2%) 17 (5%) 19 (4%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 14 (3%) 16 (4%) 12 (3%) Cough 12 (3%) 12 (3%) 16 (4%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Pyrexia occurred more frequently in children aged 2 to <6 years compared with children aged 6 to <12 years. Long-Term (52-Week) Safety Trial: In a 52-week, placebo-controlled, long-term safety trial, 605 patients (307 females and 298 males aged 12 years and older) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily for 12 months and 201 were treated with placebo nasal spray. While most adverse reactions were similar in type and rate between the treatment groups, epistaxis occurred more frequently in patients who received VERAMYST Nasal Spray (123/605, 20%) than in patients who received placebo (17/201, 8%). Epistaxis tended to be more severe in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray. All 17 reports of epistaxis that occurred in patients who received placebo were of mild intensity, while 83, 39, and 1 of the total 123 epistaxis events in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray were of mild, moderate, and severe intensity, respectively. No patient experienced a nasal septal perforation during this trial. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone furoate or a combination of these factors. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria. Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: Rhinalgia, nasal discomfort (including nasal burning, nasal irritation, and nasal soreness), nasal dryness, and nasal septal perforation."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Epistaxis, nasal ulceration, Candida albicans infection, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. (5.1) Development of glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts. Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. (5.2) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria, may occur after administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. (5.3) Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. (5.4) Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue VERAMYST Nasal Spray slowly. (5.5) Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray. (5.7, 8.4) 5.1 Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis and Nasal Ulceration: In clinical studies of 2 to 52 weeks’ duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were observed more frequently and some epistaxis events were more severe in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Candida Infection: Evidence of localized infections of the nose with Candida albicans was seen on nasal exams in 7 of 2,745 patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray during clinical trials and was reported as an adverse event in 3 patients. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Therefore, patients using VERAMYST Nasal Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Nasal Septal Perforation: Postmarketing cases of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of VERAMYST Nasal Spray [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Impaired Wound Healing: Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use VERAMYST Nasal Spray until healing has occurred. 5.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation was evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in 1 controlled 12-month study in 806 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older and in 1 controlled 12-week study in 558 children aged 2 to 11 years. The patients had perennial allergic rhinitis and were treated with either VERAMYST Nasal Spray (110 mcg once daily in adult and adolescent patients and 55 or 110 mcg once daily in pediatric patients) or placebo. Intraocular pressure remained within the normal range (<21 mmHg) in ≥98% of the patients in any treatment group in both studies. However, in the 12-month study in adolescents and adults, 12 patients, all treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily, had intraocular pressure measurements that increased above normal levels (≥21 mmHg). In the same study, 7 patients (6 treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily and 1 patient treated with placebo) had cataracts identified during the study that were not present at baseline. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria, may occur after administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Discontinue VERAMYST Nasal Spray if such reactions occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox or measles develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract, untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections, systemic viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression: When intranasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of VERAMYST Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, rapid decreases in systemic corticosteroid dosages may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of systemic effects secondary to increased exposure to fluticasone furoate. Use caution with the coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray and other potent cytochrome P450 3A4(CYP3A4) inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.7 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including VERAMYST Nasal Spray, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ARNUITY ELLIPTA was evaluated in 10 double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trials (7 with placebo) of 8 to 76 weeks’ duration, which enrolled 6,219 subjects with asthma. Doses of fluticasone furoate studied ranged from 25 to 800 mcg. ARNUITY ELLIPTA 100 mcg was studied in 1,663 subjects, and ARNUITY ELLIPTA 200 mcg was studied in 608 subjects. Subject ages ranged from 12 to 84 years, 65% were female, and 75% were Caucasian. In these trials, the proportion of subjects who discontinued study treatment early due to adverse reactions was 2% for subjects treated with both ARNUITY ELLIPTA 100 mcg and ARNUITY ELLIPTA 200 mcg and less than or equal to 1% for placebo-treated subjects. Serious adverse events, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, that occurred in more than 1 subject and in a greater percentage of subjects treated with ARNUITY ELLIPTA than placebo included hypertension, abscess, breast cancer, traumatic limb amputation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intervertebral disc protrusion; all events occurred at rates less than or equal to 1%. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with ARNUITY ELLIPTA 100 mcg is shown in Table 1 and is based on one 24-week trial (Trial 1) in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma. Table 1. Adverse Reactions with ARNUITY ELLIPTA 100 mcg with Greater than or Equal to 3% Incidence and More Common than Placebo (Trial 1, Intent-to-Treat Population) Adverse Reaction ARNUITY ELLIPTA 100 mcg n = 114 % Placebo n = 115 % Nasopharyngitis 8 5 Bronchitis 7 6 Upper respiratory tract infection 6 5 Headache 6 4 Pharyngitis 4 3 Sinusitis 4 <1 Toothache 3 <1 Gastroenteritis viral 3 0 Oral candidiasis 3 0 Oropharyngeal candidiasis 3 0 Oropharyngeal pain 3 0 The incidence of adverse reactions associated with ARNUITY ELLIPTA 200 mcg is shown in Table 2 and is based on one 24-week trial (Trial 3) in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma. This trial did not have a placebo arm. Table 2.

Long-Term Safety: Long-term safety data are based on 2 trials in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma. In one 52-week trial, subjects received fluticasone furoate 100 mcg (n = 201) or fluticasone furoate 200 mcg (n = 202) in combination with a LABA. Subjects had a mean age of 39 years (adolescents made up 16% of the population), 63% were female, and 67% were Caucasian. In addition to the events shown in Table 1 and Table 2, adverse events occurring in greater than or equal to 3% of the subjects treated with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg or fluticasone furoate 200 mcg, in combination with a LABA, included pyrexia, extrasystoles, upper abdominal pain, respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and allergic rhinitis. In a second 24- to 76-week trial, subjects received fluticasone furoate 100 mcg (n = 1,010). Subjects participating in this trial had a history of one or more asthma exacerbations that required treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroids or emergency department visit or in-patient hospitalization for the treatment of asthma within the previous 12 months. Subjects had a mean age of 42 years (adolescents made up 14% of the population), 67% were female, and 73% were Caucasian. In addition to the events shown in Table 1 and Table 2, adverse events occurring in greater than or equal to 3% of subjects treated with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg for up to 76 weeks included allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, and arthralgia."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Localized infections: Candida albicans infection of the mouth and throat may occur. Monitor patients periodically. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation. (5.1) •Deterioration of asthma and acute episodes: Do not use for relief of acute symptoms. Patients require immediate re-evaluation during rapidly deteriorating asthma. (5.2) •Immunosuppression: Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral, parasitic infections or ocular herpes simplex. Use with caution in patients with these infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients. (5.3) •Transferring patients from systemic corticosteroids: Risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from systemic corticosteroids. Wean patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to ARNUITY ELLIPTA. (5.4) •Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression: May occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue ARNUITY ELLIPTA slowly. (5.5) •Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue ARNUITY ELLIPTA and institute alternative therapy if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs. (5.7) •Decreases in bone mineral density: Monitor patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content. (5.9) •Monitor growth of adolescent patients. (5.10) •Close monitoring for glaucoma and cataracts is warranted. (5.11) 5.1 Local Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred in subjects treated with ARNUITY ELLIPTA. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with ARNUITY ELLIPTA continues, but at times therapy with ARNUITY ELLIPTA may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. 5.2 Acute Asthma Episodes ARNUITY ELLIPTA is not indicated for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist, not ARNUITY ELLIPTA, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing ARNUITY ELLIPTA, the physician must provide the patient with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular once-daily use of ARNUITY ELLIPTA. Instruct patients to contact their physicians immediately if episodes of asthma not responsive to bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with ARNUITY ELLIPTA. During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids. 5.3 Immunosuppression Persons using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such patients who have not had these diseases or who have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. 5.4 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although ARNUITY ELLIPTA may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to ARNUITY ELLIPTA. Lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to ARNUITY ELLIPTA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression), despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression ARNUITY ELLIPTA will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since ARNUITY ELLIPTA is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of ARNUITY ELLIPTA in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with ARNUITY ELLIPTA should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when fluticasone furoate is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time. If such effects occur, the dosage of ARNUITY ELLIPTA should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms. 5.6 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of ARNUITY ELLIPTA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole) because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms As with other inhaled medicines, bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with ARNUITY ELLIPTA, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; ARNUITY ELLIPTA should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria, flushing, allergic dermatitis, and bronchospasm may occur after administration of ARNUITY ELLIPTA. Discontinue ARNUITY ELLIPTA if such reactions occur. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use ARNUITY ELLIPTA [see Contraindications (4.2)]. 5.9 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term outcomes, such as fracture, is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids), should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. 5.10 Effect on Growth Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ARNUITY ELLIPTA, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to children and adolescents. Monitor the growth of children and adolescents receiving ARNUITY ELLIPTA routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ARNUITY ELLIPTA, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.11 Glaucoma and Cataracts Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients following the long‑term administration of inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Fluticasone furoate is cleared by extensive first-pass metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. In a drug interaction trial of intranasal fluticasone furoate and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole given as a 200-mg once-daily dose for 7 days, 6 of 20 subjects receiving fluticasone furoate and ketoconazole had measurable but low levels of fluticasone furoate compared with 1 of 20 receiving fluticasone furoate and placebo. Based on this trial and the low systemic exposure, there was a 5% reduction in 24-hour serum cortisol levels with ketoconazole compared with placebo. The data from this trial should be carefully interpreted because the trial was conducted with ketoconazole 200 mg once daily rather than 400 mg, which is the maximum recommended dosage. Therefore, caution is required with the coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray and ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Based on data with another glucocorticoid, fluticasone propionate, metabolized by CYP3A4, coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of systemic effects secondary to increased exposure to fluticasone furoate. High exposure to corticosteroids increases the potential for systemic side effects, such as cortisol suppression. Enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that fluticasone furoate is unlikely to significantly alter the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of other compounds at clinically relevant intranasal dosages."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following: •Epistaxis, ulcerations, Candida albicans infection, impaired wound healing, and nasal septal perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Cataracts and glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] •Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] •Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effects, including growth reduction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] The safety data described below reflect exposure to VERAMYST Nasal Spray in 1,563 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in 9 controlled clinical trials of 2 to 12 weeks’ duration. The data from adults and adolescents are based upon 6 clinical trials in which 768 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (473 females and 295 males aged 12 years and older) were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily for 2 to 6 weeks. The racial distribution of adult and adolescent patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was 82% white, 5% black, and 13% other. The data from pediatric patients are based upon 3 clinical trials in which 795 children with seasonal or perennial rhinitis (352 females and 443 males aged 2 to 11 years) were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 55 or 110 mcg once daily for 2 to 12 weeks. The racial distribution of pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was 75% white, 11% black, and 14% other. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults and Adolescents Aged 12 Years and Older Overall adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray and those receiving placebo. Less than 3% of patients in clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. The rate of withdrawal among patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was similar or lower than the rate among patients receiving placebo. Table 1 displays the common adverse reactions (>1% in any patient group receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray) that occurred more frequently in patients aged 12 years and older treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray compared with placebo-treated patients. Table 1. Adverse Reactions with >1% Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 to 6 Weeks’ Duration with VERAMYST Nasal Spray in Adult and Adolescent Patients with Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Event Adult and Adolescent Patients Aged 12 Years and Older Vehicle Placebo (n = 774) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg Once Daily (n = 768) Headache 54 (7%) 72 (9%) Epistaxis 32 (4%) 45 (6%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 8 (1%) 15 (2%) Nasal ulceration 3 (<1%) 11 (1%) Back pain 7 (<1%) 9 (1%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to 11 Years In the 3 clinical trials in pediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years, overall adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray and those receiving placebo. Table 2 displays the common adverse reactions (>3% in any patient group receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray), that occurred more frequently in patients aged 2 to 11 years treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray compared with placebo-treated patients. Table 2. Adverse Reactions with >3% Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 to 12 Weeks’ Duration with VERAMYST Nasal Spray in Pediatric Patients with Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Event Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to <12 Years Vehicle Placebo (n = 429) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 55 mcg Once Daily (n = 369) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg Once Daily (n = 426) Headache 31 (7%) 28 (8%) 33 (8%) Nasopharyngitis 21 (5%) 20 (5%) 21 (5%) Epistaxis 19 (4%) 17 (5%) 17 (4%) Pyrexia 7 (2%) 17 (5%) 19 (4%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 14 (3%) 16 (4%) 12 (3%) Cough 12 (3%) 12 (3%) 16 (4%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Pyrexia occurred more frequently in children aged 2 to <6 years compared with children aged 6 to <12 years. Long-term (52-Week) Safety Trial In a 52-week, placebo-controlled, long-term safety trial, 605 patients (307 females and 298 males aged 12 years and older) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily for 12 months and 201 were treated with placebo nasal spray. While most adverse reactions were similar in type and rate between the treatment groups, epistaxis occurred more frequently in patients who received VERAMYST Nasal Spray (123/605, 20%) than in patients who received placebo (17/201, 8%). Epistaxis tended to be more severe in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray. All 17 reports of epistaxis that occurred in patients who received placebo were of mild intensity, while 83, 39, and 1 of the total 123 epistaxis events in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray were of mild, moderate, and severe intensity, respectively. No patient experienced a nasal septal perforation during this trial. In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone furoate or a combination of these factors. Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria. Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Rhinalgia, nasal discomfort (including nasal burning, nasal irritation, and nasal soreness), nasal dryness, and nasal septal perforation."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Epistaxis, nasal ulceration, Candida albicans infection, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. ( 5.1 )•Development of glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts. Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. ( 5.2 )•Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria, may occur after administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. ( 5.3 )•Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. ( 5.4 )•Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue VERAMYST Nasal Spray slowly. ( 5.5 )•Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray. ( 5.7 , 8.4 ) Epistaxis and Nasal Ulceration In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks’ duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were observed more frequently and some epistaxis events were more severe in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Candida Infection Evidence of localized infections of the nose with Candida albicans was seen on nasal exams in 7 of 2,745 patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray during clinical trials and was reported as an adverse event in 3 patients. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Therefore, patients using VERAMYST Nasal Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Nasal Septal Perforation Postmarketing cases of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of VERAMYST Nasal Spray [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Impaired Wound Healing Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use VERAMYST Nasal Spray until healing has occurred. Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation was evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in 1 controlled 12-month trial in 806 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older and in 1 controlled 12-week trial in 558 children aged 2 to 11 years. The patients had perennial allergic rhinitis and were treated with either VERAMYST Nasal Spray (110 mcg once daily in adult and adolescent patients and 55 or 110 mcg once daily in pediatric patients) or placebo. Intraocular pressure remained within the normal range (<21 mmHg) in ≥98% of the patients in any treatment group in both trials. However, in the 12-month trial in adolescents and adults, 12 patients, all treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily, had intraocular pressure measurements that increased above normal levels (≥21 mmHg). In the same trial, 7 patients (6 treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily and 1 patient treated with placebo) had cataracts identified during the trial that were not present at baseline. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria, may occur after administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Discontinue VERAMYST Nasal Spray if such reactions occur [see Contraindications (4)]. Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox or measles develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract, untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections, systemic viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression When intranasal steroids are used at higher-than-recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of VERAMYST Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, rapid decreases in systemic corticosteroid dosages may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. Coadministration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of systemic effects secondary to increased exposure to fluticasone furoate. Use caution with the coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray and other potent cytochrome P450 3A4(CYP3A4) inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including VERAMYST Nasal Spray, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS •Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Use with caution. May cause systemic corticosteroid and cardiovascular effects. ( 7.1 )•Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution. May potentiate effect of vilanterol on vascular system. ( 7.2 )•Beta-blockers: Use with caution. May block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. ( 7.3 )•Diuretics: Use with caution. Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non–potassium-sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists. ( 7.4 ) Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol, the individual components of BREO ELLIPTA, are both substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increases the systemic exposure to fluticasone furoate and vilanterol. Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of BREO ELLIPTA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Vilanterol, like other beta 2-agonists, should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or drugs known to prolong the QTc interval or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the effect of adrenergic agonists on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents. Drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as vilanterol, a component of BREO ELLIPTA, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with COPD or asthma. Therefore, patients with COPD or asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. The electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non‑potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non–potassium-sparing diuretics."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS LABA, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Currently available data are inadequate to determine whether concurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term asthma control drugs mitigates the increased risk of asthma-related death from LABA. Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. Data from a large placebo-controlled US trial that compared the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) or placebo added to usual asthma therapy showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following: • Candida albicans infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] •Increased risk of pneumonia in COPD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] •Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] •Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] •Reduction in bone mineral density [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical program for BREO ELLIPTA included 7,700 subjects with COPD in two 6-month lung function trials, two 12-month exacerbation trials, and 6 other trials of shorter duration. A total of 2,034 subjects with COPD received at least 1 dose of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, and 1,087 subjects received a higher strength of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. The safety data described below are based on the confirmatory 6- and 12-month trials. Adverse reactions observed in the other trials were similar to those observed in the confirmatory trials. 6-Month Trials The incidence of adverse reactions associated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 in Table 1 is based on 2 placebo-controlled, 6-month clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2; n = 1,224 and n = 1,030, respectively). Of the 2,254 subjects, 70% were male and 84% were white. They had a mean age of 62 years and an average smoking history of 44 pack-years, with 54% identified as current smokers. At screening, the mean postbronchodilator percent predicted FEV 1 was 48% (range: 14% to 87%), the mean postbronchodilator FEV 1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio was 47% (range: 17% to 88%), and the mean percent reversibility was 14% (range: -41% to 152%). Subjects received 1 inhalation once daily of the following: BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, BREO ELLIPTA 200/25, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, fluticasone furoate 200 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, or placebo.

Trials 3 and 4 included 3,255 subjects, of which 57% were male and 85% were white. They had a mean age of 64 years and an average smoking history of 46 pack-years, with 44% identified as current smokers. At screening, the mean postbronchodilator percent predicted FEV 1 was 45% (range: 12% to 91%), and the mean postbronchodilator FEV 1/FVC ratio was 46% (range: 17% to 81%), indicating that the subject population had moderate to very severely impaired airflow obstruction. Subjects received 1 inhalation once daily of the following: BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, BREO ELLIPTA 200/25, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg, or vilanterol 25 mcg. In addition to the reactions shown in Table 1, adverse reactions occurring in greater than or equal to 3% of the subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 (n = 806) for 12 months included back pain, pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], bronchitis, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, arthralgia, influenza, pharyngitis, and pyrexia. BREO ELLIPTA for the treatment of asthma was studied in 18 double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trials (11 with placebo) of 4 to 76 weeks’ duration, which enrolled 9,969 subjects with asthma. BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 was studied in 2,369 subjects and BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 was studied in 956 subjects. While subjects aged 12 to 17 years were included in these trials, BREO ELLIPTA is not approved for use in this age-group [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. The safety data described below are based on two 12-week efficacy trials, one 24-week efficacy trial, and two long-term trials. 12-Week Trials Trial 1 was a 12-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma compared with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg and placebo. Of the 609 subjects, 58% were female and 84% were white; the mean age was 40 years. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 is shown in Table 2. Table 2.

Trial 2 was a 12-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, BREO ELLIPTA 200/25, and fluticasone furoate 100 mcg in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma. This trial did not have a placebo arm. Of the 1,039 subjects, 60% were female and 88% were white; the mean age was 46 years. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 and BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Adverse Reactions with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 and BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 with ≥2% Incidence in Subjects with Asthma (Trial 2) Adverse Reaction BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 (n = 346) % BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 (n = 346) % Fluticasone Furoate 100 mcg (n = 347) % Nervous system disorders Headache 8 8 9 Infections and infestations Nasopharyngitis 7 6 7 Influenza 3 3 1 Upper respiratory tract infection 2 2 3 Sinusitis 2 1 <1 Bronchitis 2 <1 2 Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Oropharyngeal pain 2 2 1 Cough 1 2 1 24-Week Trial Trial 3 was a 24-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily, fluticasone furoate 200 mcg once daily, and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma. Of the 586 subjects, 59% were female and 84% were white; the mean age was 46 years. This trial did not have a placebo arm. In addition to the reactions shown in Tables 2 and 3, adverse reactions occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 included viral respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pyrexia, and arthralgia. 12-Month Trial Long-term safety data is based on a 12-month trial that evaluated the safety of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily (n = 201), BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily (n = 202), and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily (n = 100) in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma (Trial 4). Overall, 63% were female and 67% were white. The mean age was 39 years; adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) made up 16% of the population. In addition to the reactions shown in Tables 2 and 3, adverse reactions occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of the subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 for 12 months included pyrexia, back pain, extrasystoles, upper abdominal pain, respiratory tract infection, allergic rhinitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, arthralgia, supraventricular extrasystoles, ventricular extrasystoles, acute sinusitis, and pneumonia. Exacerbation Trial In a 24- to 76-week trial, subjects received BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 (n = 1,009) or fluticasone furoate 100 mcg (n = 1,010) (Trial 5). Subjects participating in this trial had a history of one or more asthma exacerbations that required treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroids or emergency department visit or in-patient hospitalization for the treatment of asthma in the year prior to trial entry. Overall, 67% were female and 73% were white; the mean age was 42 years (adolescents aged 12 to 17 years made up 14% of the population). While subjects aged 12 to 17 years were included in this trial, BREO ELLIPTA is not approved for use in this age-group [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Asthma-related hospitalizations occurred in 10 subjects (1%) treated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 compared with 7 subjects (0.7%) treated with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg. Among subjects aged 12 to 17 years, asthma-related hospitalizations occurred in 4 subjects (2.6%) treated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 (n = 151) compared with 0 subjects treated with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg (n = 130). There were no asthma-related deaths or asthma-related intubations observed in this trial. In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BREO ELLIPTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •LABA increase the risk of asthma-related death and asthma-related hospitalizations. Prescribe only for recommended patient populations. ( 5.1 )•Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. Do not use to treat acute symptoms. ( 5.2 )•Do not use in combination with an additional medicine containing a LABA because of risk of overdose. ( 5.3 )• Candida albicans infection of the mouth and pharynx may occur. Monitor patients periodically. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation to help reduce the risk. ( 5.4 ) •Increased risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonia. ( 5.5 )•Potential worsening of infections (e.g., existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; ocular herpes simplex). Use with caution in patients with these infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients. ( 5.6 )•Risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from systemic corticosteroids. Taper patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to BREO ELLIPTA. ( 5.7 )•Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue BREO ELLIPTA slowly. ( 5.8 )•If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue BREO ELLIPTA and institute alternative therapy. ( 5.10 )•Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation. ( 5.12 )•Assess for decrease in bone mineral density initially and periodically thereafter. ( 5.13 )•Close monitoring for glaucoma and cataracts is warranted. ( 5.14 )•Use with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis. ( 5.15 )•Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. ( 5.16 ) LABA, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Currently available data are inadequate to determine whether concurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term asthma control drugs mitigates the increased risk of asthma-related death from LABA. Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, physicians should only prescribe BREO ELLIPTA for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (e.g., discontinue BREO ELLIPTA) if possible without loss of asthma control and maintain the patient on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids. A 28-week, placebo-controlled, US trial that compared the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in subjects treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in subjects treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA, including vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA. No trial adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA has been conducted. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by LABA. BREO ELLIPTA should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of COPD or asthma. BREO ELLIPTA has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. The initiation of BREO ELLIPTA in this setting is not appropriate. COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction; the patient’s inhaled, short-acting, beta 2-agonist becomes less effective; or the patient needs more short-acting beta 2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting a reevaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. For COPD, increasing the daily dose of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 is not appropriate in this situation. Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta 2-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of BREO ELLIPTA with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation once daily of BREO ELLIPTA. BREO ELLIPTA should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. BREO ELLIPTA has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta 2-agonist. When beginning treatment with BREO ELLIPTA, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta 2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and to use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing BREO ELLIPTA, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta 2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. BREO ELLIPTA should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using BREO ELLIPTA should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason. In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred in subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with BREO ELLIPTA continues, but at times therapy with BREO ELLIPTA may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. An increase in the incidence of pneumonia has been observed in subjects with COPD receiving BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 in clinical trials. There was also an increased incidence of pneumonias resulting in hospitalization. In some incidences these pneumonia events were fatal. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. In replicate 12-month trials in 3,255 subjects with COPD who had experienced a COPD exacerbation in the previous year, there was a higher incidence of pneumonia reported in subjects receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg: 6% (48 of 820 subjects); BREO ELLIPTA 100/25: 6% (51 of 806 subjects); or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25: 7% (55 of 811 subjects) than in subjects receiving vilanterol 25 mcg: 3% (27 of 818 subjects). There was no fatal pneumonia in subjects receiving vilanterol or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg. There was fatal pneumonia in 1 subject receiving BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 and in 7 subjects receiving BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 (less than 1% for each treatment group). Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although BREO ELLIPTA may control COPD or asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress, a severe COPD exacerbation, or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, a severe COPD exacerbation, or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to BREO ELLIPTA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with BREO ELLIPTA. Lung function (FEV 1 or peak expiratory flow), beta-agonist use, and COPD or asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to BREO ELLIPTA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. Inhaled fluticasone furoate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active. Effects of fluticasone furoate on the HPA axis are not observed with the therapeutic doses of BREO ELLIPTA. However, exceeding the recommended dosage or coadministration with a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor may result in HPA dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids in sensitive patients, patients treated with BREO ELLIPTA should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, BREO ELLIPTA should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and other treatments for management of COPD or asthma symptoms should be considered. Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of BREO ELLIPTA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole) because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. As with other inhaled medicines, BREO ELLIPTA can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with BREO ELLIPTA, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; BREO ELLIPTA should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria may occur after administration of BREO ELLIPTA. Discontinue BREO ELLIPTA if such reactions occur. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder medications containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use BREO ELLIPTA [see Contraindications (4)]. Vilanterol, like other beta 2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and also cardiac arrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles. If such effects occur, BREO ELLIPTA may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. In healthy subjects, large doses of inhaled fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (4 times the recommended dose of vilanterol, representing a 12- or 10-fold higher systemic exposure than seen in subjects with COPD or asthma, respectively) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, BREO ELLIPTA, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Since patients with COPD often have multiple risk factors for reduced BMD, assessment of BMD is recommended prior to initiating BREO ELLIPTA and periodically thereafter. If significant reductions in BMD are seen and BREO ELLIPTA is still considered medically important for that patient’s COPD therapy, use of medicine to treat or prevent osteoporosis should be strongly considered. Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients with COPD or asthma following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. BREO ELLIPTA, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Beta-agonist medications may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients. In clinical trials evaluating BREO ELLIPTA in subjects with COPD or asthma, there was no evidence of a treatment effect on serum glucose or potassium. Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to children and adolescents. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.4).]"

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fluticasone furoate is cleared by extensive first-pass metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. In a drug interaction study of intranasal fluticasone furoate and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole given as a 200-mg once-daily dose for 7 days, 6 of 20 subjects receiving fluticasone furoate and ketoconazole had measurable but low levels of fluticasone furoate compared with 1 of 20 receiving fluticasone furoate and placebo. Based on this study and the low systemic exposure, there was a 5% reduction in 24-hour serum cortisol levels with ketoconazole compared with placebo. The data from this study should be carefully interpreted because the study was conducted with ketoconazole 200 mg once daily rather than 400 mg, which is the maximum recommended dosage. Therefore, caution is required with the co-administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray and ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Based on data with another glucocorticoid, fluticasone propionate, metabolized by CYP3A4, co-administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of systemic effects secondary to increased exposure to fluticasone furoate. High exposure to corticosteroids increases the potential for systemic side effects, such as cortisol suppression. Enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that fluticasone furoate is unlikely to significantly alter the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of other compounds at clinically relevant intranasal dosages. Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 may increase exposure to fluticasone furoate. Coadministration of ritonavir is not recommended. (5.5, 7) Use caution with coadministration of other potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. (5.6, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following: Epistaxis, ulcerations, Candida albicans infection, impaired wound healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Cataracts and glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effects, including growth reduction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] The most common adverse reactions (>1% incidence) included headache, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, nasal ulceration, back pain, pyrexia, and cough. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The safety data described below reflect exposure to VERAMYST Nasal Spray in 1,563 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in 9 controlled clinical trials of 2 to 12 weeks’ duration. The data from adults and adolescents are based upon 6 clinical trials in which 768 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (473 females and 295 males aged 12 years and older) were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily for 2 to 6 weeks. The racial distribution of adult and adolescent patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was 82% white, 5% black, and 13% other. The data from pediatric patients are based upon 3 clinical trials in which 795 children with seasonal or perennial rhinitis (352 females and 443 males aged 2 to 11 years) were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 55 or 110 mcg once daily for 2 to 12 weeks. The racial distribution of pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was 75% white, 11% black, and 14% other. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults and Adolescents Aged 12 Years and Older Overall adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray and those receiving placebo. Less than 3% of patients in clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. The rate of withdrawal among patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was similar or lower than the rate among patients receiving placebo. Table 1 displays the common adverse reactions (>1% in any patient group receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray) that occurred more frequently in patients aged 12 years and older treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray compared with placebo-treated patients. Table 1. Adverse Reactions With >1% Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 to 6 Weeks’ Duration With VERAMYST Nasal Spray in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Event Adult and Adolescent Patients Aged 12 Years and Older Vehicle Placebo (n = 774) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg Once Daily (n = 768) Headache 54 (7%) 72 (9%) Epistaxis 32 (4%) 45 (6%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 8 (1%) 15 (2%) Nasal ulceration 3 (<1%) 11 (1%) Back pain 7 (<1%) 9 (1%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to 11 Years In the 3 clinical trials in pediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years, overall adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray and those receiving placebo. Table 2 displays the common adverse reactions (>3% in any patient group receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray), that occurred more frequently in patients aged 2 to 11 years treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray compared with placebo-treated patients. Table 2. Adverse Reactions With >3% Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 to 12 Weeks’ Duration With VERAMYST Nasal Spray in Pediatric Patients With Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Event Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to <12 Years Vehicle Placebo (n = 429) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 55 mcg Once Daily (n = 369) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg Once Daily (n = 426) Headache 31 (7%) 28 (8%) 33 (8%) Nasopharyngitis 21 (5%) 20 (5%) 21 (5%) Epistaxis 19 (4%) 17 (5%) 17 (4%) Pyrexia 7 (2%) 17 (5%) 19 (4%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 14 (3%) 16 (4%) 12 (3%) Cough 12 (3%) 12 (3%) 16 (4%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Pyrexia occurred more frequently in children aged 2 to <6 years compared with children aged 6 to <12 years. Long-Term (52-Week) Safety Trial In a 52-week, placebo-controlled, long-term safety trial, 605 patients (307 females and 298 males aged 12 years and older) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily for 12 months and 201 were treated with placebo nasal spray. While most adverse reactions were similar in type and rate between the treatment groups, epistaxis occurred more frequently in patients who received VERAMYST Nasal Spray (123/605, 20%) than in patients who received placebo (17/201, 8%). Epistaxis tended to be more severe in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray. All 17 reports of epistaxis that occurred in patients who received placebo were of mild intensity, while 83, 39, and 1 of the total 123 epistaxis events in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray were of mild, moderate, and severe intensity, respectively. No patient experienced a nasal septal perforation during this trial. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone furoate or a combination of these factors. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Epistaxis, nasal ulceration, Candida albicans infection, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. (5.1) Development of glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts. Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. (5.2) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria, may occur after administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. (5.3) Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. (5.4) Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue VERAMYST Nasal Spray slowly. (5.5) Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray. (5.7, 8.4) 5.1 Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis and Nasal Ulceration In clinical studies of 2 to 52 weeks’ duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were observed more frequently and some epistaxis events were more severe in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Candida Infection Evidence of localized infections of the nose with Candida albicans was seen on nasal exams in 7 of 2,745 patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray during clinical trials and was reported as an adverse event in 3 patients. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Therefore, patients using VERAMYST Nasal Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Nasal Septal Perforation Instances of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal septal perforation observed in clinical studies with VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Impaired Wound Healing Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use VERAMYST Nasal Spray until healing has occurred. 5.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation was evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in 1 controlled 12-month study in 806 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older and in 1 controlled 12-week study in 558 children aged 2 to 11 years. The patients had perennial allergic rhinitis and were treated with either VERAMYST Nasal Spray (110 mcg once daily in adult and adolescent patients and 55 or 110 mcg once daily in pediatric patients) or placebo. Intraocular pressure remained within the normal range (<21 mmHg) in ≥98% of the patients in any treatment group in both studies. However, in the 12-month study in adolescents and adults, 12 patients, all treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily, had intraocular pressure measurements that increased above normal levels (≥21 mmHg). In the same study, 7 patients (6 treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily and 1 patient treated with placebo) had cataracts identified during the study that were not present at baseline. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria, may occur after administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Discontinue VERAMYST Nasal Spray if such reactions occur [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox or measles develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. 5.5 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression When intranasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of VERAMYST Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, rapid decreases in systemic corticosteroid dosages may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Use of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Co-administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of systemic effects secondary to increased exposure to fluticasone furoate. Use caution with the co-administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray and other potent cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.7 Effect on Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including VERAMYST Nasal Spray, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Use with caution. May cause systemic corticosteroid and cardiovascular effects. (7.1) •Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution. May potentiate effect of vilanterol on vascular system. (7.2) •Beta-blockers: Use with caution. May block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. (7.3) •Diuretics: Use with caution. Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non–potassium-sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists. (7.4) 7.1 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol, the individual components of BREO ELLIPTA, are both substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increases the systemic exposure to fluticasone furoate and vilanterol. Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of BREO ELLIPTA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants Vilanterol, like other beta2-agonists, should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or drugs known to prolong the QTc interval or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the effect of adrenergic agonists on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents. Drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. 7.3 Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blocking Agents Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as vilanterol, a component of BREO ELLIPTA, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with COPD or asthma. Therefore, patients with COPD or asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. 7.4 Non–Potassium-Sparing Diuretics The electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non‑potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non–potassium-sparing diuretics."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS LABA, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Currently available data are inadequate to determine whether concurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term asthma control drugs mitigates the increased risk of asthma-related death from LABA. Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. Data from a large placebo-controlled US trial that compared the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) or placebo added to usual asthma therapy showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following: • Candida albicans infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] •Increased risk of pneumonia in COPD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] •Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] •Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] •Reduction in bone mineral density [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. •COPD: Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 3%) are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and oral candidiasis. (6.1) •Asthma: Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2%) are nasopharyngitis, oral candidiasis, headache, influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, dysphonia, and cough.

A total of 2,034 subjects with COPD received at least 1 dose of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, and 1,087 subjects received a higher strength of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol. The safety data described below are based on the confirmatory 6- and 12-month trials. Adverse reactions observed in the other trials were similar to those observed in the confirmatory trials. 6-Month Trials The incidence of adverse reactions associated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 in Table 1 is based on 2 placebo-controlled, 6-month clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2; n = 1,224 and n = 1,030, respectively). Of the 2,254 subjects, 70% were male and 84% were white. They had a mean age of 62 years and an average smoking history of 44 pack-years, with 54% identified as current smokers. At screening, the mean postbronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 was 48% (range: 14% to 87%), the mean postbronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio was 47% (range: 17% to 88%), and the mean percent reversibility was 14% (range: -41% to 152%). Subjects received 1 inhalation once daily of the following: BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, BREO ELLIPTA 200/25, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, fluticasone furoate 200 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, or placebo.

Trials 3 and 4 included 3,255 subjects, of which 57% were male and 85% were white. They had a mean age of 64 years and an average smoking history of 46 pack-years, with 44% identified as current smokers. At screening, the mean postbronchodilator percent predicted FEV1 was 45% (range: 12% to 91%), and the mean postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio was 46% (range: 17% to 81%), indicating that the subject population had moderate to very severely impaired airflow obstruction. Subjects received 1 inhalation once daily of the following: BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, BREO ELLIPTA 200/25, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg, or vilanterol 25 mcg. In addition to the reactions shown in Table 1, adverse reactions occurring in greater than or equal to 3% of the subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 (n = 806) for 12 months included back pain, pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], bronchitis, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, arthralgia, influenza, pharyngitis, and pyrexia. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Asthma BREO ELLIPTA for the treatment of asthma was studied in 18 double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trials (11 with placebo) of 4 to 76 weeks’ duration, which enrolled 9,969 subjects with asthma. BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 was studied in 2,369 subjects and BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 was studied in 956 subjects. While subjects aged 12 to 17 years were included in these trials, BREO ELLIPTA is not approved for use in this age-group [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. The safety data described below are based on two 12-week efficacy trials, one 24-week efficacy trial, and two long-term trials. 12-Week Trials Trial 1 was a 12-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma compared with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg and placebo. Of the 609 subjects, 58% were female and 84% were white; the mean age was 40 years. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 is shown in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 with ≥2% Incidence and More Common than Placebo in Subjects with Asthma (Trial 1) Adverse Reaction BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 (n = 201) % Fluticasone Furoate 100 mcg (n = 205) % Placebo (n = 203) % Infections and infestations Nasopharyngitis 10 7 7 Oral candidiasis a 2 2 0 Nervous system disorders Headache 5 4 4 Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders Oropharyngeal pain 2 2 1 Dysphonia 2 1 0 aIncludes oral candidiasis and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Trial 2 was a 12-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, BREO ELLIPTA 200/25, and fluticasone furoate 100 mcg in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma. This trial did not have a placebo arm. Of the 1,039 subjects, 60% were female and 88% were white; the mean age was 46 years. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 and BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Adverse Reactions with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 and BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 with ≥2% Incidence in Subjects with Asthma (Trial 2) Adverse Reaction BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 (n = 346) % BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 (n = 346) % Fluticasone Furoate 100 mcg (n = 347) % Nervous system disorders Headache 8 8 9 Infections and infestations Nasopharyngitis 7 6 7 Influenza 3 3 1 Upper respiratory tract infection 2 2 3 Sinusitis 2 1 <1 Bronchitis 2 <1 2 Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Oropharyngeal pain 2 2 1 Cough 1 2 1 24-Week Trial Trial 3 was a 24-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily, fluticasone furoate 200 mcg once daily, and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma. Of the 586 subjects, 59% were female and 84% were white; the mean age was 46 years. This trial did not have a placebo arm. In addition to the reactions shown in Tables 2 and 3, adverse reactions occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 included viral respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pyrexia, and arthralgia. 12-Month Trial Long-term safety data is based on a 12-month trial that evaluated the safety of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily (n = 201), BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily (n = 202), and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily (n = 100) in adolescent and adult subjects with asthma (Trial 4). Overall, 63% were female and 67% were white. The mean age was 39 years; adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) made up 16% of the population. In addition to the reactions shown in Tables 2 and 3, adverse reactions occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of the subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 for 12 months included pyrexia, back pain, extrasystoles, upper abdominal pain, respiratory tract infection, allergic rhinitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, arthralgia, supraventricular extrasystoles, ventricular extrasystoles, acute sinusitis, and pneumonia. Exacerbation Trial In a 24- to 76-week trial, subjects received BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 (n = 1,009) or fluticasone furoate 100 mcg (n = 1,010) (Trial 5). Subjects participating in this trial had a history of one or more asthma exacerbations that required treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroids or emergency department visit or in-patient hospitalization for the treatment of asthma in the year prior to trial entry. Overall, 67% were female and 73% were white; the mean age was 42 years (adolescents aged 12 to 17 years made up 14% of the population). While subjects aged 12 to 17 years were included in this trial, BREO ELLIPTA is not approved for use in this age-group [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Asthma-related hospitalizations occurred in 10 subjects (1%) treated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 compared with 7 subjects (0.7%) treated with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg. Among subjects aged 12 to 17 years, asthma-related hospitalizations occurred in 4 subjects (2.6%) treated with BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 (n = 151) compared with 0 subjects treated with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg (n = 130). There were no asthma-related deaths or asthma-related intubations observed in this trial. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of BREO ELLIPTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to BREO ELLIPTA or a combination of these factors. Cardiac Disorders Palpitations, tachycardia. Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Muscle spasms. Nervous System Disorders Tremor. Psychiatric Disorders Nervousness."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •LABA increase the risk of asthma-related death and asthma-related hospitalizations. Prescribe only for recommended patient populations. (5.1) •Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. Do not use to treat acute symptoms. (5.2) •Do not use in combination with an additional medicine containing a LABA because of risk of overdose. (5.3) • Candida albicans infection of the mouth and pharynx may occur. Monitor patients periodically. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation to help reduce the risk. (5.4) •Increased risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonia. (5.5) •Potential worsening of infections (e.g., existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; ocular herpes simplex). Use with caution in patients with these infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients. (5.6) •Risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from systemic corticosteroids. Taper patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to BREO ELLIPTA. (5.7) •Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue BREO ELLIPTA slowly. (5.8) •If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue BREO ELLIPTA and institute alternative therapy. (5.10) •Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation. (5.12) •Assess for decrease in bone mineral density initially and periodically thereafter. (5.13) •Close monitoring for glaucoma and cataracts is warranted. (5.14) •Use with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis. (5.15) •Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. (5.16) 5.1 Asthma-Related Death LABA, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Currently available data are inadequate to determine whether concurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term asthma control drugs mitigates the increased risk of asthma-related death from LABA. Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, physicians should only prescribe BREO ELLIPTA for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (e.g., discontinue BREO ELLIPTA) if possible without loss of asthma control and maintain the patient on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids. A 28-week, placebo-controlled, US trial that compared the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in subjects treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in subjects treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA, including vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA. No trial adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA has been conducted. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by LABA. 5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes BREO ELLIPTA should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of COPD or asthma. BREO ELLIPTA has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. The initiation of BREO ELLIPTA in this setting is not appropriate. COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction; the patient’s inhaled, short-acting, beta2-agonist becomes less effective; or the patient needs more short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting a reevaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. For COPD, increasing the daily dose of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 is not appropriate in this situation. Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of BREO ELLIPTA with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation once daily of BREO ELLIPTA. BREO ELLIPTA should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. BREO ELLIPTA has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist. When beginning treatment with BREO ELLIPTA, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and to use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing BREO ELLIPTA, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. 5.3 Excessive Use of BREO ELLIPTA and Use with Other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists BREO ELLIPTA should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using BREO ELLIPTA should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason. 5.4 Local Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred in subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with BREO ELLIPTA continues, but at times therapy with BREO ELLIPTA may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. 5.5 Pneumonia An increase in the incidence of pneumonia has been observed in subjects with COPD receiving BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 in clinical trials. There was also an increased incidence of pneumonias resulting in hospitalization. In some incidences these pneumonia events were fatal. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. In replicate 12-month trials in 3,255 subjects with COPD who had experienced a COPD exacerbation in the previous year, there was a higher incidence of pneumonia reported in subjects receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg: 6% (48 of 820 subjects); BREO ELLIPTA 100/25: 6% (51 of 806 subjects); or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25: 7% (55 of 811 subjects) than in subjects receiving vilanterol 25 mcg: 3% (27 of 818 subjects). There was no fatal pneumonia in subjects receiving vilanterol or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg. There was fatal pneumonia in 1 subject receiving BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 and in 7 subjects receiving BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 (less than 1% for each treatment group). 5.6 Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. 5.7 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although BREO ELLIPTA may control COPD or asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress, a severe COPD exacerbation, or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, a severe COPD exacerbation, or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to BREO ELLIPTA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with BREO ELLIPTA. Lung function (FEV1 or peak expiratory flow), beta-agonist use, and COPD or asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to BREO ELLIPTA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. 5.8 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression Inhaled fluticasone furoate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active. Effects of fluticasone furoate on the HPA axis are not observed with the therapeutic doses of BREO ELLIPTA. However, exceeding the recommended dosage or coadministration with a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor may result in HPA dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids in sensitive patients, patients treated with BREO ELLIPTA should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, BREO ELLIPTA should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and other treatments for management of COPD or asthma symptoms should be considered. 5.9 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of BREO ELLIPTA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole) because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.10 Paradoxical Bronchospasm As with other inhaled medicines, BREO ELLIPTA can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with BREO ELLIPTA, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; BREO ELLIPTA should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. 5.11 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria may occur after administration of BREO ELLIPTA. Discontinue BREO ELLIPTA if such reactions occur. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder medications containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use BREO ELLIPTA [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.12 Cardiovascular Effects Vilanterol, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and also cardiac arrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles. If such effects occur, BREO ELLIPTA may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. In healthy subjects, large doses of inhaled fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (4 times the recommended dose of vilanterol, representing a 12- or 10-fold higher systemic exposure than seen in subjects with COPD or asthma, respectively) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, BREO ELLIPTA, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. 5.13 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Since patients with COPD often have multiple risk factors for reduced BMD, assessment of BMD is recommended prior to initiating BREO ELLIPTA and periodically thereafter. If significant reductions in BMD are seen and BREO ELLIPTA is still considered medically important for that patient’s COPD therapy, use of medicine to treat or prevent osteoporosis should be strongly considered. 5.14 Glaucoma and Cataracts Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients with COPD or asthma following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. 5.15 Coexisting Conditions BREO ELLIPTA, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. 5.16 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Beta-agonist medications may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients. In clinical trials evaluating BREO ELLIPTA in subjects with COPD or asthma, there was no evidence of a treatment effect on serum glucose or potassium. 5.17 Effect on Growth Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to children and adolescents.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Fluticasone furoate is cleared by extensive first-pass metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. In a drug interaction study of intranasal fluticasone furoate and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole given as a 200-mg once-daily dose for 7 days, 6 of 20 subjects receiving fluticasone furoate and ketoconazole had measurable but low levels of fluticasone furoate compared with 1 of 20 receiving fluticasone furoate and placebo. Based on this study and the low systemic exposure, there was a 5% reduction in 24-hour serum cortisol levels with ketoconazole compared with placebo. The data from this study should be carefully interpreted because the study was conducted with ketoconazole 200 mg once daily rather than 400 mg, which is the maximum recommended dosage. Therefore, caution is required with the coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray and ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Based on data with another glucocorticoid, fluticasone propionate, metabolized by CYP3A4, coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of systemic effects secondary to increased exposure to fluticasone furoate. High exposure to corticosteroids increases the potential for systemic side effects, such as cortisol suppression.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following: •Epistaxis, ulcerations, Candida albicans infection, impaired wound healing, and nasal septal perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Cataracts and glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] •Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] •Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effects, including growth reduction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] The safety data described below reflect exposure to VERAMYST Nasal Spray in 1,563 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis in 9 controlled clinical trials of 2 to 12 weeks’ duration. The data from adults and adolescents are based upon 6 clinical trials in which 768 patients with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (473 females and 295 males aged 12 years and older) were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily for 2 to 6 weeks. The racial distribution of adult and adolescent patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was 82% white, 5% black, and 13% other. The data from pediatric patients are based upon 3 clinical trials in which 795 children with seasonal or perennial rhinitis (352 females and 443 males aged 2 to 11 years) were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 55 or 110 mcg once daily for 2 to 12 weeks. The racial distribution of pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was 75% white, 11% black, and 14% other. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults and Adolescents Aged 12 Years and Older: Overall adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray and those receiving placebo. Less than 3% of patients in clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. The rate of withdrawal among patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray was similar or lower than the rate among patients receiving placebo. Table 1 displays the common adverse reactions (>1% in any patient group receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray) that occurred more frequently in patients aged 12 years and older treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray compared with placebo-treated patients. Table 1. Adverse Reactions With >1% Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 to 6 Weeks’ Duration With VERAMYST Nasal Spray in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Event Adult and Adolescent Patients Aged 12 Years and Older Vehicle Placebo (n = 774) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg Once Daily (n = 768) Headache 54 (7%) 72 (9%) Epistaxis 32 (4%) 45 (6%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 8 (1%) 15 (2%) Nasal ulceration 3 (<1%) 11 (1%) Back pain 7 (<1%) 9 (1%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to 11 Years: In the 3 clinical trials in pediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years, overall adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray and those receiving placebo. Table 2 displays the common adverse reactions (>3% in any patient group receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray), that occurred more frequently in patients aged 2 to 11 years treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray compared with placebo-treated patients. Table 2. Adverse Reactions With >3% Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials of 2 to 12 Weeks’ Duration With VERAMYST Nasal Spray in Pediatric Patients With Seasonal or Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Event Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to <12 Years Vehicle Placebo (n = 429) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 55 mcg Once Daily (n = 369) VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg Once Daily (n = 426) Headache 31 (7%) 28 (8%) 33 (8%) Nasopharyngitis 21 (5%) 20 (5%) 21 (5%) Epistaxis 19 (4%) 17 (5%) 17 (4%) Pyrexia 7 (2%) 17 (5%) 19 (4%) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 14 (3%) 16 (4%) 12 (3%) Cough 12 (3%) 12 (3%) 16 (4%) There were no differences in the incidence of adverse reactions based on gender or race. Pyrexia occurred more frequently in children aged 2 to <6 years compared with children aged 6 to <12 years. Long-Term (52-Week) Safety Trial: In a 52-week, placebo-controlled, long-term safety trial, 605 patients (307 females and 298 males aged 12 years and older) with perennial allergic rhinitis were treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily for 12 months and 201 were treated with placebo nasal spray. While most adverse reactions were similar in type and rate between the treatment groups, epistaxis occurred more frequently in patients who received VERAMYST Nasal Spray (123/605, 20%) than in patients who received placebo (17/201, 8%). Epistaxis tended to be more severe in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray. All 17 reports of epistaxis that occurred in patients who received placebo were of mild intensity, while 83, 39, and 1 of the total 123 epistaxis events in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray were of mild, moderate, and severe intensity, respectively. No patient experienced a nasal septal perforation during this trial. In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone furoate or a combination of these factors. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria. Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: Rhinalgia, nasal discomfort (including nasal burning, nasal irritation, and nasal soreness), nasal dryness, and nasal septal perforation."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Epistaxis, nasal ulceration, Candida albicans infection, nasal septal perforation, impaired wound healing. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. (5.1)•Development of glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts. Monitor patients closely with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. (5.2)•Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria, may occur after administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. (5.3)•Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles in susceptible patients. Use caution in patients with the above because of the potential for worsening of these infections. (5.4)•Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue VERAMYST Nasal Spray slowly. (5.5)•Potential reduction in growth velocity in children. Monitor growth routinely in pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray. (5.7, 8.4) Epistaxis and Nasal Ulceration: In clinical studies of 2 to 52 weeks’ duration, epistaxis and nasal ulcerations were observed more frequently and some epistaxis events were more severe in patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray than those who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Candida Infection: Evidence of localized infections of the nose with Candida albicans was seen on nasal exams in 7 of 2,745 patients treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray during clinical trials and was reported as an adverse event in 3 patients. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Therefore, patients using VERAMYST Nasal Spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Nasal Septal Perforation: Postmarketing cases of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of VERAMYST Nasal Spray [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Impaired Wound Healing: Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use VERAMYST Nasal Spray until healing has occurred. Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation was evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in 1 controlled 12-month study in 806 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older and in 1 controlled 12-week study in 558 children aged 2 to 11 years. The patients had perennial allergic rhinitis and were treated with either VERAMYST Nasal Spray (110 mcg once daily in adult and adolescent patients and 55 or 110 mcg once daily in pediatric patients) or placebo. Intraocular pressure remained within the normal range (<21 mmHg) in ≥98% of the patients in any treatment group in both studies. However, in the 12-month study in adolescents and adults, 12 patients, all treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily, had intraocular pressure measurements that increased above normal levels (≥21 mmHg). In the same study, 7 patients (6 treated with VERAMYST Nasal Spray 110 mcg once daily and 1 patient treated with placebo) had cataracts identified during the study that were not present at baseline. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria, may occur after administration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray. Discontinue VERAMYST Nasal Spray if such reactions occur [see Contraindications (4)]. Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox or measles develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract, untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections, systemic viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression: When intranasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of VERAMYST Nasal Spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, rapid decreases in systemic corticosteroid dosages may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. Coadministration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of systemic effects secondary to increased exposure to fluticasone furoate. Use caution with the coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray and other potent cytochrome P450 3A4(CYP3A4) inhibitors, such as ketoconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving VERAMYST Nasal Spray. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including VERAMYST Nasal Spray, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fluticasone furoate is cleared by extensive first-pass metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. In a drug interaction trial of intranasal fluticasone furoate and the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole given as a 200-mg once-daily dose for 7 days, 6 of 20 subjects receiving fluticasone furoate and ketoconazole had measurable but low levels of fluticasone furoate compared with 1 of 20 receiving fluticasone furoate and placebo. Based on this trial and the low systemic exposure, there was a 5% reduction in 24-hour serum cortisol levels with ketoconazole compared with placebo. The data from this trial should be carefully interpreted because the trial was conducted with ketoconazole 200 mg once daily rather than 400 mg, which is the maximum recommended dosage. Therefore, caution is required with the coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray and ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Based on data with another glucocorticoid, fluticasone propionate, metabolized by CYP3A4, coadministration of VERAMYST Nasal Spray with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of systemic effects secondary to increased exposure to fluticasone furoate. High exposure to corticosteroids increases the potential for systemic side effects, such as cortisol suppression. Enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that fluticasone furoate is unlikely to significantly alter the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of other compounds at clinically relevant intranasal dosages. Potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) may increase exposure to fluticasone furoate. •Coadministration of ritonavir is not recommended. (5.6, 7) •Use caution with coadministration of other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. (5.6, 7)"
