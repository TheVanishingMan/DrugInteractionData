        "Drug Interactions Concomitant dermatologic medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of TAZORAC ® Gel is begun. In a study of 27 healthy female subjects between the ages of 20–55 years receiving a combination oral contraceptive tablet containing 1 mg norethindrone and 35 mcg ethynyl estradiol, concomitant use of tazarotene did not affect the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethynyl estradiol over a complete cycle. The impact of tazarotene on the pharmacokinetics of progestin only oral contraceptives (i.e., minipills) has not been evaluated."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In human dermal safety studies, tazarotene 0.05% and 0.1% gels did not induce allergic contact sensitization, phototoxicity or photoallergy. Psoriasis: The most frequent adverse events reported with TAZORAC ® Gel 0.05% and 0.1% were limited to the skin. Those occurring in 10 to 30% of patients, in descending order, included pruritus, burning/stinging, erythema, worsening of psoriasis, irritation, and skin pain. Events occurring in 1 to 10% of patients included rash, desquamation, irritant contact dermatitis, skin inflammation, fissuring, bleeding, and dry skin. Increases in “psoriasis worsening” and “sun-induced erythema” were noted in some patients over the 4th to 12th months as compared to the first three months of a 1 year study. In general, the incidence of adverse events with TAZORAC ® Gel 0.05% was 2 to 5% lower than that seen with TAZORAC ® Gel 0.1%. Acne: The most frequent adverse events reported with TAZORAC ® Gel 0.1% in the treatment of acne occurring in 10 to 30% of patients, in descending order, included desquamation, burning/stinging, dry skin, erythema and pruritus. Events occurring in 1 to 10% of patients included irritation, skin pain, fissuring, localized edema and skin discoloration. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of TAZORAC ® Gel 0.05% and 0.1% in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TAZORAC ® Gel. The reactions include: blister, rash, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), and pain."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Plaque psoriasis: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 23% of patients are pruritus, erythema, and burning. (6.1) Acne Vulgaris: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Allergan, Inc. at 1-800-433-8871 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In human dermal safety trials, TAZORAC ® Cream, 0.05% and 0.1% did not induce allergic contact sensitization, phototoxicity, or photoallergy. Psoriasis The most frequent adverse reactions reported with TAZORAC® Cream, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 23% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, erythema, and burning. Reactions occurring in greater than 1 to less than 10% of subjects, in descending order, included irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema. TAZORAC ® Cream, 0.1% was associated with a greater degree of local irritation than the 0.05% cream. The rates of irritation adverse reactions reported during psoriasis trials with TAZORAC® Cream, 0.1% were 0.1-0.4% higher than those reported for TAZORAC® Cream, 0.05%. Acne The most frequent adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with TAZORAC® Cream 0.1% in the treatment of acne, occurring in 10-30% of subjects, in descending order included desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. Reactions occurring in 1 to 5% of subjects included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryofetal Toxicity: TAZORAC® Cream contains tazarotene, which is a teratogenic substance. TAZORAC® Cream is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. (5.1) Local Irritation: Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or reduce dosing interval, or in the case of psoriasis, may switch to the lower concentration. TAZORAC® Cream should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. (5.2) Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. TAZORAC® Cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. (5.3) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects were found to have been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when TAZORAC® Cream is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to TAZORAC® Cream therapy. TAZORAC ® Cream therapy should begin during a menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Local Irritation Application of TAZORAC ® Cream may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the dosing should be reduced to an interval the patient can tolerate. However, efficacy at reduced frequency of application has not been established. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of TAZORAC® Cream is begun. TAZORAC ® Cream, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using TAZORAC® Cream. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of TAZORAC® Cream. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens (minimum SPF of 15) and protective clothing when using TAZORAC® Cream. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use TAZORAC® Cream until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using TAZORAC® Cream. TAZORAC® Cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity."
