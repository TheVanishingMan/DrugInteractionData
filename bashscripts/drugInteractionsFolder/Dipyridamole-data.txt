        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDS can increase risk of bleeding (7.1) •Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDS (7.1) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosine Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Due to the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking aspirin and extended release dipyridamole capsules in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.1) ]. •Allergy [see Contraindications (4.2) ]. •Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. •The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended release dipyridamole capsules was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended release dipyridamole capsules, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14) ]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended release dipyridamole capsules with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the incidence of adverse events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended release dipyridamole capsules where the incidence was also greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety. Table 1 Incidence of Adverse Events in ESPS2* Individual Treatment Group Body System/Preferred Term ASA/ER-DP ER-DP Alone ASA Alone Placebo * Reported by ≥1% of patients during aspirin and extended release dipyridamole capsules treatment where the incidence was greater than in those treated with placebo. Note: ASA/ER-DP = aspirin 25 mg/extended release dipyridamole 200 mg; ER-DP = extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg; ASA = aspirin 25 mg.

Other Adverse Events Adverse reactions that occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with aspirin and extended release dipyridamole capsules in the ESPS2 study and that were medically judged to be possibly related to either dipyridamole or aspirin are listed below. Body as a Whole: Allergic reaction, fever Cardiovascular: Hypotension Central Nervous System: Coma, dizziness, paresthesia, cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage Gastrointestinal: Gastritis, ulceration and perforation Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: Tinnitus, and deafness. Patients with high frequency hearing loss may have difficulty perceiving tinnitus. In these patients, tinnitus cannot be used as a clinical indicator of salicylism Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitation, arrhythmia, supraventricular tachycardia Liver and Biliary System Disorders: Cholelithiasis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperglycemia, thirst Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: Hematoma, gingival bleeding Psychiatric Disorders: Agitation Reproductive: Uterine hemorrhage Respiratory: Hyperpnea, asthma, bronchospasm, hemoptysis, pulmonary edema Special Senses Other Disorders: Taste loss Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, urticaria Urogenital: Renal insufficiency and failure, hematuria Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders: Flushing Laboratory Changes Over the course of the 24-month study (ESPS2), patients treated with aspirin and extended release dipyridamole capsules showed a decline (mean change from baseline) in hemoglobin of 0.25 g/dL, hematocrit of 0.75%, and erythrocyte count of 0.13x106/mm3. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended release dipyridamole capsules. Body as a Whole: Hypothermia, chest pain Cardiovascular: Angina pectoris Central Nervous System: Cerebral edema Fluid and Electrolyte: Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, hypokalemia Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, Reye syndrome, hematemesis Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: Hearing loss Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity, acute anaphylaxis, laryngeal edema Liver and Biliary System Disorders: Hepatitis, hepatic failure Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hypoglycemia, dehydration Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: Prolongation of the prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia Reproductive: Prolonged pregnancy and labor, stillbirths, lower birth weight infants, antepartum and postpartum bleeding Respiratory: Tachypnea, dyspnea Skin and Appendages Disorders: Rash, alopecia, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin hemorrhages such as bruising, ecchymosis, and hematoma Urogenital: Interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, proteinuria Vascular (Extracardiac Disorders): Allergic vasculitis Other Adverse Events: anorexia, aplastic anemia, migraine, pancytopenia, thrombocytosis."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules increases the risk of bleeding (5.1) •Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency (5.2, 5.3) •Can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, especially in the third trimester (5.4) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Intracranial Hemorrhage In ESPS2 the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.6% in the Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules group, 0.5% in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.4% in the aspirin (ASA) group and 0.4% in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2 the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 4.1% in the Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules group, 2.2% in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 3.2% in the aspirin group, and 2.1% in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Pregnancy Because Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules contains aspirin, Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth weight, increased incidence for intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, stillbirths and neonatal death. Because of the above and because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), avoid Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules in the third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1½, 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat, the resorption rate approached 100%, indicating potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules in pregnant women. If Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.6 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.7 General Aspirin and Extended Release Dipyridamole Capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with AGGRENOX capsules. The following information was obtained from the literature. Co-administration with anti-coagulants or NSAIDS can increase risk of bleeding (7.4, 7.10) Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDS (7.10) 7.1 Adenosine Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. 7.2 Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Due to the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. 7.3 Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. 7.4 Anticoagulant Therapy (heparin and warfarin) Patients on anticoagulation therapy are at increased risk for bleeding because of drug-drug interactions and effects on platelets. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. 7.5 Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. 7.6 Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. 7.7 Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. 7.8 Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. 7.9 Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. 7.10 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. 7.11 Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. 7.12 Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

Risk of Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either AGGRENOX, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the incidence of adverse events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with AGGRENOX where the incidence was also greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

Other Adverse Events Adverse reactions that occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with AGGRENOX in the ESPS2 study and that were medically judged to be possibly related to either dipyridamole or aspirin are listed below. Body as a Whole : Allergic reaction, fever Cardiovascular : Hypotension Central Nervous System : Coma, dizziness, paresthesia, cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage Gastrointestinal : Gastritis, ulceration and perforation Hearing and Vestibular Disorders : Tinnitus, and deafness. Patients with high frequency hearing loss may have difficulty perceiving tinnitus. In these patients, tinnitus cannot be used as a clinical indicator of salicylism Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders : Tachycardia, palpitation, arrhythmia, supraventricular tachycardia Liver and Biliary System Disorders : Cholelithiasis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders : Hyperglycemia, thirst Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders : Hematoma, gingival bleeding Psychiatric Disorders : Agitation Reproductive : Uterine hemorrhage Respiratory : Hyperpnea, asthma, bronchospasm, hemoptysis, pulmonary edema Special Senses Other Disorders : Taste loss Skin and Appendages Disorders : Pruritus, urticaria Urogenital : Renal insufficiency and failure, hematuria Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders : Flushing Laboratory Changes Over the course of the 24-month study (ESPS2), patients treated with AGGRENOX showed a decline (mean change from baseline) in hemoglobin of 0.25 g/dL, hematocrit of 0.75%, and erythrocyte count of 0.13x106/mm3. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AGGRENOX. Body as a Whole : Hypothermia, chest pain Cardiovascular : Angina pectoris Central Nervous System : Cerebral edema Fluid and Electrolyte : Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, hypokalemia Gastrointestinal : Pancreatitis, Reye syndrome, hematemesis Hearing and Vestibular Disorders : Hearing loss Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity, acute anaphylaxis, laryngeal edema Liver and Biliary System Disorders : Hepatitis, hepatic failure Musculoskeletal : Rhabdomyolysis Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders : Hypoglycemia, dehydration Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders : Prolongation of the prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia Reproductive : Prolonged pregnancy and labor, stillbirths, lower birth weight infants, antepartum and postpartum bleeding Respiratory : Tachypnea, dyspnea Skin and Appendages Disorders : Rash, alopecia, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin hemorrhages such as bruising, ecchymosis, and hematoma Urogenital : Interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, proteinuria Vascular (Extracardiac Disorders) : Allergic vasculitis Other adverse events : anorexia, aplastic anemia, migraine, pancytopenia, thrombocytosis."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The risk of GI bleeding is increased, especially in patients who are heavy alcohol users, have a history of peptic ulcer, or have coagulation abnormalities due to liver disease or vitamin K deficiency (5.1) As with other antiplatelets, there is a risk of intracranial hemorrhage (5.1) Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency (5.2, 5.3) Can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, especially in the third trimester (5.4) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Intracranial Hemorrhage In ESPS2 the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.6% in the AGGRENOX group, 0.5% in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.4% in the aspirin (ASA) group and 0.4% in the placebo groups. Coagulation Abnormalities Even low doses of aspirin can inhibit platelet function leading to an increase in bleeding time. This can adversely affect patients with inherited or acquired (liver disease or vitamin K deficiency) bleeding disorders [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2 the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 4.1% in the AGGRENOX group, 2.2% in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 3.2% in the aspirin group, and 2.1% in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Pregnancy Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin, AGGRENOX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth weight, increased incidence for intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, stillbirths and neonatal death. Because of the above and because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), avoid AGGRENOX in the third trimester of pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of AGGRENOX. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1½, 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat, the resorption rate approached 100%, indicating potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of AGGRENOX in pregnant women. If AGGRENOX is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking AGGRENOX, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.6 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.7 General AGGRENOX capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDs can increase risk of bleeding (7.1) Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDs (7.1) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosine Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Due to the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking AGGRENOX in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anagrelide Patients taking aspirin in combination with anagrelide are at an increased risk of bleeding. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [ see Contraindications (4.1) ] Allergy [ see Contraindications (4.2) ] Risk of Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either AGGRENOX, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the incidence of adverse events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with AGGRENOX where the incidence was also greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety. Table 1 Incidence of Adverse Events in ESPS2a Individual Treatment Group AGGRENOX ER-DP Alone ASA Alone Placebo Body System/Preferred Term aReported by ≥1% of patients during AGGRENOX treatment where the incidence was greater than in those treated with placebo.

Other Adverse Events Adverse reactions that occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with AGGRENOX in the ESPS2 study and that were medically judged to be possibly related to either dipyridamole or aspirin are listed below. Body as a Whole: Allergic reaction, fever Cardiovascular: Hypotension Central Nervous System: Coma, dizziness, paresthesia, cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage Gastrointestinal: Gastritis, ulceration and perforation Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: Tinnitus, and deafness. Patients with high frequency hearing loss may have difficulty perceiving tinnitus. In these patients, tinnitus cannot be used as a clinical indicator of salicylism Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitation, arrhythmia, supraventricular tachycardia Liver and Biliary System Disorders: Cholelithiasis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperglycemia, thirst Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: Hematoma, gingival bleeding Psychiatric Disorders: Agitation Reproductive: Uterine hemorrhage Respiratory: Hyperpnea, asthma, bronchospasm, hemoptysis, pulmonary edema Special Senses Other Disorders: Taste loss Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, urticaria Urogenital: Renal insufficiency and failure, hematuria Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders: Flushing Laboratory Changes Over the course of the 24-month study (ESPS2), patients treated with AGGRENOX showed a decline (mean change from baseline) in hemoglobin of 0.25 g/dL, hematocrit of 0.75%, and erythrocyte count of 0.13x106/mm3. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to AGGRENOX. Body as a Whole: Hypothermia, chest pain Cardiovascular: Angina pectoris Central Nervous System: Cerebral edema Fluid and Electrolyte: Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, hypokalemia Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, Reye syndrome, hematemesis Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: Hearing loss Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity, acute anaphylaxis, laryngeal edema Liver and Biliary System Disorders: Hepatitis, hepatic failure Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hypoglycemia, dehydration Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: Prolongation of the prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia Reproductive: Prolonged pregnancy and labor, stillbirths, lower birth weight infants, antepartum and postpartum bleeding Respiratory: Tachypnea, dyspnea Skin and Appendages Disorders: Rash, alopecia, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin hemorrhages such as bruising, ecchymosis, and hematoma Urogenital: Interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, proteinuria Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders: Allergic vasculitis Other Adverse Events: anorexia, aplastic anemia, migraine, pancytopenia, thrombocytosis."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS AGGRENOX increases the risk of bleeding (5.1) Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency (5.2, 5.3) Can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, especially in the third trimester (5.4) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding AGGRENOX increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.6% in the AGGRENOX group, 0.5% in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.4% in the aspirin (ASA) group and 0.4% in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2, the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 4.1% in the AGGRENOX group, 2.2% in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 3.2% in the aspirin group, and 2.1% in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Pregnancy Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin, AGGRENOX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth weight, increased incidence for intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, stillbirths and neonatal death. Because of the above and because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), avoid AGGRENOX in the third trimester of pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of AGGRENOX. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1½, 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat, the resorption rate approached 100%, indicating potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of AGGRENOX in pregnant women. If AGGRENOX is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking AGGRENOX, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.6 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.7 General AGGRENOX capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDS can increase risk of bleeding (7.1) •Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDS (7.1) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Adenosine Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Due to the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: •Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.1)]. •Allergy [see Contraindications (4.2)]. •Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. •The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537, or drug.safety@tevapharm.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14)]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the incidence of adverse events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules where the incidence was also greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety. Table 1 Incidence of Adverse Events in ESPS2Reported by ≥1% of patients during aspirin and dipyridamole extended-release capsuletreatment where the incidence was greater than in those treated with placebo.

Other Adverse Events Adverse reactions that occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in the ESPS2 study and that were medically judged to be possibly related to either dipyridamole or aspirin are listed below. Body as a Whole: Allergic reaction, fever Cardiovascular: Hypotension Central Nervous System: Coma, dizziness, paresthesia, cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage Gastrointestinal:Gastritis, ulceration and perforation Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: Tinnitus, and deafness. Patients with high frequency hearing loss may have difficulty perceiving tinnitus. In these patients, tinnitus cannot be used as a clinical indicator of salicylism Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitation, arrhythmia, supraventricular tachycardia Liver and Biliary System Disorders: Cholelithiasis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperglycemia, thirst Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: Hematoma, gingival bleeding Psychiatric Disorders: Agitation Reproductive: Uterine hemorrhage Respiratory: Hyperpnea, asthma, bronchospasm, hemoptysis, pulmonary edema Special Senses Other Disorders: Taste loss Skin and Appendages Disorders: Pruritus, urticaria Urogenital: Renal insufficiency and failure, hematuria Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders: Flushing Laboratory Changes Over the course of the 24-month study (ESPS2), patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules showed a decline (mean change from baseline) in hemoglobin of 0.25 g/dL, hematocrit of 0.75%, and erythrocyte count of 0.13x106/mm3. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Body as a Whole: Hypothermia, chest pain Cardiovascular: Angina pectoris Central Nervous System: Cerebral edema Fluid and Electrolyte: Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, hypokalemia Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, Reye syndrome, hematemesis Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: Hearing loss Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity, acute anaphylaxis, laryngeal edema Liver and Biliary System Disorders: Hepatitis, hepatic failure Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hypoglycemia, dehydration Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: Prolongation of the prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia Reproductive: Prolonged pregnancy and labor, stillbirths, lower birth weight infants, antepartum and postpartum bleeding Respiratory: Tachypnea, dyspnea Skin and Appendages Disorders: Rash, alopecia, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin hemorrhages such as bruising, ecchymosis, and hematoma Urogenital: Interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, proteinuria Vascular (Extracardiac Disorders): Allergic vasculitis Other Adverse Events: anorexia,aplastic anemia, migraine, pancytopenia, thrombocytosis."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules increase the risk of bleeding (5.1) •Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency (5.2, 5.3) •Can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, especially in the third trimester (5.4) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules increase the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]. Intracranial Hemorrhage In ESPS2 the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.6% in the aspirin and dipyridamole extended-release capsule group, 0.5% in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.4% in the aspirin (ASA) group and 0.4% in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2 the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 4.1% in the aspirin and dipyridamole extended-release capsule group, 2.2% in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 3.2% in the aspirin group, and 2.1% in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contain aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Pregnancy Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contain aspirin, aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth weight, increased incidence for intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, stillbirths and neonatal death. Because of the above and because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), avoid aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in the third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1½, 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat, the resorption rate approached 100%, indicating potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in pregnant women. If aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.6 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

Co-administration with anti-coagulants or NSAIDS can increase risk of bleeding (7.4, 7.10) Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDS (7.10) 7.1 Adenosine Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. 7.2 Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Due to the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. 7.3 Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. 7.4 Anticoagulant Therapy (heparin and warfarin) Patients on anticoagulation therapy are at increased risk for bleeding because of drug-drug interactions and effects on platelets. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. 7.5 Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. 7.6 Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. 7.7 Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. 7.8 Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. 7.9 Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. 7.10 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. 7.11 Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. 7.12 Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents."

Risk of Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or (800) 459-9906 TTY or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either AGGRENOX, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the incidence of adverse events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with AGGRENOX where the incidence was also greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The risk of GI bleeding is increased, especially in patients who are heavy alcohol users, have a history of peptic ulcer, or have coagulation abnormalities due to liver disease or vitamin K deficiency (5.1) As with other antiplatelets, there is a risk of intracranial hemorrhage (5.1) Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency (5.2, 5.3) Can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, especially in the third trimester (5.4) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Intracranial Hemorrhage In ESPS2 the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.6% in the AGGRENOX group, 0.5% in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.4% in the aspirin (ASA) group and 0.4% in the placebo groups. Coagulation Abnormalities Even low doses of aspirin can inhibit platelet function leading to an increase in bleeding time. This can adversely affect patients with inherited or acquired (liver disease or vitamin K deficiency) bleeding disorders [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2 the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 4.1% in the AGGRENOX group, 2.2% in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 3.2% in the aspirin group, and 2.1% in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4 Pregnancy Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin, AGGRENOX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth weight, increased incidence for intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, stillbirths and neonatal death. Because of the above and because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), avoid AGGRENOX in the third trimester of pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m2 basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of AGGRENOX. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1½, 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat, the resorption rate approached 100%, indicating potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of AGGRENOX in pregnant women. If AGGRENOX is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking AGGRENOX, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. 5.5 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.6 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.7 General AGGRENOX capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or NSAIDS can increase risk of bleeding (7.1) Decreased renal function can occur with co-administration with NSAIDS (7.1) 7.1 Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Adenosine Due to the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Acetazolamide Patients taking AGGRENOX in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. Anticonvulsants The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Beta Blockers Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis. Cholinesterase Inhibitors The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. Diuretics Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. Methotrexate The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypoglycemia. Oral Hypoglycemics Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents. Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone)"

The efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either AGGRENOX, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [ ]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. see Clinical Studies (14) This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the incidence of adverse events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with AGGRENOX where the incidence was also greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS AGGRENOX increases the risk of bleeding (5.1) Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency , (5.2 5.3) Can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, especially in the third trimester (5.4) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding AGGRENOX increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [ ]. see Drug Interactions (7.1) In ESPS2 the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.6% in the AGGRENOX group, 0.5% in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.4% in the aspirin (ASA) group and 0.4% in the placebo groups. Intracranial Hemorrhage GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects In ESPS2 the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 4.1% in the AGGRENOX group, 2.2% in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 3.2% in the aspirin group, and 2.1% in the placebo groups. Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Peptic Ulcer Disease Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. Alcohol Warning 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [ ]. see Use in Specific Populations and Clinical Pharmacology (8.6) (12.3) 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [ ]. see Use in Specific Populations and Clinical Pharmacology (8.6) (12.3) 5.4 Pregnancy Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin, AGGRENOX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth weight, increased incidence for intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, stillbirths and neonatal death. Because of the above and because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), avoid AGGRENOX in the third trimester of pregnancy [ ]. see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of AGGRENOX. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1½, 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat, the resorption rate approached 100%, indicating potentiation of aspirin-related fetal toxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of the use of AGGRENOX in pregnant women. If AGGRENOX is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking AGGRENOX, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. 2 2 5.5 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.6 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.7 General AGGRENOX capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets."
