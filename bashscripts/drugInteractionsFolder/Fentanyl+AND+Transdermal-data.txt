        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for an extended period of time and adjust dosage, if necessary. (7.1) Use CNS Depressants with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are receiving fentanyl transdermal system. (7.2) Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Closely monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the dosage of fentanyl transdermal system if warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. Monitor patients closely when central nervous system depressants are used concomitantly with fentanyl transdermal system and reduce the dose of one or both agents. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics.",

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal system may have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20 to 27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24 to 72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system (see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2),Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In postmarketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to inappropriate use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Premarketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) post-operative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in TABLE 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥ 1% are presented in TABLE 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal system may have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20 to 27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24 to 72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system (see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2),Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7.4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co-administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when SUBSYS is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of SUBSYS with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving SUBSYS concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. The concomitant use of SUBSYS with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of SUBSYS. Patients receiving SUBSYS who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored for signs of increased SUBSYS activity and the dose of SUBSYS should be adjusted accordingly. Concomitant use of SUBSYS with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions during treatment (frequency ≥5%): vomiting, nausea, constipation, dyspnea, and somnolence. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Insys Therapeutics, Inc., at 1-855-978-2797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/ medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of SUBSYS has been evaluated in a total of 359 opioid-tolerant patients with breakthrough cancer pain. The duration of SUBSYS use varied during the open-label study. Safety data from a long-term extension study showed that the average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 66 days. The maximum duration of therapy was 149 days. The dose range studied in these trials ranged from 100 mcg per dose to 1600 mcg per dose. The most commonly observed adverse reactions seen with SUBSYS are typical opioid side effects such as nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and constipation. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including SUBSYS are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of SUBSYS was nausea. There were also adverse reactions of abdominal distension, anorexia, confusional state, disorientation, somnolence, and constipation. The clinical trials of SUBSYS were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain; all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received SUBSYS for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. Table 3 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater that occurred during titration in the clinical trials.

Two of the nine subjects with mucositis (one with Grade 1 and one with Grade 2) reported a burning sensation in the oral mucosa after treatment. Both of these events were considered mild and probably related to treatment. There was no change in grade of mucositis after treatment for any subject."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) Full and consumed SUBSYS units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. (5.3, 16.2) Use with other CNS depressants and moderate or strong CYP450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate SUBSYS cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in SUBSYS. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing SUBSYS is not bioequivalent with other fentanyl products. Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from other fentanyl products. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute a SUBSYS prescription for any other fentanyl product. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of SUBSYS compared to other fentanyl products that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of the same dose of SUBSYS for the same dose of any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) All patients should be titrated from the 100 mcg dose. Titrate each patient individually to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that SUBSYS contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. All used units should be disposed of immediately after use as they represent a special risk to children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), Patient Counseling Information (17), and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. SUBSYS could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of SUBSYS with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of SUBSYS if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking SUBSYS of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate SUBSYS with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of SUBSYS may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer SUBSYS with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use SUBSYS with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors SUBSYS is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) ACCESS Program Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], SUBSYS is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the TIRF REMS ACCESS program. Under the TIRF REMS ACCESS program, outpatients, prescribers who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of SUBSYS, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS ACCESS program are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe SUBSYS must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS ACCESS program, enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. To receive SUBSYS, patients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense SUBSYS must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributors that distribute SUBSYS must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

        "Drug Interactions The interaction between ritonavir, a CPY3A4 inhibitor, and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg tid on Day 1 and 300 mg tid on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC0-∞. Coadministration of ritonavir in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system has not been studied; however, an increase in fentanyl AUC is expected (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore, potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarmone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information).",

The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥1% are presented in Table 1.

        "Drug Interactions Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadminstration with agents that induce 3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with ritonavir or other potent 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazadone may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations (see BOX WARNING, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Drug Interactions, WARNINGS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem and erythromycin with transdermal fentanyl may also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression. In this situation, special patient care and observation are appropriate. Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be significantly reduced. MAO Inhibitors Fentanyl transdermal system is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOI within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to inappropriate use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience: Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDIACTED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) post-operative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients studied. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for £15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ³1% are presented in Table 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with Fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of Fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7.4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid Fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of Fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and Fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with Fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with Fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of Fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of Fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving Fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when Fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Accidental Exposure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hypotensive Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) are nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, anorexia, headache, and diarrhea. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, call 1-855-899-9180 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience The safety of Fentanyl transdermal system was evaluated in 216 patients who took at least one dose of Fentanyl transdermal system in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Fentanyl transdermal system. This trial examined patients over 40 years of age with severe pain induced by osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and who were in need of and waiting for joint replacement. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with severe pain were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, and anorexia. Other common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in clinical trials in patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain were headache and diarrhea. Adverse reactions reported for ≥1% of Fentanyl transdermal system-treated patients and with an incidence greater than placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 3. The most common adverse reactions that were associated with discontinuation in patients with pain (causing discontinuation in ≥1% of patients) were depression, dizziness, somnolence, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co-administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] . As modified-release products such as Fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving Fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of Fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as Fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of Fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)] . Opioid agonists such as Fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)] . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with Fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Overestimating the Fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to Fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in Fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to Fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing Fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of Fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to Fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)] . 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of Fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if Fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of Fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin Fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Fentanyl transdermal system and when Fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of Fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of Fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Fentanyl transdermal system, as Fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of Fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of Fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of Fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving Fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating Fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the Fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Warn patients to avoid exposing the Fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing Fentanyl transdermal system systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the Fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing Fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with Fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with Fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as Fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of Fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of Fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of Fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as Fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of Fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of Fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of Fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including Fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the Fentanyl transdermal system."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial opioid analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7.4) •Monamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving central nervous system depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects area achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergis or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

This trial examined patients over 40 years of age with severe pain induced by osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and who were in need of and waiting for joint replacement. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with severe pain were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, and anorexia. Other common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in clinical trials in patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain were headache and diarrhea. Adverse reactions reported for ≥1% of fentanyl transdermal system-treated patients and with an incidence greater than placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 3.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Interaction with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If coadministration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive pharmacological effects. (5.5) •Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because increased risk of life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) •Hypotensive effect: Monitor during dose initiation and titration (5.9) •Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention (5.8) •Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any one individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse and misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal history or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system; but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system, along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispending fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatat respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrests and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of therapy or following dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system (see Dosage and Administration (2.4)(2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2). 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl, and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "Drug Interactions Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadminstration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time, and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Drug Interactions, WARNINGS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information). Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be significantly reduced. MAO Inhibitors Fentanyl transdermal system is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOI within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) post-operative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2–18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16–30 days; 16% for 31–60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥1% are presented in Table 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7.4) •Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co- administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) •Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) •Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) •Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) •Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (i.e., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (i.e., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (i.e., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Closely monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the dosage of fentanyl transdermal system if warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. Monitor patients closely when central nervous system depressants are used concomitantly with fentanyl transdermal system and reduce the dose of one or both agents. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics.",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal system may have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20 to 27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24 to 72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system (see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2),Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) 7.1 Metabolic Drug Interactions Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when Lazanda is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. CYP3A4 inhibitors The concomitant use of Lazanda with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving Lazanda who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors are to be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Increase dose conservatively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. CYP3A4 inducers The concomitant use of Lazanda with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of Lazanda. Patients receiving Lazanda who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers may experience sudden increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and are to be monitored for signs of increased Lazanda activity. Adjust the dose of Lazanda accordingly. 7.2 Non-metabolic Drug Interactions Agents used to treat Allergic Rhinitis The presence of allergic rhinitis is not expected to affect Lazanda absorption. However, co-administration of a vasoconstrictive nasal decongestant such as oxymetazoline to treat allergic rhinitis leads to lower peak plasma concentrations and a delayed Tmax of fentanyl that may cause Lazanda to be less effective in patients with allergic rhinitis who use such decongestants, thus potentially impairing pain management. Additionally, in view of the possibility that the titration of a patient while they are experiencing an acute episode of rhinitis could lead to incorrect dose identification (particularly if they are using a vasoconstrictive decongestant), titration under these circumstances must be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. MAO inhibitor Concomitant use of Lazanda with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuing an MAO inhibitor, is not recommended."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): vomiting, nausea, dizziness, pyrexia, and constipation. [6.1] To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Archimedes Pharma at 1-866-435-6775 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Lazanda has been evaluated in a total of 523 opioid-tolerant patients with breakthrough cancer pain. The average duration of therapy in patients in the long-term study was 73 days, with 153 patients being treated for over 3 months. Patients continuing into the open-label extension period of the safety study have been treated for up to 26 months. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with Lazanda are typical of opioid side effects, such as nausea, constipation, somnolence, and headache. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The clinical trials of Lazanda were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain; all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone, or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 1 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received Lazanda for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of Lazanda therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse events are included regardless of causality or severity. Table 1 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign Lazanda a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. [5.1] Do not convert patients to Lazanda from other fentanyl products on a mcg per mcg basis, or substitute a Lazanda prescription for another fentanyl product, such substitution may result in fatal overdose. [5.2] Lazanda bottles contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. [5.3, 16.2, 16.3] Use with other CNS depressants and potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. [5.2, 5.4] Titrate Lazanda cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. [5.2, 5.6, 5.7] 5.1 Respiratory Depression Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using Lazanda. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Lazanda and other Fentanyl Products Lazanda is NOT equivalent to other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of Lazanda relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing Lazanda to a patient, DO NOT convert from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to Lazanda from other fentanyl products are not currently available. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl). Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of Lazanda is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] When dispensing Lazanda to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Information for Patients and Their Caregivers Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that Lazanda contains medicine in an amount that could be fatal to a child. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused bottles in their child-resistant container and out of the reach of children at all times. Partially used bottles represent a special risk to children. As soon as they are no longer required, all used, unopened or partially used bottles must be completely emptied of accessible fentanyl solution by spraying the remaining contents into the carbon-lined pouch. The sealed pouch and the empty bottle should be put into the child-resistant container before discarding in the trash. Hands must be washed with soap and water immediately after handling the pouch. [see Storage and Handling (16.2) , Disposal of Lazanda (16.3) , and Patient/Caregiver Instructions (17.1) ]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must question patients and caregivers specifically about the presence of children in the home on a full-time or visiting basis and counsel accordingly regarding the dangers to children of inadvertent exposure to Lazanda. Lazanda could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of Lazanda with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Metabolic Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and may require adjustment of the dose of Lazanda. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking Lazanda of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, cautiously adjust the dose of Lazanda in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of Lazanda may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer Lazanda with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; only use opioids if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Use Lazanda with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors Lazanda is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. [see Non-metabolic Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ], Lazanda is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of Lazanda, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe Lazanda must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive Lazanda, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense Lazanda must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributers that distribute Lazanda must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.tirfremsaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

        "Drug Interactions The interaction between ritonavir, a CPY3A4 inhibitor, and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg tid on Day 1 and 300 mg tid on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC0-∞. Coadministration of ritonavir in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system has not been studied; however, an increase in fentanyl AUC is expected (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore, potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarmone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) postoperative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥1% are presented in Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNINGS: IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION and POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1, 5.4) Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from another fentanyl product to ABSTRAL. (5.2) ABSTRAL contains fentanyl in a dose that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. (5.3, 16.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4, 7) Titrate ABSTRAL cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation, and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Hypoventilation (Respiratory Depression) Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using ABSTRAL. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses, including ABSTRAL, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 ABSTRAL and Other Fentanyl Products) ABSTRAL is NOT equivalent to all other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of ABSTRAL relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT convert from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to ABSTRAL from other fentanyl products are not currently available. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl). Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of ABSTRAL is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)] When dispensing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that ABSTRAL contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Even though ABSTRAL is provided in child-resistant packaging, patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep tablets out of the reach of children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1, 17.2)]. Taking ABSTRAL could be fatal in individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and the dose of ABSTRAL adjusted, if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking ABSTRAL of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause hypoventilation, titrate ABSTRAL with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of ABSTRAL may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer ABSTRAL with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; use only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous administration of fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use ABSTRAL with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors ABSTRAL is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within the past 14 days. Severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], ABSTRAL is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of ABSTRAL, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe ABSTRAL must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive ABSTRAL, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense ABSTRAL must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributors that distribute ABSTRAL must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

        "Drug Interactions Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fasamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time, and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Drug Interactions , WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information). Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be significantly reduced. MAO Inhibitors Fentanyl transdermal system is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOI within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to inappropriate use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pre-marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) post-operative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naïve patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥ 1% are presented in Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal system may have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20-27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24-72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for an extended period of time and adjust dosage, if necessary. (7.1) Use CNS Depressants with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are receiving fentanyl transdermal system. (7.2) Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Closely monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the dosage of fentanyl transdermal system if warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. Monitor patients closely when central nervous system depressants are used concomitantly with fentanyl transdermal system and reduce the dose of one or both agents. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal system may have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20-27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24-72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION 7.1 Central Nervous System DepressantsThe concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 IsoenzymesInhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO InhibitorsAvoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid AnalgesicsMixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 AnticholinergicsAnticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Accidental Exposure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hypotensive Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. 6.1 Clinical Trial ExperienceThe safety of fentanyl transdermal system was evaluated in 216 patients who took at least one dose of fentanyl transdermal system in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of fentanyl transdermal system. This trial examined patients over 40 years of age with severe pain induced by osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and who were in need of and waiting for joint replacement. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with severe pain were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, and anorexia. Other common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in clinical trials in patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain were headache and diarrhea.

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING, RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, ACCIDENTAL EXPOSURE, NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; and EXPOSURE TO HEATAddiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing Fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Life-threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of fentanyl transdermal system, even when used as recommended. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of fentanyl transdermal system or following a dose increase. Because of the risk of respiratory depression, fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use as an as-needed analgesic, in non-opioid tolerant patients, in acute pain, and in postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Accidental Exposure Deaths due to a fatal overdose of fentanyl have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions is of the utmost importance to prevent accidental exposure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Exposure To Heat Exposure of the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, heat or tanning lamps, sunbathing, hot baths, saunas, hot tubs, and heated water beds may increase fentanyl absorption and has resulted in fatal overdose of fentanyl and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever or increased core body temperature due to strenuous exertion are also at risk for increased fentanyl exposure and may require an adjustment in the dose of fentanyl transdermal system to avoid overdose and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].",

        "Drug Interactions The interaction between ritonavir, a CPY3A4 inhibitor, and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg tid on Day 1 and 300 mg tid on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC0-∞. Coadministration of ritonavir in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system has not been studied; however, an increase in fentanyl AUC is expected (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore, potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarmone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) postoperative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥1% are presented in Table 1.

(7.1) Use CNS Depressants with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are receiving fentanyl transdermal system. (7.2) Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Closely monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the dosage of fentanyl transdermal system if warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. Monitor patients closely when central nervous system depressants are used concomitantly with fentanyl transdermal system and reduce the dose of one or both agents. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics.",

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal system may have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20 to 27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24 to 72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system (see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2),Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions. (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mallinckrodt Inc., at 1-800-778-7898 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system. Table 1.

Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning – WARNING: RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) Full and partially consumed oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is NOT a generic version of Fentora® (fentanyl citrate buccal tablet). When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3) and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals, who prescribe oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributors, that distribute oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

(7.1) Use CNS Depressants with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are receiving fentanyl transdermal system. (7.2) Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Closely monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the dosage of fentanyl transdermal system if warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. Monitor patients closely when central nervous system depressants are used concomitantly with fentanyl transdermal system and reduce the dose of one or both agents. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal systemmay have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20 to 27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24 to 72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions The interaction between ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg tid on Day 1 and 300 mg tid on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC0-∞. Coadministration of ritonavir in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system has not been studied; however, an increase in fentanyl AUC is expected (see BOX WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore, potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadminstration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazodone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) post-operative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1 ; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥1% are presented in Table 1 .

(7.2) Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Closely monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the dosage of fentanyl transdermal system if warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. Monitor patients closely when central nervous system depressants are used concomitantly with fentanyl transdermal system and reduce the dose of one or both agents. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal system may have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20-27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24-72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. •See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cephalon, Inc., at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of OTFC use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with OTFC are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of OTFC, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including OTFC are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of OTFC were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received OTFC for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of OTFC therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of OTFC that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING: RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL •Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) •Full and partially consumed OTFC units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“OTFC Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) •Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) •Titrate OTFC cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6. 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC). Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of Fentora®. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that OTFC contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3) and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )] , OTFC is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of OTFC, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: • Healthcare professionals, who prescribe OTFC for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. • To receive OTFC, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. • Pharmacies that dispense OTFC must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. • Wholesalers and distributors that distribute OTFC must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to OTFC . The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of OTFC (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING: RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL •Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.2) •Full and partially consumed Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“OTFC Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) •Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) •Titrate OTFC cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in ACTIQ. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora ®). When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) prescription under any circumstances. Fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage And Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage And Handling, (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.3) and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [ see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9)], OTFC is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration, (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of OTFC, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access Program are: •Healthcare professionals, who prescribe OTFC for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access Program, enroll in the program, and commit to comply with the REMS requirements. •To receive OTFC, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits of the drug and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. •Pharmacies, that dispense OTFC, must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. •Wholesalers and distributors, that distribute OTFC must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized enrolled pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822 1483."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for an extended period of time and adjust dosage, if necessary. (7.1) Use CNS Depressants with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are receiving fentanyl transdermal system. (7.2) Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Closely monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the dosage of fentanyl transdermal system if warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. Monitor patients closely when central nervous system depressants are used concomitantly with fentanyl transdermal system and reduce the dose of one or both agents. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal system may have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20-27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24-72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for an extended period of time and adjust dosage, if necessary. (7.1) Use CNS Depressants with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are receiving fentanyl transdermal system. (7.2) Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Closely monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the dosage of fentanyl transdermal system if warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. Monitor patients closely when central nervous system depressants are used concomitantly with fentanyl transdermal system and reduce the dose of one or both agents. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal systemmay have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20 to 27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24 to 72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal systemmay have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20 to 27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24 to 72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "Drug Interactions The interaction between ritonavir, a CPY3A4 inhibitor, and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg tid on Day 1 and 300 mg tid on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC0-∞. Coadministration of ritonavir in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system has not been studied; however, an increase in fentanyl AUC is expected (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore, potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarmone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) postoperative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥1% are presented in Table 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7. 4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.",

This trial examined patients over 40 years of age with severe pain induced by osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and who were in need of and waiting for joint replacement. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with severe pain were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, and anorexia. Other common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in clinical trials in patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain were headache and diarrhea. Adverse reactions reported for ≥1% of fentanyl transdermal system-treated patients and with an incidence greater than placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 3.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co-administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. . 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when OTFC is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [ see Warnings And Precautions (5.9)]. •See Boxed Warning and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash and insomnia. ( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical at 1-800-828-9393 option 2 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of OTFC use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with OTFC are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of OTFC, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including OTFC are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of OTFC were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received OTFC for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of OTFC therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of OTFC that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system. Table 1.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of OTFC (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING: RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL •Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.2) •Full and partially consumed Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“OTFC Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) •Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) •Titrate OTFC cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in ACTIQ. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora ®). When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) prescription under any circumstances. Fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage And Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage And Handling, (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.3) and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [ see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9)], OTFC is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration, (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of OTFC, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access Program are: •Healthcare professionals, who prescribe OTFC for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access Program, enroll in the program, and commit to comply with the REMS requirements. •To receive OTFC, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits of the drug and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. •Pharmacies, that dispense OTFC, must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. •Wholesalers and distributors, that distribute OTFC must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized enrolled pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822 1483."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7. 4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.",

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co-administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. . 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human CYP3A4 isoenzyme system; therefore potential interactions may occur when FENTORA is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of FENTORA with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving FENTORA who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done cautiously [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The concomitant use of FENTORA with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of FENTORA. Patients receiving FENTORA who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored for signs of increased FENTORA activity and the dose of FENTORA should be adjusted accordingly. See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions. (5.4, 7)"

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals, at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of FENTORA has been evaluated in 304 opioid-tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. The average duration of therapy was 76 days with some patients being treated for over 12 months. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with FENTORA are typical of opioid side effects. Opioid side effects should be expected and managed accordingly. The clinical trials of FENTORA were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received FENTORA for breakthrough pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of FENTORA therapy or cancer-related symptoms. Table 2 lists, by maximum dose received, adverse events with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Table 2.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) Fentora is not bioequivalent to other fentanyl products. Do not convert from other fentanyl products on a mcg per mcg basis. (5.2) Use with other CNS depressants and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate FENTORA cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) Application site reactions occurred in 10% of patients in clinical trials and ranged from paresthesia to ulceration and bleeding. (5.8) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in FENTORA. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing FENTORA is not bioequivalent with other fentanyl products. Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from other fentanyl products. There are no conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products other than Actiq. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) For patients being converted from Actiq, it is necessary to follow the instructions found in Table 1 in Section 2.1,.as Actiq and FENTORA are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. FENTORA is NOT a generic version of Actiq. All patients should be titrated from the 100 mcg dose. The initial dose of FENTORA should be 100 mcg. Titrate each patient individually to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] When dispensing, DO NOT substitute a FENTORA prescription for an Actiq prescription under any circumstances. FENTORA and Actiq are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of FENTORA compared to other fentanyl products including Actiq that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of the same dose of FENTORA for the same dose of Actiq or any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that FENTORA contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep tablets out of the reach of children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1) ] 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of FENTORA with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of FENTORA if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking FENTORA of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate FENTORA with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of FENTORA may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer FENTORA with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Application Site Reactions In clinical trials, 10% of all patients exposed to FENTORA reported application site reactions. These reactions ranged from paresthesia to ulceration and bleeding. Application site reactions occurring in ≥1% of patients were pain (4%), ulcer (3%), and irritation (3%). Application site reactions tended to occur early in treatment, were self-limited and only resulted in treatment discontinuation for 2% of patients. 5.9 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use FENTORA with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.10 MAO Inhibitors FENTORA is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.11 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] , FENTORA is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of FENTORA, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals, who prescribe FENTORA for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive FENTORA, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense FENTORA must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributors that distribute FENTORA must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when ACTIQ is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of ACTIQ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving ACTIQ concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of ACTIQ with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. •See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cephalon, Inc., at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of ACTIQ has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of ACTIQ use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with ACTIQ are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of ACTIQ, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including ACTIQ are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of ACTIQ were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received ACTIQ for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of ACTIQ therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of ACTIQ that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system. Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING:RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL •Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) •Full and partially consumed ACTIQ units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“ACTIQ Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) •Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) •Titrate ACTIQ cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in ACTIQ. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to ACTIQ from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as ACTIQ and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. ACTIQ is NOT a generic version of Fentora®. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an ACTIQ prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and ACTIQ are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of ACTIQ compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of ACTIQ for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of ACTIQ should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that ACTIQ contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested ACTIQ. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3), and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. ACTIQ could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of ACTIQ with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of ACTIQ if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking ACTIQ of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate ACTIQ with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of ACTIQ may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer ACTIQ with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use ACTIQ with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors ACTIQ is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] , ACTIQ is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program.Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of ACTIQ, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: • Healthcare professionals, who prescribe ACTIQ for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. • To receive ACTIQ, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. • Pharmacies that dispense ACTIQ must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. • Wholesalers and distributors that distribute ACTIQ must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7. 4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.",

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co-administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. . 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system.",

        "Drug Interactions The interaction between ritonavir, a CPY3A4 inhibitor, and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg tid on Day 1 and 300 mg tid on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC0-∞. Coadministration of ritonavir in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system has not been studied; however, an increase in fentanyl AUC is expected (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore, potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarmone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) postoperative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥1% are presented in Table 1.

(7.1) Use CNS Depressants with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are receiving fentanyl transdermal system. (7.2) Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Closely monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the dosage of fentanyl transdermal system if warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. Monitor patients closely when central nervous system depressants are used concomitantly with fentanyl transdermal system and reduce the dose of one or both agents. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) Fentanyl transdermal system may have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20-27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24-72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fasamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time, and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Drug Interactions , WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information).

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to inappropriate use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pre-marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) post-operative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naïve patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥ 1% are presented in Table 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) 7.1 Metabolic Drug Interactions Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when Lazanda is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. CYP3A4 inhibitors The concomitant use of Lazanda with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving Lazanda who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors are to be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Increase dose conservatively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. CYP3A4 inducers The concomitant use of Lazanda with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of Lazanda. Patients receiving Lazanda who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers may experience sudden increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and are to be monitored for signs of increased Lazanda activity. Adjust the dose of Lazanda accordingly. 7.2 Non-metabolic Drug Interactions Agents used to treat Allergic Rhinitis The presence of allergic rhinitis is not expected to affect Lazanda absorption. However, co-administration of a vasoconstrictive nasal decongestant such as oxymetazoline to treat allergic rhinitis leads to lower peak plasma concentrations and a delayed Tmax of fentanyl that may cause Lazanda to be less effective in patients with allergic rhinitis who use such decongestants, thus potentially impairing pain management. Additionally, in view of the possibility that the titration of a patient while they are experiencing an acute episode of rhinitis could lead to incorrect dose identification (particularly if they are using a vasoconstrictive decongestant), titration under these circumstances must be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. MAO inhibitor Concomitant use of Lazanda with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuing an MAO inhibitor, is not recommended."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): vomiting, nausea, dizziness, pyrexia, and constipation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Depomed, Inc. at 1-866-458-6389 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Lazanda has been evaluated in a total of 523 opioid-tolerant patients with breakthrough cancer pain. The average duration of therapy in patients in the long-term study was 73 days, with 153 patients being treated for over 3 months. Patients continuing into the open-label extension period of the safety study have been treated for up to 26 months. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with Lazanda are typical of opioid side effects, such as nausea, constipation, somnolence, and headache. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The clinical trials of Lazanda were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain; all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone, or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 1 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received Lazanda for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of Lazanda therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse events are included regardless of causality or severity. Table 1 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign Lazanda a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) Do not convert patients to Lazanda from other fentanyl products on a mcg per mcg basis, or substitute a Lazanda prescription for another fentanyl product, such substitution may result in fatal overdose. (5.2) Lazanda bottles contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. (5.3, 16.2, 16.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.2, 5.4) Titrate Lazanda cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.2, 5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using Lazanda. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Lazanda and other Fentanyl Products Lazanda is NOT equivalent to other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of Lazanda relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing Lazanda to a patient, DO NOT convert from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to Lazanda from other fentanyl products are not currently available. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl). Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of Lazanda is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] When dispensing Lazanda to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Information for Patients and Their Caregivers Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that Lazanda contains medicine in an amount that could be fatal to a child. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused bottles in their child-resistant container and out of the reach of children at all times. Partially used bottles represent a special risk to children. As soon as they are no longer required, all used, unopened or partially used bottles must be completely emptied of accessible fentanyl solution by spraying the remaining contents into the carbon-lined pouch. The sealed pouch and the empty bottle should be put into the child-resistant container before discarding in the trash. Hands must be washed with soap and water immediately after handling the pouch. [see Storage and Handling (16.2) , Disposal of Lazanda (16.3) , and Patient/Caregiver Instructions (17) ]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must question patients and caregivers specifically about the presence of children in the home on a full-time or visiting basis and counsel accordingly regarding the dangers to children of inadvertent exposure to Lazanda. Lazanda could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of Lazanda with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Metabolic Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and may require adjustment of the dose of Lazanda. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking Lazanda of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, cautiously adjust the dose of Lazanda in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of Lazanda may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer Lazanda with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; only use opioids if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Use Lazanda with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors Lazanda is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. [see Non-metabolic Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ], Lazanda is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of Lazanda, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe Lazanda must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive Lazanda, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense Lazanda must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributers that distribute Lazanda must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.tirfremsaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with Fentanyl Transdermal System because they may reduce analgesic effect of Fentanyl Transdermal System or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7. 4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of Fentanyl Transdermal System with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and Fentanyl Transdermal System for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with Fentanyl Transdermal System is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with Fentanyl Transdermal System is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of Fentanyl Transdermal System or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving Fentanyl Transdermal System. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when Fentanyl Transdermal System is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Accidental Exposure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hypotensive Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) are nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, anorexia, headache, and diarrhea. (6.) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, call 1-800-526-7736 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience The safety of Fentanyl Transdermal System was evaluated in 216 patients who took at least one dose of Fentanyl Transdermal System in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Fentanyl Transdermal System. This trial examined patients over 40 years of age with severe pain induced by osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and who were in need of and waiting for joint replacement. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with severe pain were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, and anorexia. Other common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in clinical trials in patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain were headache and diarrhea. Adverse reactions reported for ≥1% of Fentanyl Transdermal System-treated patients and with an incidence greater than placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 3.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co-administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl Transdermal System contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Fentanyl Transdermal System exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as Fentanyl Transdermal System deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Fentanyl Transdermal System and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Fentanyl Transdermal System, and monitor all patients receiving Fentanyl Transdermal System for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of Fentanyl Transdermal System for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as Fentanyl Transdermal System, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Fentanyl Transdermal System along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of Fentanyl Transdermal System by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as Fentanyl Transdermal System are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Fentanyl Transdermal System. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl Transdermal System is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Fentanyl Transdermal System, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with Fentanyl Transdermal System. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Fentanyl Transdermal System are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the Fentanyl Transdermal System dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to Fentanyl Transdermal System, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in Fentanyl Transdermal System even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to Fentanyl Transdermal System. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing Fentanyl Transdermal System in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of Fentanyl Transdermal System in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to Fentanyl Transdermal System [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of Fentanyl Transdermal System during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if Fentanyl Transdermal System is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin Fentanyl Transdermal System is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Fentanyl Transdermal System and when Fentanyl Transdermal System is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Fentanyl Transdermal System, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of Fentanyl Transdermal System may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Fentanyl Transdermal System, as Fentanyl Transdermal System may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl Transdermal System may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of Fentanyl Transdermal System. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of Fentanyl Transdermal System, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of Fentanyl Transdermal System with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving Fentanyl Transdermal System and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating Fentanyl Transdermal System treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the Fentanyl Transdermal System increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the Fentanyl Transdermal System application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing Fentanyl Transdermal System systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the Fentanyl Transdermal System dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing Fentanyl Transdermal System to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl Transdermal System may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with Fentanyl Transdermal System. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as Fentanyl Transdermal System and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of Fentanyl Transdermal System. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as Fentanyl Transdermal System, avoid the use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of Fentanyl Transdermal System. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl Transdermal System may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl Transdermal System may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including Fentanyl Transdermal System. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the Fentanyl Transdermal System."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7. 4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.",

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co-administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. . 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system.",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If coadministration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

      "drug_interactions": [
        "Drug Interactions The interaction between ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg tid on Day 1 and 300 mg tid on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC0-∞. Coadministration of ritonavir in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system has not been studied; however, an increase in fentanyl AUC is expected (see BOX WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore, potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadminstration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazodone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) post-operative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1 ; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥1% are presented in Table 1 .

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. ( , ) • 5.1 7.4 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. ( ) • 7.3 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced . [see and ] Dosage and Administration (2.2) Warnings and Precautions (5.5) 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved . [see ] Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved . [see ] Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression . [see ] Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

This trial examined patients over 40 years of age with severe pain induced by osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and who were in need of and waiting for joint replacement. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with severe pain were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, and anorexia. Other common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) reported in clinical trials in patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain were headache and diarrhea. Adverse reactions reported for ≥ 1% of fentanyl transdermal system-treated patients and with an incidence greater than placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 3. The most common adverse reactions that were associated with discontinuation in patients with pain (causing discontinuation in ≥ 1% of patients) were depression, dizziness, somnolence, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co- administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. ( ) • 5.5 Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. ( , ) • 5.6 5.7 Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. ( ) • 5.9 Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO retention. ( ) • 2 5.8 Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. ( ) • 5.13 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse . As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. [see ] Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (i.e., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death . [see ] Overdosage (10) Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. [see ] Patient Counseling Information (17) 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. [see ] Overdosage (10) Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential . Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. [see ] Dosage and Administration (2) Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system . [see , ] Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5) 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (i.e., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant . [see ] Drug Interactions (7.1) 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration . [see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.2) 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea . Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. [see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.2) 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma . In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 2 [see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.2) 2 2 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (i.e., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. [see ] Drug Interactions (7.1) 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved . [see , and ] Drug Interactions (7.2) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure . [see ] Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources . [see ] Dosage and Administration (2.3) 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase . [see , and ] Dosing and Administration (2.2) Use in Specific Populations (8.6) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase . [see , and ] Dosing and Administration (2.2) Use in Specific Populations (8.7) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience The safety of fentanyl buccal tablets has been evaluated in 304 opioid tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. The average duration of therapy was 76 days with some patients being treated for over 12 months. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with fentanyl buccal tablets are typical of opioid side effects. Opioid side effects should be expected and managed accordingly. The clinical trials of fentanyl buccal tablets were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received fentanyl buccal tablets for breakthrough pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of fentanyl buccal tablets therapy or cancer-related symptoms. Table 5 lists, by maximum dose received, adverse events with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Table 5.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS •Monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for an extended period of time and adjust dosage, if necessary. (7.1) •Use CNS Depressants with caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are receiving fentanyl transdermal system. (7.2) •Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4). Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, or grapefruit juice) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Closely monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor and reduce the dosage of fentanyl transdermal system if warranted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (i.e., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. Monitor patients closely when central nervous system depressants are used concomitantly with fentanyl transdermal system and reduce the dose of one or both agents. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused. Use caution when prescribing if there is an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. (5.1) •Fatal respiratory depression can occur with fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients accordingly. Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of respiratory depression. (5.2) •Accidental exposure of fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3) •Use fentanyl transdermal system with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6) •Fentanyl transdermal system may have additive effects when used in conjunction with other CNS depressants, alcohol, and drugs of abuse. (5.7) •Use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations. Monitor patients accordingly and adjust dosage if necessary. (5.8) •Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.11) •Use fentanyl transdermal system with caution in patients with pancreatic/biliary disease. (5.14) 5.1 Abuse Potential Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid analgesics. Schedule II opioid substances which include hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, oxymorphone and methadone have the highest potential for abuse and risk of fatal overdose due to respiratory depression. Fentanyl transdermal system can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. These risks should be considered when administering, prescribing, or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system in situations where the healthcare professional is concerned about increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Assess patients for their clinical risks for opioid abuse or addiction prior to being prescribed opioids. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Persons at increased risk for opioid abuse include those with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (i.e., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with modified-release opioid formulations; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression and Death Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Fentanyl transdermal system has a narrow indication and should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the administration of potent opioids and management of chronic pain [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated for use in conditions in which the risk of life threatening respiratory depression is significantly increased, including use as an as-needed analgesic, use in non-opioid tolerant patients, acute pain, and postoperative pain [see Contraindications (4)]. Proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid medication, can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. However, respiratory depression has also been reported with use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who are opioid-tolerant, even when fentanyl transdermal system has been used as recommended and not misused or abused. The mean half-life of fentanyl when delivered by fentanyl transdermal system is approximately 20 to 27 hours. Serum fentanyl concentrations continue to rise for the first two system applications. In addition, significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life threatening or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the potential for serious, life threatening, or fatal respiratory depression is greatest during the first two applications following initiation of dosing, or following an increase in dosage. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, especially within the initial 24 to 72 hours when serum concentrations from the initial patch will peak, and following increases in dosage. Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 24 hours or more after the patch is removed, respiratory depression may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Monitor patients for respiratory depression after patch removal to ensure that the patient’s respiration has stabilized for at least 24 to 72 hours or longer as clinical symptoms dictate. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdose (10.2)]. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that could result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system (see Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5)]. 5.4 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics due to poor fat stores, muscle wasting, or altered clearance. Therefore, monitor these patients closely, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system and when given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.6 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.7 Interactions with Other CNS Depressants, Alcohol, and Drugs of Abuse The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including, but not limited to, other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (i.e., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma. Monitor patients prescribed concomitant CNS active drugs for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, and reduce the dose of one or both agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.9 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.11 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.12 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2),Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.13 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.14 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.15 Avoidance of Withdrawal Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion to another opioid or when decreasing or discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system. Gradual reduction of the dose of fentanyl transdermal system is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. 5.16 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Premarketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in postoperative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 postoperative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) postoperative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 postoperative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥ 1% are presented in Table 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when OTFC is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings And Precautions (5.9)]. Monitor patients who begin or end therapy with potent inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 for signs of opioid toxicity. (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Enter section text here Most common adverse reactions during titration phase (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache. (6.1) Most common adverse reactions during treatment (frequency ≥5%): dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cephalon, Inc., at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of OTFC (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate) has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of OTFC use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with OTFC are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of OTFC, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including OTFC are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of OTFC were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received OTFC for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of OTFC therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of OTFC that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system. Table 1.

Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to OTFC. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OTFC (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING: IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION, DOSING, and POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.2) Full and partially consumed OTFC units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“OTFC Child Safety Kit”) (5.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate OTFC cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. (5.6) Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.7) 5.1 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of Fentora®. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage And Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Respiratory Depression As with all opioids, there is a risk of clinically significant respiratory depression in patients using OTFC. Accordingly, follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Respiratory depression may occur more readily when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that OTFC contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage And Handling (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) and the Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

        "Drug Interactions Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfanivir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fasamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time, and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Drug Interactions , WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information). Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be significantly reduced. MAO Inhibitors Fentanyl transdermal system is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOI within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to inappropriate use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pre-marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) post-operative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naïve patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥ 1% are presented in Table 1.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION 7.1 Central Nervous System DepressantsThe concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 IsoenzymesInhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO InhibitorsAvoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid AnalgesicsMixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 AnticholinergicsAnticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Accidental Exposure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hypotensive Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. 6.1 Clinical Trial ExperienceThe safety of fentanyl transdermal system was evaluated in 216 patients who took at least one dose of fentanyl transdermal system in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of fentanyl transdermal system. This trial examined patients over 40 years of age with severe pain induced by osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and who were in need of and waiting for joint replacement. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with severe pain were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, and anorexia. Other common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in clinical trials in patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain were headache and diarrhea. Adverse reactions reported for ≥1% of fentanyl transdermal system-treated patients and with an incidence greater than placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 3. The most common adverse reactions that were associated with discontinuation in patients with pain (causing discontinuation in ≥1% of patients) were depression, dizziness, somnolence, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and MisuseFentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory DepressionSerious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental ExposureA considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal SyndromeProlonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System DepressantsHypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated PatientsLife-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary DiseaseMonitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial PressureAvoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive EffectsFentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and InducersSince the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External HeatExposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with FeverBased on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal system who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac DiseaseFentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic ImpairmentA clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Renal ImpairmentA clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract DiseaseFentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of WithdrawalAvoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating MachineryStrong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "Drug Interactions Agents Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzyme System Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fasamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time, and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING; CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug Interactions; WARNINGS; and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information). Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be significantly reduced. MAO Inhibitors Fentanyl transdermal system is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOI within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In postmarketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to inappropriate use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Premarketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) post-operative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in TABLE 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥ 1% are presented in TABLE 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with Fentanyl Transdermal System because they may reduce analgesic effect of Fentanyl Transdermal System or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7. 4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of Fentanyl Transdermal System with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and Fentanyl Transdermal System for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with Fentanyl Transdermal System is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with Fentanyl Transdermal System is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of Fentanyl Transdermal System or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving Fentanyl Transdermal System. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when Fentanyl Transdermal System is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Accidental Exposure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hypotensive Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Most common adverse reactions (≥5%) are nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, anorexia, headache, and diarrhea. (6.) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, call 1-866-517-8839 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience The safety of Fentanyl Transdermal System was evaluated in 216 patients who took at least one dose of Fentanyl Transdermal System in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Fentanyl Transdermal System. This trial examined patients over 40 years of age with severe pain induced by osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and who were in need of and waiting for joint replacement. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with severe pain were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, and anorexia. Other common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in clinical trials in patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain were headache and diarrhea. Adverse reactions reported for ≥1% of Fentanyl Transdermal System-treated patients and with an incidence greater than placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 3. The most common adverse reactions that were associated with discontinuation in patients with pain (causing discontinuation in ≥1% of patients) were depression, dizziness, somnolence, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co-administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl Transdermal System contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Fentanyl Transdermal System exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as Fentanyl Transdermal System deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Fentanyl Transdermal System and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Fentanyl Transdermal System, and monitor all patients receiving Fentanyl Transdermal System for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of Fentanyl Transdermal System for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as Fentanyl Transdermal System, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Fentanyl Transdermal System along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of Fentanyl Transdermal System by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as Fentanyl Transdermal System are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Fentanyl Transdermal System. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl Transdermal System is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Fentanyl Transdermal System, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with Fentanyl Transdermal System. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Fentanyl Transdermal System are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the Fentanyl Transdermal System dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to Fentanyl Transdermal System, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in Fentanyl Transdermal System even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to Fentanyl Transdermal System. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing Fentanyl Transdermal System in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of Fentanyl Transdermal System in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to Fentanyl Transdermal System [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of Fentanyl Transdermal System during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if Fentanyl Transdermal System is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin Fentanyl Transdermal System is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Fentanyl Transdermal System and when Fentanyl Transdermal System is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Fentanyl Transdermal System, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of Fentanyl Transdermal System may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Fentanyl Transdermal System, as Fentanyl Transdermal System may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl Transdermal System may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of Fentanyl Transdermal System. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of Fentanyl Transdermal System, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of Fentanyl Transdermal System with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving Fentanyl Transdermal System and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating Fentanyl Transdermal System treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the Fentanyl Transdermal System increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the Fentanyl Transdermal System application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing Fentanyl Transdermal System systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the Fentanyl Transdermal System dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing Fentanyl Transdermal System to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl Transdermal System may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with Fentanyl Transdermal System. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as Fentanyl Transdermal System and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of Fentanyl Transdermal System. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as Fentanyl Transdermal System, avoid the use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of Fentanyl Transdermal System in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of Fentanyl Transdermal System. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl Transdermal System may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl Transdermal System may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including Fentanyl Transdermal System. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the Fentanyl Transdermal System."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. ( , ) • 5.1 7.4 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. ( ) • 7.3 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced . [see and ] Dosage and Administration (2.2) Warnings and Precautions (5.5) 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved . [see ] Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved . [see ] Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression . [see ] Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co- administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. ( ) • 5.5 Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. ( , ) • 5.6 5.7 Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. ( ) • 5.9 Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO retention. ( ) • 2 5.8 Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. ( ) • 5.13 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse . As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. [see ] Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (i.e., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death . [see ] Overdosage (10) Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. [see ] Patient Counseling Information (17) 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status . Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. [see ] Overdosage (10) Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential . Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. [see ] Dosage and Administration (2) Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system . [see , ] Dosage and Administration (2.4) (2.5) 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (i.e., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant . [see ] Drug Interactions (7.1) 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration . [see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.2) 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea . Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. [see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.2) 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma . In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 2 [see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.2) 2 2 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (i.e., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. [see ] Drug Interactions (7.1) 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved . [see , and ] Drug Interactions (7.2) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure . [see ] Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources . [see ] Dosage and Administration (2.3) 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase . [see , and ] Dosing and Administration (2.2) Use in Specific Populations (8.6) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase . [see , and ] Dosing and Administration (2.2) Use in Specific Populations (8.7) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co-administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of DURAGESIC in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse DURAGESIC contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, DURAGESIC exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as DURAGESIC deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed DURAGESIC and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing DURAGESIC, and monitor all patients receiving DURAGESIC for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of DURAGESIC for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as DURAGESIC, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of DURAGESIC along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of DURAGESIC by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as DURAGESIC are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing DURAGESIC. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. DURAGESIC is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of DURAGESIC, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with DURAGESIC. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of DURAGESIC are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the DURAGESIC dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to DURAGESIC, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in DURAGESIC even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to DURAGESIC. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing DURAGESIC in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of DURAGESIC in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to DURAGESIC [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of DURAGESIC during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if DURAGESIC is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of DURAGESIC in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin DURAGESIC is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating DURAGESIC and when DURAGESIC is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with DURAGESIC, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of DURAGESIC may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of DURAGESIC in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with DURAGESIC, as DURAGESIC may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects DURAGESIC may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of DURAGESIC. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of DURAGESIC, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of DURAGESIC with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving DURAGESIC and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating DURAGESIC treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the DURAGESIC system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the DURAGESIC application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing DURAGESIC systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the DURAGESIC dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing DURAGESIC to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease DURAGESIC may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with DURAGESIC. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with DURAGESIC in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as DURAGESIC and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of DURAGESIC in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of DURAGESIC in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of DURAGESIC. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase. [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as DURAGESIC, avoid the use of DURAGESIC in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of DURAGESIC in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of DURAGESIC. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease DURAGESIC may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. DURAGESIC may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including DURAGESIC. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the DURAGESIC."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to inappropriate use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS). Premarketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in postoperative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 postoperative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) postoperative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥ 1% are presented in Table 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl transdermal system because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (5.1, 7.4) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid fentanyl transdermal system in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. (7.3) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with other CNS depressants, including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other opioids, and alcohol, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. Monitor patients receiving CNS depressants and fentanyl transdermal system for signs of respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 3A4 Isoenzymes Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with fentanyl transdermal system is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 MAO Inhibitors Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in the patient who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.4 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl transdermal system or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system. 7.5 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with opioid analgesics may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when fentanyl transdermal system is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs.",

This trial examined patients over 40 years of age with severe pain induced by osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and who were in need of and waiting for joint replacement. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with severe pain were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, constipation, hyperhidrosis, fatigue, feeling cold, and anorexia. Other common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in clinical trials in patients with chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain were headache and diarrhea. Adverse reactions reported for ≥1% of fentanyl transdermal system-treated patients and with an incidence greater than placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 3. The most common adverse reactions that were associated with discontinuation in patients with pain (causing discontinuation in ≥1% of patients) were depression, dizziness, somnolence, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. If co-administration is required, consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of pharmacological effects. (5.5) Elderly, cachectic, debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk for life-threatening respiratory depression. (5.6, 5.7) Hypotensive effects: Monitor during dose initiation and titration. (5.9) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.8) Bradycardia. Administer with caution to patients with bradyarrhythmias. (5.13) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. As modified-release products such as fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl transdermal system and in those who obtain the drug illicitly. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl transdermal system, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of fentanyl transdermal system for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed modified-release opioid formulations such as fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl transdermal system along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Abuse or misuse of fentanyl transdermal system by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose, and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Opioid agonists such as fentanyl transdermal system are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl transdermal system. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Fentanyl transdermal system is indicated only in opioid tolerant patients because of the risk for respiratory depression and death. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Closely monitor patients for respiratory depression when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl transdermal system are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Overestimating the fentanyl transdermal system dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl. 5.3 Accidental Exposure A considerable amount of active fentanyl remains in fentanyl transdermal system even after use as directed. Death and other serious medical problems have occurred when children and adults were accidentally exposed to fentanyl transdermal system. Accidental or deliberate application or ingestion by a child or adolescent will cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Placing fentanyl transdermal system in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking or overdose that could result in death. Improper disposal of fentanyl transdermal system in the trash has resulted in accidental exposures and deaths. Advise patients about strict adherence to the recommended handling and disposal instructions in order to prevent accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), (2.5)]. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in withdrawal signs in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. 5.5 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if fentanyl transdermal system is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression. If the decision to begin fentanyl transdermal system is made, reduce the starting dose, monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.6 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl transdermal system and when fentanyl transdermal system is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.7 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.8 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In addition, opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Monitor patients with brain tumors who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system, as fentanyl transdermal system may reduce respiratory drive and CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. 5.9 Hypotensive Effects Fentanyl transdermal system may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of fentanyl transdermal system. 5.10 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl transdermal system, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of fentanyl transdermal system with a CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. CYP450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating fentanyl transdermal system treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.11 Application of External Heat Exposure to heat may increase fentanyl absorption and there have been reports of overdose and death as a result of exposure to heat. A clinical pharmacology study conducted in healthy adult subjects has shown that the application of heat over the fentanyl transdermal system increased fentanyl exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warn patients to avoid exposing the fentanyl transdermal system application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.12 Patients with Fever Based on a pharmacokinetic model, serum fentanyl concentrations could theoretically increase by approximately one-third for patients with a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) due to temperature-dependent increases in fentanyl released from the system and increased skin permeability. Monitor patients wearing fentanyl transdermal systems who develop fever closely for opioid side effects and reduce the fentanyl transdermal system dose if necessary. Warn patients to avoid strenuous exertion that leads to increased core body temperature while wearing fentanyl transdermal system to avoid the risk of potential overdose and death. 5.13 Cardiac Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may produce bradycardia. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl transdermal system. 5.14 Hepatic Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with fentanyl transdermal system in patients with cirrhosis has shown that systemic fentanyl exposure increased in these patients. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system and hepatic metabolism of fentanyl, avoid use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired hepatic function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.15 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Because of the long half-life of fentanyl when administered as fentanyl transdermal system, avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment. Insufficient information exists to make precise dosing recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, to avoid starting patients with mild to moderate renal impairment on too high of a dose, start with one half of the usual dosage of fentanyl transdermal system. Closely monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, including at each dosage increase [see Dosing and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.16 Use in Pancreatic/Biliary Tract Disease Fentanyl transdermal system may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsened symptoms. Fentanyl transdermal system may cause increases in the serum amylase concentration. 5.17 Avoidance of Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with an opioid agonist analgesic, including fentanyl transdermal system. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. 5.18 Driving and Operating Machinery Strong opioid analgesics impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of the fentanyl transdermal system.",

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when OTFC is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings And Precautions (5.9)]. Monitor patients who begin or end therapy with potent inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 for signs of opioid toxicity. (5.4, 7)"

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions during titration phase (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache. (6.1) Most common adverse reactions during treatment (frequency ≥5%): dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cephalon, Inc., at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of OTFC (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate) has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of OTFC use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with OTFC are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of OTFC, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including OTFC are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of OTFC were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received OTFC for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of OTFC therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of OTFC that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system. Table 1.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OTFC (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING: IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION, DOSING, and POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.2) Full and partially consumed OTFC units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“OTFC Child Safety Kit”) (5.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate OTFC cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. (5.6) Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.7) 5.1 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of Fentora®. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage And Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Respiratory Depression As with all opioids, there is a risk of clinically significant respiratory depression in patients using OTFC. Accordingly, follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Respiratory depression may occur more readily when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that OTFC contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage And Handling (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) and the Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Muscle relaxants: Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and IONSYS for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. ( 7.2) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid use of IONSYS in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. ( 7.4) Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics: Avoid use with IONSYS because they may reduce the analgesic effect of IONSYS or precipitate withdrawal. ( 7.5) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of IONSYS with other central nervous system depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, phenothiazines, general anesthetics, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Monitor patients receiving concomitant CNS depressants and IONSYS for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]. 7.2 Muscle Relaxants IONSYS may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and IONSYS for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Drugs Affecting CYP3A4 Isoenzyme System Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with IONSYS is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who has developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with IONSYS is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression or death [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors Avoid use of IONSYS in patients who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such a treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.5 Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of IONSYS or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving IONSYS. 7.6 Diuretics IONSYS can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. IONSYS may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.7 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with IONSYS may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when IONSYS is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

( 6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact The Medicines Company at 1-877-488-6835 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled and uncontrolled studies, the safety of IONSYS 40 mcg was evaluated in a total of 2114 patients with acute postoperative pain requiring opioid analgesia. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in the placebo-controlled studies, regardless of relationship to study medication, are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions with Incidence ≥ 2% in Placebo-controlled Studies 1, 2, and 3 (N=791; 24 Hour Duration) Adverse Reactions IONSYS (n=475) Placebo (n=316) Body as a Whole Headache 9% 7% Cardiovascular System Hypotension 2% <1% Digestive System Nausea 39% 22% Vomiting 12% 6% Hemic and Lymphatic System Anemia 3% <1% Nervous System Dizziness 3% 1% Skin System Application site reaction- Erythema 14% 2% Pruritus 6% <1% Urogenital System Urinary retention 3% <1% NOTE: Patients reported as having “Nausea and vomiting” are included in “Nausea” and \"Vomiting” in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions that were reported (excluding adverse reactions listed in Table 1) in 4 active comparator trials vs. IV PCA morphine in patients treated with IONSYS (n=1288) are described below: Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, back pain, extremity pain, chest pain, chills, abdomen enlarged, asthenia, abscess, hypothermia Cardiovascular System: syncope, postural hypotension, vasodilation, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tachycardia, bigeminy, arrhythmia, myocardial infarct Digestive System: constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, ileus, dry mouth, diarrhea Metabolic and Nutritional System: peripheral edema, healing abnormal, edema, dehydration Musculoskeletal System: leg cramps and myalgia Nervous System: insomnia, anxiety, somnolence, confusion, paresthesia, hypesthesia, nervousness, agitation, abnormal dreams, tremor Respiratory System: hypoxia, hypoventilation, dyspnea, apnea, cough increased, asthma, hiccup, atelectasis, rhinitis, hyperventilation Skin System: application site reactions including: itching, vesicles, papules/pustules, edema, pain, burning, dry and flaky skin, and vesiculobullous rash, wound site oozing/bleeding, wound site inflammation/erythema, rash, sweating Special Senses: abnormal vision-blurred vision Urogenital System: urination impaired, hematuria, urinary tract infection, urinary urgency, dysuria Scheduled observation of the skin approximately 24 hours after IONSYS removal was included in several studies. Some redness at the skin sites was observed in approximately 60% of patients at this observation. The skin findings included erythema, edema, and papules. The majority of these events were categorized as mild. Two patients were noted to have hyperpigmentation lasting 2 ‑ 3 weeks at the application site. Three patients noted a rectangular mark at the application site, which persisted for up to 3 months after study completion. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of IONSYS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most commonly observed events were related to application site reactions which included urticaria, application site discharge, erosion, hyperesthesia, pustules, rash and scab, application site bleeding, application site infection, and necrosis."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause hypotension, profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. Monitor patients closely if co-administration is required. ( 5.1, 5.4, 7.1) Risk of injury during MRI: IONSYS contains metal parts and must be removed before an MRI. ( 5.5) Risk of use during other procedures (cardioversion, defibrillation, X-ray, CT, diathermy): Remove IONSYS before these procedures. ( 5.6) Topical skin reactions: If reaction is severe, discontinue IONSYS. ( 5.7) Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk of life-threatening respiratory depression. ( 5.8, 5.9) Hypotension: Monitor during dose initiation. Avoid use of IONSYS in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of IONSYS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. Opioids may obscure clinical course in patients with head injury. ( 5.11) Patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis: Monitor for worsening symptoms. ( 5.12) Increased risk of seizures in patients with seizure disorders: Monitor for worsened seizure control during IONSYS therapy. ( 5.13) Bradycardia: Closely monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.14) 5.1 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, including fentanyl, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, including fentanyl, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10.2)]. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. The use of concomitant CNS-active drugs increases the risk of respiratory depression and requires special patient care and observation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]. Keep IONSYS out of reach of children at all times. Accidental exposure to an intact IONSYS or to its components, through contact with skin or mucous membranes can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. Following accidental contact with IONSYS or its components, immediately rinse the affected area thoroughly with water. Do not use soap, alcohol, or other solvent because they may enhance the drug’s ability to penetrate the skin. The individual exposed should be monitored for signs of respiratory or central nervous system depression. If IONSYS is not handled correctly using gloves, healthcare professionals are at risk of accidental exposure to a fatal overdose of fentanyl. IONSYS is for hospital use only. Use of IONSYS outside of the hospital setting can lead to accidental exposure in others for whom it is not prescribed, causing fatal respiratory depression. Prior to the patient leaving the hospital, medical personnel must remove IONSYS and dispose of it properly. 5.2 IONSYS Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program IONSYS is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the IONSYS REMS Program because of the risk of respiratory depression resulting from accidental exposure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]. Notable requirements of the IONSYS REMS Program include the following: Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer IONSYS must be certified in the IONSYS REMS program and comply with the REMS requirements. Hospitals must only dispense IONSYS for hospital use. Further information about the IONSYS REMS Program is available at www.ionsysrems.com, or by calling 1-877-488-6835. 5.3 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse IONSYS contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Fentanyl can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing IONSYS in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Concerns about addiction, abuse, and misuse, however, should not prevent the proper management of pain. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid abuse or addiction prior to prescribing IONSYS. The risk for opioid abuse is increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with opioids; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because these drugs carry a risk for addiction even under appropriate medical use. Contact local State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if IONSYS is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of IONSYS in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]. 5.5 Risk of Injury during Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Procedure The IONSYS device is considered MR Unsafe. IONSYS contains metal parts and must be removed and properly disposed of before an MRI procedure to avoid injury to the patient and damage to IONSYS. It is unknown if exposure to an MRI procedure increases release of fentanyl from IONSYS. Monitor any patients wearing IONSYS with inadvertent exposure to an MRI for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression. 5.6 Risk of IONSYS Use during Other Procedures or Near Certain Equipment Cardioversion, Defibrillation, Radiographic Imaging Procedures other than MRI, or Diathermy Use of IONSYS during cardioversion, defibrillation, X-ray, CT, or diathermy can damage IONSYS from the strong electromagnetic fields set up by these procedures. IONSYS contains radio-opaque components and may interfere with an X-ray image or CT scan. Remove and properly dispose of IONSYS prior to cardioversion, defibrillation, X-ray, CT, or diathermy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3, 2.4)]. Synthetic Materials and Electronic Security Systems Avoid contact with synthetic materials (such as carpeted flooring) to reduce the possibility of electrostatic discharge and damage to IONSYS. Avoid exposing IONSYS to electronic security systems to reduce the possibility of damage to IONSYS. See IONSYS Important Device Instructions for additional details. Communications Equipment and Radio Frequency Identification Transmitters Use of IONSYS near communications equipment (e.g., base stations for radio telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast Radio) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transmitters can damage IONSYS. Depending on the rated maximum output power and frequency of the transmitter, the recommended separation distance between IONSYS and communications equipment or the RFID transmitter ranges between 0.12 and 23 meters. See IONSYS Important Device Instructions for detailed instructions regarding recommended separation distances. Other Electromechanical Devices Including Pacemakers or Electrical Monitoring Equipment The low-level electrical current provided by IONSYS does not result in electromagnetic interference with other electromechanical devices like pacemakers or electrical monitoring equipment. If exposure to the procedures listed above, electronic security systems, electrostatic discharge, communications equipment, or RFID transmitters occurs, and if IONSYS does not appear to function normally [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)], remove IONSYS and replace with a new IONSYS. See IONSYS Important Device Instructions for additional details including information on troubleshooting device malfunction and electromagnetic compatibility. 5.7 Topical Skin Reactions Topical skin reactions (erythema, sweating, vesicles, papules/pustules) may occur with use of IONSYS and are typically limited to the application site area. If a severe skin reaction is observed, remove IONSYS and discontinue further use. 5.8 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely; especially when IONSYS is used concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]. 5.9 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with IONSYS, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of IONSYS may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.10 Hypotensive Effect IONSYS may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating IONSYS. Avoid the use of IONSYS in patients with circulatory shock as IONSYS may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.11 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure IONSYS is not suitable for use in patients who are not alert and able to follow directions. Monitor patients using IONSYS who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with IONSYS. IONSYS may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids, including IONSYS, may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of IONSYS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions IONSYS is contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. Fentanyl may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms. Opioids, including IONSYS, may cause increases in serum amylase. 5.13 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders IONSYS may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during IONSYS therapy. 5.14 Bradycardia IONSYS may produce bradycardia in some patients. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with IONSYS. 5.15 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of IONSYS with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving IONSYS and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating IONSYS treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 5.16 Hepatic Impairment Insufficient data are available on the use of IONSYS in patients with impaired hepatic function. Since fentanyl is eliminated by hepatic metabolism and fentanyl clearance may decrease in patients with hepatic disease, monitor patients with hepatic impairment for signs of sedation and respiratory depression [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 5.17 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. •See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cephalon, Inc., at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of OTFC use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with OTFC are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of OTFC, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including OTFC are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of OTFC were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received OTFC for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of OTFC therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of OTFC that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system. Table 1.

Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to OTFC. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OTFC (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING: RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL •Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) •Full and partially consumed OTFC units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“OTFC Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) •Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) •Titrate OTFC cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC). Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of Fentora®. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that OTFC contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3), and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], OTFC is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of OTFC, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: • Healthcare professionals, who prescribe OTFC for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. • To receive OTFC, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. • Pharmacies that dispense OTFC must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. • Wholesalers and distributors that distribute OTFC must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies.

        "Drug Interactions The interaction between ritonavir, a CPY3A4 inhibitor, and fentanyl was investigated in eleven healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Subjects received oral ritonavir or placebo for 3 days. The ritonavir dose was 200 mg tid on Day 1 and 300 mg tid on Day 2 followed by one morning dose of 300 mg on Day 3. On Day 2, fentanyl was given as a single IV dose at 5 mcg/kg two hours after the afternoon dose of oral ritonavir or placebo. Naloxone was administered to counteract the side effects of fentanyl. The results suggested that ritonavir might decrease the clearance of fentanyl by 67%, resulting in a 174% (range 52% to 420%) increase in fentanyl AUC0-∞. Coadministration of ritonavir in patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system has not been studied; however, an increase in fentanyl AUC is expected (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), therefore, potential interactions may occur when fentanyl transdermal system is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with agents that induce CYP3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of fentanyl transdermal system. The concomitant use of transdermal fentanyl with all CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarmone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving fentanyl transdermal system and any CYP3A4 inhibitor should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time and dosage adjustments should be made if warranted (see BOX WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for further information).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In post-marketing experience, deaths from hypoventilation due to use of fentanyl transdermal system have been reported (see BOX WARNING and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience Although fentanyl transdermal system use in post-operative or acute pain and in patients who are not opioid-tolerant is CONTRAINDICATED, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system was originally evaluated in 357 post-operative adult patients for 1 to 3 days and 153 cancer patients for a total of 510 patients. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied in cancer patients; 56% of patients used fentanyl transdermal system for over 30 days, 28% continued treatment for more than 4 months, and 10% used fentanyl transdermal system for more than 1 year. Hypoventilation was the most serious adverse reaction observed in 13 (4%) postoperative patients and in 3 (2%) of the cancer patients. Hypotension and hypertension were observed in 11 (3%) and 4 (1%) of the opioid-naive patients. Various adverse events were reported; a causal relationship to fentanyl transdermal system was not always determined. The frequencies presented here reflect the actual frequency of each adverse effect in patients who received fentanyl transdermal system. There has been no attempt to correct for a placebo effect, concomitant use of other opioids, or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. Adverse reactions reported in 153 cancer patients at a frequency of 1% or greater are presented in Table 1; similar reactions were seen in the 357 post-operative patients. In the pediatric population, the safety of fentanyl transdermal system has been evaluated in 291 patients with chronic pain 2 to 18 years of age. The duration of fentanyl transdermal system use varied; 20% of pediatric patients were treated for ≤ 15 days; 46% for 16 to 30 days; 16% for 31 to 60 days; and 17% for at least 61 days. Twenty-five patients were treated with fentanyl transdermal system for at least 4 months and 9 patients for more than 9 months. There was no apparent pediatric-specific risk associated with fentanyl transdermal system use in children as young as 2 years old when used as directed. The most common adverse events were fever (35%), vomiting (33%), and nausea (24%). Adverse events reported in pediatric patients at a rate of ≥1% are presented in Table 1.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when ABSTRAL is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving ABSTRAL who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors need to be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Increase dosage conservatively. The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of ABSTRAL. Patients receiving ABSTRAL who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers need to be monitored for signs of increased ABSTRAL activity and the dose of ABSTRAL must be adjusted accordingly. See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5)"
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (total frequency ≥ 3%): nausea, somnolence, headache, and constipation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Galena Biopharma, Inc. at 1-888-227-8725 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/ medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ABSTRAL has been evaluated in 311 opioid-tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. Two hundred and seventy (270) of these patients were treated in multiple-dose studies. The duration of therapy for patients in multiple-dose studies ranged from 1-405 days with an average duration of 131 days and with 44 patients treated for at least 12 months. The most commonly observed adverse reactions with ABSTRAL include typical opioid adverse reactions, such as nausea, constipation, somnolence and headache. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The clinical trials of ABSTRAL were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 2 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing reactions among patients who received ABSTRAL for breakthrough pain along with concomitant opioid use for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of ABSTRAL therapy or cancer-related symptoms. Table 2 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign ABSTRAL a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNINGS: IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION and POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1, 5.4) Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from another fentanyl product to ABSTRAL. (5.2) ABSTRAL contains fentanyl in a dose that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. (5.3, 16.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4, 7) Titrate ABSTRAL cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation, and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Hypoventilation (Respiratory Depression) Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using ABSTRAL. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses, including ABSTRAL, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid- induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 ABSTRAL and Other Fentanyl Products ABSTRAL is NOT equivalent to all other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of ABSTRAL relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT convert on a mcg to mcg basis from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to ABSTRAL from other fentanyl products are not currently available except for Actiq [see Conversion from Actiq (2.2) ]. This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl. Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of ABSTRAL is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)] When dispensing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that ABSTRAL contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Even though ABSTRAL is provided in child-resistant packaging, patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep tablets out of the reach of children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1, 17.2)]. Taking ABSTRAL could be fatal in individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and the dose of ABSTRAL adjusted, if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking ABSTRAL of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause hypoventilation, titrate ABSTRAL with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of ABSTRAL may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer ABSTRAL with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; use only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous administration of fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use ABSTRAL with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors ABSTRAL is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within the past 14 days. Severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], ABSTRAL is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and longterm care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of ABSTRAL, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe ABSTRAL must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive ABSTRAL, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a PatientPrescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense ABSTRAL must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributors that distribute ABSTRAL must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."
