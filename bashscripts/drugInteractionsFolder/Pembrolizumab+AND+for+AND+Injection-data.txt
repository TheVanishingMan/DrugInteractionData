        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling. Immune-mediated pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Immune-mediated colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Immune-mediated hepatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Immune-mediated endocrinopathies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Other immune-mediated adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) with: melanoma included fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea. (6.1) NSCLC included fatigue, decreased appetite, dyspnea and cough. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS section and below reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA in an uncontrolled, open-label, multiple cohort trial (Trial 1). In Trial 1, the safety data are available from 411 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and 550 patients with metastatic NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA at either 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (n=61) or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks (n=489). Metastatic Melanoma Among the 411 patients with metastatic melanoma enrolled in Trial 1, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 6.2 months (range 1 day to 24.6 months) with a median of 10 doses (range 1 to 51). The study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range 18 to 94), 39% age 65 years or older, 60% male, 97% white, 73% with M1c disease, 8% with brain metastases, 35% with elevated LDH, 54% with prior exposure to ipilimumab, and 47% with two or more prior systemic therapies for advanced or metastatic disease. KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of the 411 patients. Adverse reactions, reported in at least two patients, that led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were: pneumonitis, renal failure, and pain. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse drug reactions reported in 2% or more of patients in Trial 1 were renal failure, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cellulitis. Table 1 presents adverse reactions identified from analyses of 89 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every three weeks in one cohort of Trial 1. Patients had documented disease progression following treatment with ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. This cohort of Trial 1 excluded patients with severe immune-related toxicity related to ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity requiring treatment with corticosteroids or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for greater than 12 weeks; a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease; or any active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C. Of the 89 patients in this cohort, the median age was 59 years (range 18 to 88), 33% were age 65 years or older, 53% were male, 98% were white, 44% had an elevated LDH, 84% had Stage M1c disease, 8% had brain metastases, and 70% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 6.2 months (range 1 day to 15.3 months) with a median of nine doses (range 1 to 23). Fifty-one percent of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for greater than 6 months and 21% for greater than 1 year. KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 6% of the 89 patients. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea.

Patients with NSCLC and autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible for Trial 1. The median age of patients was 64 years (range: 28 to 93), 47% were age 65 years or older, 53% were male, 83% were white, and 67% received two or more prior systemic treatments. Disease characteristics were Stage III (4%), Stage IV (96%), and brain metastases (11%). Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (35%) or 1 (65%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pleural effusion, pneumonia, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonitis. The incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, was similar between the two 10 mg/kg dosing schedules; therefore, these data were pooled. The majority of patients treated with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every three weeks had shorter follow-up compared with patients treated with the 10 mg/kg schedules; therefore, comparisons of adverse reactions between doses were not appropriate. Table 3 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, dyspnea, and cough.

Because trough levels of pembrolizumab interfere with the electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay results, a subset analysis was performed in the patients with a concentration of pembrolizumab below the drug tolerance level of the anti-product antibody assay. In this analysis, none of the 225 patients who were treated with 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-pembrolizumab antibodies. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to KEYTRUDA with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading."

Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. (5.8) 5.1 Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis Pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate patients with suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging and administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) or recurrent moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Melanoma Pneumonitis occurred in 12 (2.9%) of 411 melanoma patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 8 (1.9%) and 1 (0.2%) patients, respectively, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to development of pneumonitis was 5 months (range 0.3 weeks to 9.9 months). The median duration was 4.9 months (range 1 week to 14.4 months). Five of eight patients with Grade 2 and the one patient with Grade 3 pneumonitis required initial treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. The median initial dose of high-dose corticosteroid treatment was 63.4 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent with a median duration of treatment of 3 days (range 1 to 34) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 3 (0.7%) patients. Pneumonitis completely resolved in seven of the nine patients with Grade 2-3 pneumonitis. NSCLC Pneumonitis occurred in 19 (3.5%) of 550 patients with NSCLC, including Grade 2 (1.1%), 3 (1.3%), 4 (0.4%), or 5 (0.2%) pneumonitis in patients, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to development of pneumonitis was 1.7 months (range 0.6 weeks to 12.9 months). In patients receiving KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the median time to development of pneumonitis was shorter (1.5 months) compared with patients receiving 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (3.5 months). Sixteen of the 19 patients (84%) received corticosteroids, with 14 of the 19 (74%) requiring high-dose systemic corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). The median starting dose of high-dose corticosteroid treatment for these fourteen patients was 60 mg/day with a median duration of treatment of 8 days (range 1 day to 4.2 months). The median duration of pneumonitis was 1.2 months (range 0.7 weeks to 12.4 months). Pneumonitis occurred more frequently in patients with a history of asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.4%) than in patients without a history of these diseases (3.1%). Pneumonitis occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.0%) than in patients who did not receive prior thoracic radiation (2.6%). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 12 (2.2%) patients. Pneumonitis completely resolved in 9 patients. Pneumonitis was reported as ongoing in 9 patients and one patient with ongoing pneumonitis died within 30 days of the last dose of pembrolizumab. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Colitis Colitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) colitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for life-threatening (Grade 4) colitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Melanoma Colitis (including microscopic colitis) occurred in 4 (1%) of 411 patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 1 (0.2%) and 2 (0.5%) patients, respectively, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset of colitis was 6.5 months (range 2.3 to 9.8). The median duration was 2.6 months (range 0.6 weeks to 3.6 months). All three patients with Grade 2 or 3 colitis were treated with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) with a median initial dose of 70 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; the median duration of initial treatment was 7 days (range 4 to 41), followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to colitis. All four patients with colitis experienced complete resolution of the event. NSCLC Colitis occurred in 4 (0.7%) of 550 patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%) or 3 (0.4%) colitis in patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset of colitis was 1.6 months (range 4 weeks to 2.2 months) and the median duration was 16 days (range 1.0 weeks to 1.3 months).Two patients were started on high-dose corticosteroids (≥40 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) and two patients were started on low dose corticosteroids. One patient (0.2%) discontinued KEYTRUDA due to colitis. Three patients with colitis experienced complete resolution of the event. 5.3 Immune-Mediated Hepatitis Hepatitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day [for Grade 2 hepatitis] and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day [for Grade 3 or greater hepatitis] prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Melanoma Hepatitis (including autoimmune hepatitis) occurred in 2 (0.5%) of 411 patients, including a Grade 4 case in 1 (0.2%) patient, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The time to onset was 22 days for the case of Grade 4 hepatitis which lasted 1.1 months. The patient with Grade 4 hepatitis permanently discontinued KEYTRUDA and was treated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) systemic corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper. Both patients with hepatitis experienced complete resolution of the event. 5.4 Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Hypophysitis Hypophysitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) hypophysitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Melanoma Hypophysitis occurred in 2 (0.5%) of 411 patients, consisting of one Grade 2 and one Grade 4 case (0.2% each), in patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The time to onset was 1.7 months for the patient with Grade 4 hypophysitis and 1.3 months for the patient with Grade 2 hypophysitis. Both patients were treated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper and remained on a physiologic replacement dose. NSCLC In Trial 1, hypophysitis occurred in 1 (0.2%) of 550 patients, which was Grade 3 in severity. The time to onset was 3.7 months. The patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids and physiologic hormone replacement therapy. The patient did not discontinue KEYTRUDA due to hypophysitis. Thyroid Disorders Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) hyperthyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Melanoma Hyperthyroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of 411 patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 2 (0.5%) and 1 (0.2%) patients, respectively, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset was 1.5 months (range 0.5 to 2.1). The median duration was 2.8 months (range 0.9 to 6.1). One of two patients with Grade 2 and the one patient with Grade 3 hyperthyroidism required initial treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to hyperthyroidism. All five patients with hyperthyroidism experienced complete resolution of the event. Hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 patients, including a Grade 3 case in 1 (0.2%) patient, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 3.5 months (range 0.7 weeks to 19 months). All but two of the patients with hypothyroidism were treated with long-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The other two patients only required short-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. No patient received corticosteroids or discontinued KEYTRUDA for management of hypothyroidism. NSCLC Hyperthyroidism occurred in 10 (1.8%) of 550 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1, including Grade 2 (0.7%) or 3 (0.3%) hyperthyroidism. The median time to onset was 1.8 months (range 2 days to 3.4 months), and the median duration was 4.5 months (range 4 weeks to 7.5 months). No patients discontinued KEYTRUDA due to hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 38 (6.9%) of 550 patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1, including Grade 2 (5.5%) or 3 (0.2%) hypothyroidism. The median time to onset was 4.2 months (range 2.9 weeks to 11.2 months), and the median duration was 5.8 months (range 1.6 weeks to 22.8 months). No patients discontinued KEYTRUDA due to hypothyroidism. Type 1 Diabetes mellitus Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer anti-hyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.5 Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction Nephritis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a taper) for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2), and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Melanoma Nephritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) patients, consisting of one case of Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis (0.2%) and two cases of interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%), one Grade 3 and one Grade 4. The time to onset of autoimmune nephritis was 11.6 months after the first dose of KEYTRUDA (5 months after the last dose) and lasted 3.2 months; this patient did not have a biopsy. Acute interstitial nephritis was confirmed by renal biopsy in two patients with Grades 3-4 renal failure. All three patients fully recovered renal function with treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. 5.6 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Resume KEYTRUDA when the immune-mediated adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following steroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any severe or Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Across clinical studies with KEYTRUDA, the following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions have occurred: bullous pemphigoid and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Melanoma The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with KEYTRUDA in Trial 1: exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. NSCLC The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of 550 patients with NSCLC treated with KEYTRUDA in Trial 1: rash, vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, serum sickness and myasthenia gravis. 5.7 Infusion-Related Reactions Infusion-related reactions, including severe and life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA across the clinical development program employing various doses and schedules and enrolling patients with various solid tumors. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.8 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]."
