        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Panobinostat is a CYP3A substrate and inhibits CYP2D6. Panobinostat is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter system substrate. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Reduce FARYDAK dose. (7.1) Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid concomitant use with FARYDAK. (7.2) Sensitive CYP2D6 substrates: Avoid concomitant use with FARYDAK. (7.3) Anti-arrhythmic drugs/QT-prolonging drugs: Avoid concomitant use. (7.4) 7.1 Agents that May Increase FARYDAK Blood Concentrations CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of FARYDAK with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased the Cmax and AUC of panobinostat by 62% and 73% respectively, compared to when FARYDAK was given alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce dose to 10 mg when coadministered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Instruct patients to avoid star fruit, pomegranate or pomegranate juice, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice because these foods are known to inhibit CYP3A enzymes. 7.2 Agents that May Decrease FARYDAK Plasma Concentrations CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of FARYDAK with strong CYP3A inducers was not evaluated in vitro or in a clinical trial however, a reduction in panobinostat exposure is likely. An approximately 70% decrease in the systemic exposure of panobinostat in the presence of strong inducers of CYP3A was observed in simulations using mechanistic models. Therefore, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Agents whose Plasma Concentrations May be Increased by FARYDAK CYP2D6 Substrates: FARYDAK increased the median Cmax and AUC of a sensitive substrate of CYP2D6 by approximately 80% and 60%, respectively; however this was highly variable [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid coadministrating FARYDAK with sensitive CYP2D6 substrates (i.e., atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, and venlafaxine) or CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index (i.e., thioridazine, pimozide). If concomitant use of CYP2D6 substrates is unavoidable, monitor patients frequently for adverse reactions. 7.4 Drugs that Prolong QT interval Concomitant use of anti-arrhythmic medicines (including, but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol) and other drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (including, but not limited to chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, methadone, moxifloxacin, bepridil and pimozide) is not recommended. Anti-emetic drugs with known QT prolonging risk, such as dolasetron, ondansetron, and tropisetron can be used with frequent ECG monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in detail in other sections of the label: Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precaution (5.1)] Cardiac Toxicities [see Warnings and Precaution (5.2)] Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precaution (5.3)] Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precaution (5.4)] Infections [see Warnings and Precaution (5.5)] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precaution (5.6)] Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precaution (5.7)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 20%) in clinical studies are diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, peripheral edema, decreased appetite, pyrexia, and vomiting. (6.1) The most common non-hematologic laboratory abnormalities (incidence ≥ 40%) are hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and increased creatinine. The most common hematologic laboratory abnormalities (incidence ≥60%) are thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The safety data reflect subject exposure to FARYDAK from a clinical trial, in which 758 subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma received FARYDAK in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone or placebo in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (referred to as the control arm). The median duration of exposure to FARYDAK was 5 months with 16% of patients exposed to study treatment for ≥48 weeks. Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 60% of patients in the FARYDAK, bortezomib, and dexamethasone compared to 42% of patients in the control arm. The most frequent (≥5%) treatment-emergent SAEs reported for patients treated with FARYDAK were pneumonia (18%), diarrhea, (11%), thrombocytopenia (7%), fatigue (6%), and sepsis (6%). Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of FARYDAK occurred in 36% of patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuations were diarrhea, fatigue, and pneumonia. Deaths occurred in 8% of patients in the FARYDAK arm versus 5% on the control arm. The most frequent causes of death were infection and hemorrhage. Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients with ≥ 5% greater incidence in the FARYDAK arm, and Table 5 summarizes the treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage: Fatal and serious cases of gastrointestinal and pulmonary hemorrhage. Monitor platelet counts and transfuse as needed. (5.3) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor hepatic enzymes and adjust dosage if abnormal liver function tests are observed during FARYDAK therapy. (5.6) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: can cause fetal harm. Advise women of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid pregnancy while taking FARYDAK. (5.7) 5.1 Diarrhea Severe diarrhea occurred in 25% of patients treated with FARYDAK [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Diarrhea of any grade occurred in 68% of patients treated with FARYDAK compared to 42% of patients in the control arm. Diarrhea can occur at any time. Monitor patient hydration status and electrolyte blood levels, including potassium, magnesium and phosphate, at baseline and weekly (or more frequently as clinically indicated) during therapy and correct to prevent dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Initiate anti-diarrheal medication at the onset of diarrhea. Interrupt FARYDAK at the onset of moderate diarrhea (4 to 6 stools per day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Ensure that patients initiating therapy with FARYDAK have anti-diarrheal medications on hand. 5.2 Cardiac Toxicities Severe and fatal cardiac ischemic events, as well as severe arrhythmias, and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes occurred in patients receiving FARYDAK. Arrhythmias occurred in 12% of patients receiving FARYDAK, compared to 5% of patients in the control arm. Cardiac ischemic events occurred in 4% of patients treated with FARYDAK compared with 1% of patients in the control arm. Do not initiate FARYDAK treatment in patients with history of recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Electrocardiographic abnormalities such as ST-segment depression and T-wave abnormalities also occurred more frequently in patients receiving FARYDAK compared to the control arm: 22% versus 4% and 40% versus 18%, respectively. FARYDAK may prolong cardiac ventricular repolarization (QT interval). Do not initiate treatment with FARYDAK in patients with a QTcF >450 msec or clinically significant baseline ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Arrhythmias may be exacerbated by electrolyte abnormalities. If during treatment with FARYDAK, the QTcF increases to ≥480 msec, interrupt treatment. Correct any electrolyte abnormalities. If QT prolongation does not resolve, permanently discontinue treatment with FARYDAK. Obtain ECG at baseline and periodically during treatment as clinically indicated. Monitor electrolytes during treatment with FARYDAK and correct abnormalities as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hemorrhage Fatal and serious hemorrhage occurred during treatment with FARYDAK. In the clinical trial in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, 5 patients receiving FARYDAK compared to 1 patient in the control arm died due to a hemorrhagic event. All 5 patients had grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia at the time of the event. Grade 3/4 hemorrhage was reported in 4% of patients treated with the FARYDAK arm and 2% of patients in the control arm. 5.4 Myelosuppression FARYDAK causes myelosuppression, including severe thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia. In the clinical trial in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, 67% of patients treated with FARYDAK developed Grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia compared with 31% in the control arm. Thrombocytopenia led to treatment interruption and or dose modification in 31% of patients receiving FARYDAK compared to 11% of patients in the control arm. For patients receiving FARYDAK, 33% required platelet transfusion compared to 10% of patients in the control arm [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Severe neutropenia occurred in 34% of patients treated with FARYDAK, compared to 11% of patients in the control arm. Neutropenia led to treatment interruption and or dose modification in 10% of patients receiving FARYDAK. The use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was higher in patients treated with FARYDAK compared to the control arm, 13% compared to 4%, respectively. Obtain a baseline CBC and monitor the CBC weekly during treatment (or more frequently if clinically indicated). Dose modifications are recommended for Myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Monitor CBCs more frequently in patients over 65 years of age due to the increased frequency of myelosuppression in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 5.5 Infections Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, and viral infections have been reported in patients taking FARYDAK. Severe infections occurred in 31% of patients (including 10 deaths) treated with FARYDAK compared with 24% of patients (including 6 deaths) in the control arm. Infections of all grades occurred at a similar rate between arms. FARYDAK treatment should not be initiated in patients with active infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infections during treatment; if a diagnosis of infection is made, institute appropriate anti-infective treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of FARYDAK. 5.6 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, primarily elevations in aminotransferases and total bilirubin, occurred in patients treated with FARYDAK. Liver function should be monitored prior to treatment and regularly during treatment. If abnormal liver function tests are observed dose adjustments may be considered and the patient should be followed until values return to normal or pretreatment levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity FARYDAK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Panobinostat was teratogenic in rats and rabbits. If FARYDAK is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking FARYDAK, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant while taking FARYDAK. Advise sexually-active females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while taking FARYDAK and for at least 1 month after the last dose of FARYDAK. Advise sexually active men to use condoms while on treatment and for 3 months after their last dose of FARYDAK [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]."
