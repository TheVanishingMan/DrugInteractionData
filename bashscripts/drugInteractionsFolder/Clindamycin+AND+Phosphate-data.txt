        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following reactions have been reported with the use of clindamycin. Gastrointestinal: Antibiotic-associated colitis (see WARNINGS), pseudomembranous colitis abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment (see WARNINGS). An unpleasant or metallic taste occasionally has been reported after intravenous administration of the higher doses of clindamycin phosphate. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions. Rare instances of erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued. The usual agents (epinephrine, corticosteroids, antihistamines) should be available for emergency treatment of serious reactions. Skin and Mucous Membranes: Pruritus, vaginitis, and rare instances of exfoliative dermatitis have been reported. (See Hypersensitivity Reactions). Liver: Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy. Renal: Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed in rare instances. Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia) and eosinophilia have been reported. Reports of agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been made. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of the foregoing. Local Reactions: Pain, induration and sterile abscess have been reported after intramuscular injection and thrombophlebitis after intravenous infusion. Reactions can be minimized or avoided by giving deep intramuscular injections and avoiding prolonged use of indwelling intravenous catheters. Musculoskeletal: Rare instances of polyarthritis have been reported. Cardiovascular: Rare instances of cardiopulmonary arrest and hypotension have been reported following too rapid intravenous administration. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS -Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% should not be used in combination with erythromycin-containing products because of its clindamycin component. (7.1) 7.1 Erythromycin Avoid using Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% in combination with erythromycin-containing products due to its clindamycin component. In vitro studies have shown antagonism between erythromycin and clindamycin. The clinical significance of this in vitro antagonism is not known. 7.2 Concomitant Topical Medications Concomitant topical acne therapies should be used with caution since a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. If irritancy or dermatitis occurs, reduce frequency of application or temporarily interrupt treatment and resume once the irritation subsides. Treatment should be discontinued if the irritation persists. 7.3 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reaction is described in more detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label: -Colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. -The most common local adverse reactions (>= 5%) are erythema, peeling, dryness, and burning. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 397 subjects used clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% once daily for 11 weeks for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris. All subjects were graded for facial local skin reactions (erythema, peeling, burning, and dryness) on the following scale: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The percentage of subjects that had symptoms present before treatment (at baseline) and during treatment is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Local Skin Reactions With Use Of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% Combined Results From Five Trials (n=397) (Percentages derived by number of subjects receiving clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% with symptom score/number of enrolled subjects receiving clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5%). Table 1.jpg 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5%. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Anaphylaxis, as well as allergic reactions leading to hospitalization, has been reported in postmarketing use with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5%."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Colitis: Clindamycin can cause severe colitis, which may result in death. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of clindamycin. Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. (5.1) -Ultraviolet light and environmental exposure (including use of tanning beds or sun lamps): Minimize sun exposure following drug application. (5.2) 5.1 Colitis Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of clindamycin. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin. If significant diarrhea occurs, Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% should be discontinued. Severe colitis has occurred following oral and parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death. Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by Clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Benzoyl peroxide, a component of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5%, may cause increased sensitivity to sunlight. Minimize sun exposure (including use of tanning beds or sun lamps) following drug application. [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution."

(7.1) 7.1 Erythromycin Avoid using Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% in combination with erythromycin-containing products due to its clindamycin component. In vitro studies have shown antagonism between erythromycin and clindamycin. The clinical significance of this in vitro antagonism is not known. 7.2 Concomitant Topical Medications Concomitant topical acne therapies should be used with caution since a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. If irritancy or dermatitis occurs, reduce frequency of application or temporarily interrupt treatment and resume once the irritation subsides. Treatment should be discontinued if the irritation persists. 7.3 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents. 7.4 Topical Sulfone Products Use of topical benzoyl-peroxide-containing preparations with topical sulfone products may cause skin and facial hair to temporarily change color (yellow/orange)."

During clinical trials, 397 subjects used Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% once daily for 11 weeks for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris. All subjects were graded for facial local skin reactions (erythema, peeling, burning, and dryness) on the following scale: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The percentage of subjects that had symptoms present before treatment (at baseline) and during treatment is presented in Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Colitis: Clindamycin can cause severe colitis, which may result in death. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of clindamycin. Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. (5.1) -Ultraviolet light and environmental exposure (including use of tanning beds or sun lamps): Minimize sun exposure following drug application. (5.2) 5.1 Colitis Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of clindamycin. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin. If significant diarrhea occurs, Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% should be discontinued. Severe colitis has occurred following oral and parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death. Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by Clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Benzoyl peroxide, a component of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5%, may cause increased sensitivity to sunlight. Minimize sun exposure (including use of tanning beds or sun lamps) following drug application [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1).] Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In clinical trials, 3 (0.5%) of 589 nonpregnant women who received treatment with CLEOCIN Vaginal Ovules discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Adverse events judged to have a reasonable possibility of having been caused by clindamycin phosphate vaginal suppositories were reported for 10.5% of patients. Events reported by 1% or more of patients receiving CLEOCIN Vaginal Ovules were as follows: Urogenital system: Vulvovaginal disorder (3.4%), vaginal pain (1.9%), and vaginal moniliasis (1.5%). Body as a whole: Fungal infection (1.0%). Other events reported by <1% of patients included: Urogenital system: Menstrual disorder, dysuria, pyelonephritis, vaginal discharge, and vaginitis/vaginal infection. Body as a whole: Abdominal cramps, localized abdominal pain, fever, flank pain, generalized pain, headache, localized edema, and moniliasis. Digestive system: Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Skin: Nonapplication-site pruritis, rash, application-site pain, and application-site pruritis. Other clindamycin formulations The overall systemic exposure to clindamycin from CLEOCIN Vaginal Ovules is substantially lower than the systemic exposure from therapeutic doses of oral clindamycin hydrochloride (two-fold to 20-fold lower) or parenteral clindamycin phosphate (40-fold to 50-fold lower). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.) Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral or parenteral clindamycin, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of clindamycin and may also occur following administration of CLEOCIN Vaginal Ovules: Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, esophagitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pseudomembranous colitis. (See WARNINGS.) Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia), eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of these reports. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions. Rare instances of erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Liver: Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy. Musculoskeletal: Rare instances of polyarthritis have been reported. Renal: Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed in rare instances. There have been reports of pseudomembranous colitis following the administration of clindamycin vaginal cream."

Because clinical trials are also conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot always be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The following selected adverse reactions occurred in less than 0.2% of patients treated with ACANYA Gel: application site pain (0.1%); application site exfoliation (0.1%); and application site irritation (0.1%). During clinical trials, subjects were assessed for local cutaneous signs and symptoms of erythema, scaling, itching, burning and stinging. Most local skin reactions increased and peaked around week 4 and continually decreased over time reaching near baseline levels by week 12. The percentage of subjects that had symptoms present before treatment, the maximum value recorded during treatment, and the percent with symptoms present at week 12 are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Local Skin Reactions - Percent of Subjects with Symptoms Present.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Colitis: Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis, which may result in death. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin. ACANYA Gel should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. (5.1) -Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Minimize sun exposure following drug application. (5.2) 5.1Colitis Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of clindamycin. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin. When significant diarrhea occurs, ACANYA Gel should be discontinued. Severe colitis has occurred following oral and parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death. Studies indicate toxin(s) produced by Clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically. 5.2Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Minimize sun exposure including use of tanning beds or sun lamps following drug application [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical trials Non-pregnant Women: In clinical trials involving non-pregnant women, 1.8% of 600 patients who received treatment with clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% for 3 days and 2.7% of 1325 patients who received treatment for 7 days discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, possibly related, or of unknown relationship to vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2%, were reported for 20.7% of the patients receiving treatment for 3 days and 21.3% of the patients receiving treatment for 7 days. Events occurring in >=1% of patients receiving clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% are shown in Table 1. Events Occuring in >= 1% of Non-pregnant Patients Receiving Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream 2% Other events occurring in <1% of the clindamycin vaginal cream 2% groups include: Urogenital system: vaginal discharge, metrorrhagia, urinary tract infection, endometriosis, menstrual disorder, vaginitis/vaginal infection, and vaginal pain. Body as a whole: localized abdominal pain, generalized abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, halitosis, headache, bacterial infection, inflammatory swelling, allergic reaction, and fungal infection. Digestive system: nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal disorder. Endocrine system: hyperthyroidism. Central nervous system: dizziness and vertigo. Respiratory system: epistaxis. Skin: pruritus (non-application site), moniliasis, rash, maculopapular rash, erythema, and urticaria. Special senses: taste perversion. Figure Pregnant Women: In a clinical trial involving pregnant women during the second trimester, 1.7% of 180 patients who received treatment for 7 days discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, possibly related, or of unknown relationship to vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2%, were reported for 22.8% of pregnant patients. Events occurring in >=1% of patients receiving either clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% or placebo are shown in Table 2. Events Occuring in >= 1% of Pregnant Patients Receiving Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream 2% or Placebo Other events occurring in <1% of the clindamycin vaginal cream 2% group include: Urogenital system: dysuria, metrorrhagia, vaginal pain, and trichomonal vaginitis. Body as a whole: upper respiratory infection. Skin: pruritus (topical application site) and erythema. Figure Other clindamycin formulations: Clindamycin vaginal cream affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUCs) of clindamycin compared to 100 mg oral clindamycin dosing. Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral clindamycin, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. Data from well-controlled trials directly comparing clindamycin administered orally to clindamycin administered vaginally are not available. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of clindamycin: Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, esophagitis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. (See WARNINGS.) Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia), eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of these reports. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions. Rare instances of erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Liver: Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy. Musculoskeletal: Rare instances of polyarthritis have been reported. Renal: Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed in rare instances."

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse reactions that appear to be related to drug use for approximating rates. The safety data presented in Table 1 (below) reflects exposure to ZIANA Gel in 1,853 patients with acne vulgaris. Patients were 12 years and older and were treated once daily for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions that were reported in >= 1% of patients treated with ZIANA Gel were compared to adverse reactions in patients treated with clindamycin phosphate 1.2% in vehicle gel, tretinoin 0.025% in vehicle gel, and the vehicle gel alone: Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in at Least 1% of Patients Treated with ZIANA Gel: 12-Week Studies ZIANA Gel N=1853 N (%) Clindamycin N=1428 N (%) Tretinoin N=846 N (%) Vehicle N=423 N (%) PATIENTS WITH AT LEAST ONE AR 497 (27) 342 (24) 225 (27) 91 (22) Nasopharyngitis 65 (4) 64 (5) 16 (2) 5 (1) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 29 (2) 18 (1) 5 (1) 7 (2) Dry skin 23 (1) 7 (1) 3 (<1) 0 (0) Cough 19 (1) 21 (2) 9 (1) 2 (1) Sinusitis 19 (1) 19 (1) 15 (2) 4 (1) Note: Formulations used in all treatment arms were in the ZIANA vehicle gel.

In Studies 1 and 2, 1277 subjects enrolled with moderate to severe acne, 854 subjects treated with ZIANA Gel and 423 treated with vehicle. Analysis over the twelve week period demonstrated that cutaneous irritation scores for erythema, scaling, itching, burning, and stinging peaked at two weeks of therapy, and were slightly higher for the ZIANA-treated group, decreasing thereafter. One open-label 12-month safety study for ZIANA Gel showed a similar adverse reaction profile as seen in the 12-week studies. Eighteen out of 442 subjects (4%) reported gastrointestinal symptoms."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Colitis: Clindamycin can cause severe colitis, which may result in death. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of clindamycin. ZIANA Gel should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. (5.1) -Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposures: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen daily. (5.2) 5.1 Colitis Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of this product. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical clindamycin. When significant diarrhea occurs, ZIANA Gel should be discontinued. Severe colitis has occurred following oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death. Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be avoided during the use of ZIANA Gel, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Daily use of sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., a hat) are recommended. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with ZIANA Gel."

Cases of Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued. The usual agents (epinephrine, corticosteroids, antihistamines) should be available for emergency treatment of serious reactions. Skin and Mucous Membranes: Pruritus, vaginitis, and rare instances of exfoliative dermatitis have been reported (see Hypersensitivity Reactions ). Liver: Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy. Renal: Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed. Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia) and eosinophilia have been reported. Reports of agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been made. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of the foregoing. Immune system: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) cases have been reported. Local Reactions: Injection site irritation, pain, induration and sterile abscess have been reported after intramuscular injection and thrombophlebitis after intravenous infusion. Reactions can be minimized or avoided by giving deep intramuscular injections and avoiding prolonged use of indwelling intravenous catheters. Musculoskeletal: Polyarthritis cases have been reported. Cardiovascular: Cardiopulmonary arrest and hypotension have been reported following too rapid intravenous administration. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.)

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical trials Non-pregnant Women: In clinical trials involving non-pregnant women, 1.8% of 600 patients who received treatment with clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% for 3 days and 2.7% of 1,325 patients who received treatment for 7 days discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, possibly related, or of unknown relationship to vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2%, were reported for 20.7% of the patients receiving treatment for 3 days and 21.3% of the patients receiving treatment for 7 days. Events occurring in >=1% of patients receiving clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% are shown in Table 1 . Other events occurring in <1% of the clindamycin vaginal cream 2% groups include: Urogenital system: vaginal discharge, metrorrhagia, urinary tract infection, endometriosis, menstrual disorder, vaginitis/vaginal infection, and vaginal pain. Body as a whole: localized abdominal pain, generalized abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, halitosis, headache, bacterial infection, inflammatory swelling, allergic reaction, and fungal infection. Digestive system: nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal disorder. Endocrine system: hyperthyroidism. Central nervous system: dizziness and vertigo. Respiratory system: epistaxis. Skin: pruritus (non-application site), moniliasis, rash, maculopapular rash, erythema, and urticaria. Special senses: taste perversion. table 1 Pregnant Women: In a clinical trial involving pregnant women during the second trimester, 1.7% of 180 patients who received treatment for 7 days discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, possibly related, or of unknown relationship to vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2%, were reported for 22.8% of pregnant patients. Events occurring in >=1% of patients receiving either clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% or placebo are shown in Table 2 . Other events occurring in <1% of the clindamycin vaginal cream 2% group include: Urogenital system: dysuria, metrorrhagia, vaginal pain, and trichomonal vaginitis. Body as a whole: upper respiratory infection. Skin: pruritus (topical application site) and erythema. table 2 Other clindamycin formulations: Clindamycin vaginal cream affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUCs) of clindamycin compared to 100 mg oral clindamycin dosing. Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral clindamycin, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. Data from well-controlled trials directly comparing clindamycin administered orally to clindamycin administered vaginally are not available. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of clindamycin: Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, esophagitis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. (See WARNINGS. ) Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia), eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of these reports. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions. Rare instances of erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Liver: Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy. Musculoskeletal: Rare instances of polyarthritis have been reported. Renal: Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed in rare instances."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical trials Non-pregnant Women In clinical trials involving non-pregnant women, 1.8% of 600 patients who received treatment with clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% for 3 days and 2.7% of 1325 patients who received treatment for 7 days discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, possibly related, or of unknown relationship to vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2%, were reported for 20.7% of the patients receiving treatment for 3 days and 21.3% of the patients receiving treatment for 7 days. Events occurring in >=1% of patients receiving clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 - Events Occurring in >=1% of Non-pregnant Patients Receiving Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream 2% Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream Event 3 Day n=600 7 Day n=1325 Urogenital Vaginal moniliasis 7.7 10.4 Vulvovaginitis 6.0 4.4 Vulvovaginal disorder 3.2 5.3 Trichomonal vaginitis 0 1.3 Body as a Whole Moniliasis (body) 1.3 0.2 Other events occurring in <1% of the clindamycin vaginal cream 2% groups include: Urogenital system: vaginal discharge, metrorrhagia, urinary tract infection, endometriosis, menstrual disorder, vaginitis/vaginal infection, and vaginal pain. Body as a whole: localized abdominal pain, generalized abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, halitosis, headache, bacterial infection, inflammatory swelling, allergic reaction, and fungal infection. Digestive system: nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal disorder. Endocrine system: hyperthyroidism. Central nervous system: dizziness and vertigo. Respiratory system: epistaxis. Skin:: pruritus (non-application site), moniliasis, rash, maculopapular rash, erythema, and urticaria. Special senses: taste perversion. Pregnant Women In a clinical trial involving pregnant women during the second trimester, 1.7% of 180 patients who received treatment for 7 days discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, possibly related, or of unknown relationship to vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2%, were reported for 22.8% of pregnant patients. Events occurring in >=1% of patients receiving either clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% or placebo are shown in Table 2. TABLE 2 - Events Occurring in >=1% of Pregnant Patients Receiving Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream 2% or Placebo Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream Placebo Event 7 DAY n=180 7 DAY n=184 Urogenital Vaginal moniliasis 13.3 7.1 Vulvovaginal disorder 6.7 7.1 Abnormal labor 1.1 0.5 Body as a Whole Fungal infection 1.7 0 Skin Pruritus, non-application site 1.1 0 Other events occurring in <1% of the clindamycin vaginal cream 2% group include: Urogenital system: dysuria, metrorrhagia, vaginal pain, and trichomonal vaginitis. Body as a whole: upper respiratory infection. Skin: pruritus (topical application site) and erythema. Post-marketing Experience In the post-marketing period, there have been case reports of pseudomembranous colitis with the use of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream. The frequency of pseudomembranous colitis is not known. Other clindamycin formulations Clindamycin vaginal cream affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUCs) of clindamycin compared to 100 mg oral clindamycin dosing. Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral clindamycin, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. Data from well-controlled trials directly comparing clindamycin administered orally to clindamycin administered vaginally are not available. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of clindamycin: Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, esophagitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. (See WARNINGS.) Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia), eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of these reports. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions. Rare instances of erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Liver: Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy. Musculoskeletal: Rare instances of polyarthritis have been reported. Renal: Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed in rare instances."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In clinical trials, 3 (0.5%) of 589 nonpregnant women who received treatment with CLEOCIN Vaginal Ovules discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Adverse events judged to have a reasonable possibility of having been caused by clindamycin phosphate vaginal suppositories were reported for 10.5% of patients. Events reported by 1% or more of patients receiving CLEOCIN Vaginal Ovules were as follows: Urogenital system: Vulvovaginal disorder (3.4%), vaginal pain (1.9%), and vaginal moniliasis (1.5%). Body as a whole: Fungal infection (1.0%). Other events reported by <1% of patients included: Urogenital system: Menstrual disorder, dysuria, pyelonephritis, vaginal discharge, and vaginitis/vaginal infection. Body as a whole: Abdominal cramps, localized abdominal pain, fever, flank pain, generalized pain, headache, localized edema, and moniliasis. Digestive system: Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Skin: Nonapplication-site pruritis, rash, application-site pain, and application-site pruritis. Other clindamycin formulations The overall systemic exposure to clindamycin from CLEOCIN Vaginal Ovules is substantially lower than the systemic exposure from therapeutic doses of oral clindamycin hydrochloride (two-fold to 20-fold lower) or parenteral clindamycin phosphate (40-fold to 50-fold lower). (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.) Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral or parenteral clindamycin, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of clindamycin and may also occur following administration of CLEOCIN Vaginal Ovules: Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, esophagitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pseudomembranous colitis. (See WARNINGS.) Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia), eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of these reports. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions. Rare instances of erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Liver: Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy. Musculoskeletal: Rare instances of polyarthritis have been reported. Renal: Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed in rare instances. There have been reports of pseudomembranous colits following the administration of clindamycin vaginal cream."

(7.1) 7.1 Erythromycin Avoid using DUAC Gel in combination with erythromycin-containing products due to its clindamycin component. In vitro studies have shown antagonism between erythromycin and clindamycin. The clinical significance of this in vitro antagonism is not known. 7.2 Concomitant Topical Medications Concomitant topical acne therapies should be used with caution since a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. If irritancy or dermatitis occurs, reduce frequency of application or temporarily interrupt treatment and resume once the irritation subsides. Treatment should be discontinued if the irritation persists. 7.3 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. DUAC Gel should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents. 7.4 Topical Sulfone Products Use of topical benzoyl-peroxide-containing preparations with topical sulfone products may cause skin and facial hair to temporarily change color (yellow/orange)."

During clinical trials, 397 subjects used DUAC Gel once daily for 11 weeks for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris. All subjects were graded for facial local skin reactions (erythema, peeling, burning, and dryness) on the following scale: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The percentage of subjects that had symptoms present before treatment (at baseline) and during treatment is presented in Table 1. Table 1.

Severe colitis has occurred following oral and parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death. Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by Clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Benzoyl peroxide, a component of DUAC Gel, may cause increased sensitivity to sunlight. Minimize sun exposure (including use of tanning beds or sun lamps) following drug application. [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1.)] Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical trials Non-pregnant Women: In clinical trials involving non-pregnant women, 1.8% of 600 patients who received treatment with clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% for 3 days and 2.7% of 1325 patients who received treatment for 7 days discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, possibly related, or of unknown relationship to vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2%, were reported for 20.7% of the patients receiving treatment for 3 days and 21.3% of the patients receiving treatment for 7 days. Events occurring in >=1% of patients receiving clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% are shown in Table 1. Table 1- Events Occurring in >=1% of Non-pregnant Patients Receiving Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream 2% Other events occurring in <1% of the clindamycin vaginal cream 2% groups include: Urogenital system: vaginal discharge, metrorrhagia, urinary tract infection, endometriosis, menstrual disorder, vaginitis/vaginal infection, and vaginal pain. Body as a whole: localized abdominal pain, generalized abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, halitosis, headache, bacterial infection, inflammatory swelling, allergic reaction, and fungal infection. Digestive system: nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal disorder. Endocrine system: hyperthyroidism. Central nervous system: dizziness and vertigo. Respiratory system: epistaxis. Skin: pruritus (non-application site), moniliasis, rash, maculopapular rash, erythema, and urticaria. Special senses: taste perversion. Table 1 Pregnant Women: In a clinical trial involving pregnant women during the second trimester, 1.7% of 180 patients who received treatment for 7 days discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, possibly related, or of unknown relationship to vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2%, were reported for 22.8% of pregnant patients. Events occurring in >=1% of patients receiving either clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% or placebo are shown in Table 2. Table 2- Events Occurring in >=1% of Pregnant Patients Receiving Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream 2% or Placebo Other events occurring in <1% of the clindamycin vaginal cream 2% group include: Urogenital system: dysuria, metrorrhagia, vaginal pain, and trichomonal vaginitis. Body as a whole: upper respiratory infection. Skin: pruritus (topical application site) and erythema. Table 2 Other clindamycin formulations: Clindamycin vaginal cream affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUCs) of clindamycin compared to 100 mg oral clindamycin dosing. Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral clindamycin, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. Data from well-controlled trials directly comparing clindamycin administered orally to clindamycin administered vaginally are not available. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of clindamycin: Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, esophagitis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of clindamycin. EVOCLIN Foam should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. (5.1) 5.1 Colitis Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of this product. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical clindamycin. If significant diarrhea occurs, EVOCLIN Foam should be discontinued. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2).] Severe colitis has occurred following oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death. Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by Clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically. 5.2 Irritation EVOCLIN Foam can cause irritation. Concomitant topical acne thereapy should be used with caution since a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. If irritation or dermatitis occurs, clindamycin should be discontinued. Avoid contact of EVOCLIN Foam with eyes, mouth, lips, other mucous membranes or areas of broken skin. If contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. EVOCLIN Foam should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS C. difficile-associated diarrhea: Discontinue and evaluate if diarrhea occurs (5.1) Rubber or latex products: Do not use barrier contraceptives (condoms or vaginal contraceptive diaphragms) concurrently or for 5 days following treatment. Condoms may not be reliable for preventing pregnancy or for protecting against transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases during this time (5.2) 5.1 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.2 Use with Condoms and Vaginal Contraceptive Diaphragms This cream contains mineral oil that may weaken latex or rubber products such as condoms or vaginal contraceptive diaphragms. Therefore, the use of such barrier contraceptives is not recommended concurrently or for 5 days following treatment with Clindesse. During this time period, condoms may not be reliable for preventing pregnancy or for protecting against transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical trials Non-pregnant Women: In clinical trials involving non-pregnant women, 1.8% of 600 patients who received treatment with clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% for 3 days and 2.7% of 1325 patients who received treatment for 7 days discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, possibly related, or of unknown relationship to vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2%, were reported for 20.7% of the patients receiving treatment for 3 days and 21.3% of the patients receiving treatment for 7 days. Events occurring in >=1% of patients receiving clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% are shown in Table 1. Events Occuring in >= 1% of Non-pregnant Patients Receiving Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream 2% Events Occuring in >= 1% of Non-pregnant Patients Receiving Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream 2% Other events occurring in <1% of the clindamycin vaginal cream 2% groups include: Urogenital system: vaginal discharge, metrorrhagia, urinary tract infection, endometriosis, menstrual disorder, vaginitis/vaginal infection, and vaginal pain. Body as a whole: localized abdominal pain, generalized abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, halitosis, headache, bacterial infection, inflammatory swelling, allergic reaction, and fungal infection. Digestive system: nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal disorder. Endocrine system: hyperthyroidism. Central nervous system: dizziness and vertigo. Respiratory system: epistaxis. Skin: pruritus (non-application site), moniliasis, rash, maculopapular rash, erythema, and urticaria. Special senses: taste perversion. Figure Pregnant Women: In a clinical trial involving pregnant women during the second trimester, 1.7% of 180 patients who received treatment for 7 days discontinued therapy due to drug-related adverse events. Medical events judged to be related, probably related, possibly related, or of unknown relationship to vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2%, were reported for 22.8% of pregnant patients. Events occurring in >=1% of patients receiving either clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% or placebo are shown in Table 2. Events Occuring in >= 1% of Pregnant Patients Receiving Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream 2% or Placebo Events Occuring in >= 1% of Pregnant Patients Receiving Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Cream 2% or Placebo Other events occurring in <1% of the clindamycin vaginal cream 2% group include: Urogenital system: dysuria, metrorrhagia, vaginal pain, and trichomonal vaginitis. Body as a whole: upper respiratory infection. Skin: pruritus (topical application site) and erythema. Figure Other clindamycin formulations: Clindamycin vaginal cream affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUCs) of clindamycin compared to 100 mg oral clindamycin dosing. Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral clindamycin, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. Data from well-controlled trials directly comparing clindamycin administered orally to clindamycin administered vaginally are not available. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of clindamycin: Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, esophagitis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. (See WARNINGS.) Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia), eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of these reports. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions. Rare instances of erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Liver: Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy. Musculoskeletal: Rare instances of polyarthritis have been reported. Renal: Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed in rare instances."

Body as a whole: upper respiratory infection. Skin: pruritus (topical application site) and erythema. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. In the post-marketing period, there have been case reports of pseudomembranous colitis with the use of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream. Other clindamycin formulations Clindamycin vaginal cream affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUCs) of clindamycin compared to 100 mg oral clindamycin dosing. Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral clindamycin, the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. Data from well-controlled trials directly comparing clindamycin administered orally to clindamycin administered vaginally are not available. The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of clindamycin: Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, esophagitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. (See WARNINGS.) Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia), eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of these reports. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions. Rare instances of erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin. A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Liver: Jaundice and abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed during clindamycin therapy. Musculoskeletal: Rare instances of polyarthritis have been reported. Renal: Although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by azotemia, oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed in rare instances."

The data described below reflect exposure to Clindesse in 368 patients. Clindesse was studied in three clinical studies: placebo-controlled (n=85), active-controlled (n=263), and single-arm (n=20). The population was female, aged 18 to 78, who were diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis. Patient demographics in the trials were 51% Caucasian, 36% Black, 10% Hispanic, and 3% Asian, other or unknown. All patients received 100 mg clindamycin phosphate cream intravaginally in a single dose. Of the 368 women treated with a single dose of Clindesse, 1.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions occurred in 126 of 368 patients (34%) treated with Clindesse and in 32 of 85 patients (38%) treated with placebo. Adverse reactions occurring in >=2% of patients receiving Clindesse in the placebo-controlled clinical trial are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Occurring in >=2% of Clindesse -Treated Patients and at a Higher Rate than Placebo-Treated Patients N = number of patients in intent-to-treat population n (%) = number and percentage of patients with reported adverse reaction NOS = not otherwise specified The use of clindamycin may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible fungal organisms in the vagina and may require antifungal treatment Other reactions reported by <1% of those women treated with Clindesse include: Dermatologic: Pruritic rash Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, vomiting General: Fatigue Immune System: Hypersensitivity Nervous System: Dizziness Reproductive System: Dysfunctional uterine bleeding, dysmennorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, vaginal burning, vaginal irritation, vulvar erythema, vulvitis, vulvovaginal discomfort, vulvovaginal dryness, vulvovaginitis Table 1 6.2 Other Clindamycin Formulations Clindesse affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUCs) of clindamycin compared to an oral or intravenous dose of clindamycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Data from well-controlled trials directly comparing clindamycin administered orally to clindamycin administered vaginally are not available. The following additional adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of clindamycin: Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, esophagitis, nausea, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Hematopoietic: Transient neutropenia (leukopenia), eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported. No direct etiologic relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of these reports. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Maculopapular rash, vesiculobullous rash, and urticaria have been observed during drug therapy. Generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like skin rashes are the most frequently reported of all adverse reactions.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - C. difficile-associated diarrhea: Discontinue and evaluate if diarrhea occurs (5.1) -Rubber or latex products: Do not use barrier contraceptives (condoms or vaginal contraceptive diaphragms) concurrently or for 5 days following treatment. Condoms may not be reliable for preventing pregnancy or for protecting again transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases during this time (5.2) 5.1 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2]. 5.2 Use with Condoms and Vaginal Contraceptive Diaphragms This cream contains mineral oil that may weaken latex or rubber products such as condoms or vaginal contraceptive diaphragms. Therefore, the use of such barrier contraceptives is not recommended concurrently or for 5 days following treatment with Clindesse. During this time period, condoms may not be reliable for preventing pregnancy or for protecting against transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases."
