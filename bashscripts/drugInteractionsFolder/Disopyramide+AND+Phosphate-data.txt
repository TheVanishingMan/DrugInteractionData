Infrequent occurrences of reversible cholestatic jaundice, fever, and respiratory difficulty have been reported in association with disopyramide therapy, as have rare instances of thrombocytopenia, reversible agranulocytosis, and gynecomastia.

Urinary retention is the most serious anticholinergic effect. The following reactions were reported in 10% to 40% of patients: Anticholinergic: dry mouth (32%), urinary hesitancy (14%), constipation (11%) The following reactions were reported in 3% to 9% of patients: Anticholinergic: blurred vision, dry nose/eyes/throat Genitourinary: urinary retention, urinary frequency and urgency Gastrointestinal: nausea, pain/bloating/gas General: dizziness, general fatigue/muscle weakness, headache, malaise, aches/pains The following reactions were reported in 1% to 3% of patients: Genitourinary: impotence Cardiovascular: hypotension with or without congestive heart failure, increased congestive heart failure (see ), cardiac conduction disturbances (see ), edema/weight gain, shortness of breath, syncope, chest pain Warnings Warnings Gastrointestinal: anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting Dermatologic: generalized rash/dermatoses, itching Central nervous system: nervousness Other: hypokalemia, elevated cholesterol/triglycerides The following reactions were reported in less than 1%: Depression, insomnia, dysuria, numbness/tingling, elevated liver enzymes, AV block, elevated BUN, elevated creatinine, decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit Hypoglycemia has been reported in association with Norpace administration (see ). Warnings Infrequent occurrences of reversible cholestatic jaundice, fever, and respiratory difficulty have been reported in association with disopyramide therapy, as have rare instances of thrombocytopenia, reversible agranulocytosis, and gynecomastia. Some cases of LE (lupus erythematosus) symptoms have been reported; most cases occurred in patients who had been switched to disopyramide from procainamide following the development of LE symptoms. Rarely, acute psychosis has been reported following Norpace therapy, with prompt return to normal mental status when therapy was stopped. The physician should be aware of these possible reactions and should discontinue Norpace or Norpace CR therapy promptly if they occur."
