        "Drug Interactions Prior administration of succinylcholine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking effect of pancuronium bromide and increase its duration of action. If succinylcholine is used before pancuronium bromide the administration of pancuronium bromide should be delayed until the patient starts recovering from succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade. If a small dose of pancuronium bromide is given at least 3 minutes prior to the administration of succinylcholine, in order to reduce the incidence and intensity of succinylcholine-induced fasciculations, this dose may induce a degree of neuromuscular block sufficient to cause respiratory depression in some patients. Other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (vecuronium, atracurium, d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and gallamine) behave in a clinically similar fashion to pancuronium bromide. The combinations of pancuronium bromide-metocurine and pancuronium bromide-d-tubocurarine are significantly more potent than the additive effects of each of the individual drugs given alone; however, the duration of blockade of these combinations is not prolonged. There are insufficient data to support concomitant use of pancuronium and the other three above mentioned muscle relaxants in the same patients."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neuromuscular The most frequent adverse reaction to nondepolarizing blocking agents as a class consists of an extension of the drug's pharmacological action beyond the time period needed. This may vary from skeletal muscle weakness to profound and prolonged skeletal muscle paralysis resulting in respiratory insufficiency or apnea. Inadequate reversal of the neuromuscular blockade is possible with pancuronium bromide as with all curariform drugs. These adverse experiences are managed by manual or mechanical ventilation until recovery is judged adequate. Prolonged paralysis and/or skeletal muscle weakness have been reported after long-term use to support mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Cardiovascular See discussion of circulatory effects in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY . Gastrointestinal Salivation is sometimes noted during very light anesthesia, especially if no anticholinergic premedication is used. Skin An occasional transient rash is noted accompanying the use of pancuronium bromide. Other Although histamine release is not a characteristic action of pancuronium bromide, rare hypersensitivity reactions such as bronchospasm, flushing, redness, hypotension, tachycardia, and other reactions possibly mediated by histamine release have been reported. Post-Marketing There have been post-marketing reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) associated with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, including pancuronium bromide. These reactions, in some cases, have been life-threatening and fatal. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS)."
