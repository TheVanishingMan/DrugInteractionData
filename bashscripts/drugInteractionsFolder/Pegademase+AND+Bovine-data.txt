        "Drug Interactions There are no known drug interactions with ADAGEN(R) (pegademase bovine) Injection. However, Vidarabine is a substrate for ADA and 2â€²-deoxycoformycin is a potent inhibitor of ADA. Thus, the activities of these drugs and ADAGEN(R) (pegademase bovine) Injection could be substantially altered if they are used in combination with one another."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical experience with ADAGEN(R) (pegademase bovine) Injection has been limited. The following adverse reactions were reported: headache in one patient and pain at the injection site in two patients. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ADAGEN (R) (pegademase bovine) Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a very small population, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hematologic events: hemolytic anemia, auto-immune hemolytic anemia, thrombocythemia, thrombocytopenia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Dermatological events: injection site erythema, urticaria. Lymphomas To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-888-393-4584 or by email at drugsafety@sigmatau.com or contact the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch."
