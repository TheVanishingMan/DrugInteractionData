In larger controlled trials with other clobetasol propionate formulations, the most frequently reported local adverse reactions have included burning, stinging, irritation, pruritus, erythema, folliculitis, cracking and fissuring of the skin, numbness of the fingers, skin atrophy, and telangiectasia (all less than 2%). The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids, but they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids such as clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05%. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: dryness, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, striae, and miliaria."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested. (5.1) Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. (5.1) Systemic absorption may require periodic evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Modify use if HPA axis suppression develops. (5.1) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions include: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria. (5.2) Clobetasol Propionate Spray, 0.05% is flammable, keep away from heat or flame. (5.5) 5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. In studies evaluating the potential for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, using the Cosyntropin Stimulation Test, Clobetasol Propionate Spray, 0.05% demonstrated rates of suppression that were comparable after 2 and 4 weeks of twice-daily use (19% and 15-20%, respectively), in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (≥20% BSA). In these studies, HPA axis suppression was defined as serum cortisol level ≤18 μg/dL 30-min post cosyntropin stimulation [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Clobetasol Propionate Spray, 0.05% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. 5.5 Flammable Contents Clobetasol Propionate Spray, 0.05% is flammable; keep away from heat or flame."

(5.1) Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. (5.1) Systemic absorption may require periodic evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Modify use if HPA axis suppression develops. (5.1) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) If irritation develops in the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of clobetasol propionate shampoo should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.(5.3) Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions include: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria. (5.4) 5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. The effect of clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05% on HPA axis suppression was evaluated in one trial in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. In this trial, 5 of 12 evaluable subjects developed suppression of their HPA axis following 4 weeks of treatment with clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05% applied once daily for 15 minutes to a dry scalp before lathering and rinsing. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression.

Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.2 Allergic Contact Dermatitis If irritation develops, clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation.

In rare instances, treatment (or withdrawal of treatment) of psoriasis with corticosteroids is thought to have exacerbated the disease or provoked the pustular form of the disease, so careful patient supervision is recommended."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In a controlled pharmacokinetic study, 5 of 13 subjects experienced reversible suppression of the adrenals at any time during the 14 days of clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% therapy to at least 20% of the body surface area. Of the 13 subjects studied, 1 of 9 with psoriasis were suppressed after 14 days and all 4 of the subjects with atopic dermatitis had abnormal cortisol levels indicative of adrenal suppression at some time after starting therapy with clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05%. See Table 3 below. Table 3: Subjects with reversible HPA axis suppression at any time during treatment Dermatosis Clobetasol Propionate Foam, 0.05% Psoriasis 1 of 9 Atopic DermatitisClobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% is not indicated for non-scalp atopic dermatitis, as the safety and efficacy of clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% in non-scalp atopic dermatitis has not been established. Use in children under 12 years of age is not recommended. 4 of 4 Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible adrenal suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. See PRECAUTIONS. In a controlled clinical trial (188 subjects) with clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% in subjects with psoriasis of the scalp, there were no localized scalp adverse reactions reported in the clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% treated subjects. In two controlled clinical trials (360 subjects) with clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% in subjects with psoriasis of non-scalp regions, localized adverse events that occurred in the clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% treated subjects included application site burning (10%), application site dryness (<1%), and other application site reactions (4%). In larger controlled trials with other clobetasol propionate formulations, the most frequently reported local adverse reactions have included burning, stinging, irritation, pruritus, erythema, folliculitis, cracking and fissuring of the skin, numbness of the fingers, skin atrophy, and telangiectasia (all less than 2%). The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids, but they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids such as clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05%. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: dryness, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, striae, and miliaria."
