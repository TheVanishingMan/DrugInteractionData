        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when SUBSYS is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of SUBSYS with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving SUBSYS concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. The concomitant use of SUBSYS with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of SUBSYS. Patients receiving SUBSYS who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored for signs of increased SUBSYS activity and the dose of SUBSYS should be adjusted accordingly. Concomitant use of SUBSYS with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions during treatment (frequency ≥5%): vomiting, nausea, constipation, dyspnea, and somnolence. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Insys Therapeutics, Inc., at 1-855-978-2797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/ medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of SUBSYS has been evaluated in a total of 359 opioid-tolerant patients with breakthrough cancer pain. The duration of SUBSYS use varied during the open-label study. Safety data from a long-term extension study showed that the average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 66 days. The maximum duration of therapy was 149 days. The dose range studied in these trials ranged from 100 mcg per dose to 1600 mcg per dose. The most commonly observed adverse reactions seen with SUBSYS are typical opioid side effects such as nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and constipation. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including SUBSYS are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of SUBSYS was nausea. There were also adverse reactions of abdominal distension, anorexia, confusional state, disorientation, somnolence, and constipation. The clinical trials of SUBSYS were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain; all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received SUBSYS for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. Table 3 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater that occurred during titration in the clinical trials.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) Full and consumed SUBSYS units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. (5.3, 16.2) Use with other CNS depressants and moderate or strong CYP450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate SUBSYS cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in SUBSYS. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing SUBSYS is not bioequivalent with other fentanyl products. Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from other fentanyl products. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute a SUBSYS prescription for any other fentanyl product. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of SUBSYS compared to other fentanyl products that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of the same dose of SUBSYS for the same dose of any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) All patients should be titrated from the 100 mcg dose. Titrate each patient individually to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that SUBSYS contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. All used units should be disposed of immediately after use as they represent a special risk to children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), Patient Counseling Information (17), and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. SUBSYS could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of SUBSYS with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of SUBSYS if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking SUBSYS of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate SUBSYS with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of SUBSYS may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer SUBSYS with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use SUBSYS with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors SUBSYS is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) ACCESS Program Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], SUBSYS is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the TIRF REMS ACCESS program. Under the TIRF REMS ACCESS program, outpatients, prescribers who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of SUBSYS, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS ACCESS program are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe SUBSYS must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS ACCESS program, enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. To receive SUBSYS, patients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense SUBSYS must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributors that distribute SUBSYS must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) 7.1 Metabolic Drug Interactions Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when Lazanda is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. CYP3A4 inhibitors The concomitant use of Lazanda with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving Lazanda who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors are to be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Increase dose conservatively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. CYP3A4 inducers The concomitant use of Lazanda with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of Lazanda. Patients receiving Lazanda who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers may experience sudden increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and are to be monitored for signs of increased Lazanda activity. Adjust the dose of Lazanda accordingly. 7.2 Non-metabolic Drug Interactions Agents used to treat Allergic Rhinitis The presence of allergic rhinitis is not expected to affect Lazanda absorption. However, co-administration of a vasoconstrictive nasal decongestant such as oxymetazoline to treat allergic rhinitis leads to lower peak plasma concentrations and a delayed Tmax of fentanyl that may cause Lazanda to be less effective in patients with allergic rhinitis who use such decongestants, thus potentially impairing pain management. Additionally, in view of the possibility that the titration of a patient while they are experiencing an acute episode of rhinitis could lead to incorrect dose identification (particularly if they are using a vasoconstrictive decongestant), titration under these circumstances must be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. MAO inhibitor Concomitant use of Lazanda with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuing an MAO inhibitor, is not recommended."

[6.1] To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Archimedes Pharma at 1-866-435-6775 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Lazanda has been evaluated in a total of 523 opioid-tolerant patients with breakthrough cancer pain. The average duration of therapy in patients in the long-term study was 73 days, with 153 patients being treated for over 3 months. Patients continuing into the open-label extension period of the safety study have been treated for up to 26 months. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with Lazanda are typical of opioid side effects, such as nausea, constipation, somnolence, and headache. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The clinical trials of Lazanda were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain; all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone, or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 1 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received Lazanda for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of Lazanda therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse events are included regardless of causality or severity. Table 1 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign Lazanda a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. [5.1] Do not convert patients to Lazanda from other fentanyl products on a mcg per mcg basis, or substitute a Lazanda prescription for another fentanyl product, such substitution may result in fatal overdose. [5.2] Lazanda bottles contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. [5.3, 16.2, 16.3] Use with other CNS depressants and potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. [5.2, 5.4] Titrate Lazanda cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. [5.2, 5.6, 5.7] 5.1 Respiratory Depression Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using Lazanda. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Lazanda and other Fentanyl Products Lazanda is NOT equivalent to other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of Lazanda relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing Lazanda to a patient, DO NOT convert from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to Lazanda from other fentanyl products are not currently available. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl). Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of Lazanda is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] When dispensing Lazanda to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Information for Patients and Their Caregivers Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that Lazanda contains medicine in an amount that could be fatal to a child. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused bottles in their child-resistant container and out of the reach of children at all times. Partially used bottles represent a special risk to children. As soon as they are no longer required, all used, unopened or partially used bottles must be completely emptied of accessible fentanyl solution by spraying the remaining contents into the carbon-lined pouch. The sealed pouch and the empty bottle should be put into the child-resistant container before discarding in the trash. Hands must be washed with soap and water immediately after handling the pouch. [see Storage and Handling (16.2) , Disposal of Lazanda (16.3) , and Patient/Caregiver Instructions (17.1) ]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must question patients and caregivers specifically about the presence of children in the home on a full-time or visiting basis and counsel accordingly regarding the dangers to children of inadvertent exposure to Lazanda. Lazanda could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of Lazanda with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Metabolic Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and may require adjustment of the dose of Lazanda. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking Lazanda of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, cautiously adjust the dose of Lazanda in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of Lazanda may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer Lazanda with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; only use opioids if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Use Lazanda with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors Lazanda is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. [see Non-metabolic Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ], Lazanda is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of Lazanda, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals who prescribe Lazanda must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive Lazanda, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense Lazanda must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributers that distribute Lazanda must enroll in the program and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.tirfremsaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when ABSTRAL is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving ABSTRAL who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors need to be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Increase dosage conservatively. The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of ABSTRAL. Patients receiving ABSTRAL who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers need to be monitored for signs of increased ABSTRAL activity and the dose of ABSTRAL must be adjusted accordingly.

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ProStrakan, Inc. at 1-888-227-8725 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ABSTRAL has been evaluated in 311 opioid-tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. Two hundred and seventy (270) of these patients were treated in multiple-dose studies. The duration of therapy for patients in multiple-dose studies ranged from 1-405 days with an average duration of 131 days and with 44 patients treated for at least 12 months. The most commonly observed adverse reactions with ABSTRAL include typical opioid adverse reactions, such as nausea, constipation, somnolence and headache. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The clinical trials of ABSTRAL were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 1 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing reactions among patients who received ABSTRAL for breakthrough pain along with concomitant opioid use for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of ABSTRAL therapy or cancer-related symptoms. Table 1 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign ABSTRAL a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNINGS: IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION and POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1, 5.4) Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from another fentanyl product to ABSTRAL. (5.2) ABSTRAL contains fentanyl in a dose that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. (5.3, 16.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4, 7) Titrate ABSTRAL cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation, and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Hypoventilation (Respiratory Depression) Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using ABSTRAL. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses, including ABSTRAL, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 ABSTRAL and Other Fentanyl Products) ABSTRAL is NOT equivalent to all other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of ABSTRAL relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT convert from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to ABSTRAL from other fentanyl products are not currently available. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl). Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of ABSTRAL is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)] When dispensing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that ABSTRAL contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Even though ABSTRAL is provided in child-resistant packaging, patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep tablets out of the reach of children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1, 17.2)]. Taking ABSTRAL could be fatal in individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and the dose of ABSTRAL adjusted, if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking ABSTRAL of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause hypoventilation, titrate ABSTRAL with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of ABSTRAL may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer ABSTRAL with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; use only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous administration of fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use ABSTRAL with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors ABSTRAL is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within the past 14 days. Severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], ABSTRAL is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program.

Patients receiving oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mallinckrodt Inc., at 1-800-778-7898 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) Full and partially consumed oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is NOT a generic version of Fentora® (fentanyl citrate buccal tablet). When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3) and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: Healthcare professionals, who prescribe oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. To receive oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. Pharmacies that dispense oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. Wholesalers and distributors, that distribute oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. •See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cephalon, Inc., at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of OTFC use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with OTFC are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of OTFC, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including OTFC are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of OTFC were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received OTFC for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of OTFC therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of OTFC that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system. Table 1.

Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to OTFC. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OTFC (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING: RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL •Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.2) •Full and partially consumed Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“OTFC Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) •Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) •Titrate OTFC cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in ACTIQ. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora ®). When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) prescription under any circumstances. Fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage And Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage And Handling, (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.3) and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [ see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9)], OTFC is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration, (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of OTFC, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access Program are: •Healthcare professionals, who prescribe OTFC for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access Program, enroll in the program, and commit to comply with the REMS requirements. •To receive OTFC, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits of the drug and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. •Pharmacies, that dispense OTFC, must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. •Wholesalers and distributors, that distribute OTFC must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized enrolled pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822 1483."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when OTFC is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [ see Warnings And Precautions (5.9)]. •See Boxed Warning and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash and insomnia. ( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical at 1-800-828-9393 option 2 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of OTFC use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with OTFC are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of OTFC, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including OTFC are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of OTFC were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received OTFC for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of OTFC therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of OTFC that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora ®). When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) prescription under any circumstances. Fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including fentanyl buccal tablets (Fentora®) that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage And Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage And Handling, (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.3) and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [ see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE (9)], OTFC is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration, (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of OTFC, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access Program are: •Healthcare professionals, who prescribe OTFC for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access Program, enroll in the program, and commit to comply with the REMS requirements. •To receive OTFC, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits of the drug and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. •Pharmacies, that dispense OTFC, must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. •Wholesalers and distributors, that distribute OTFC must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized enrolled pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822 1483."

        "Drug Interactions Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g., barbiturates, tranquilizers, narcotics and general anesthetics) will have additive or potentiating effects with fentanyl. When patients have received such drugs, the dose of fentanyl required will be less than usual. Following the administration of fentanyl citrate, the dose of other CNS depressant drugs should be reduced."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS As with other narcotic analgesics, the most common serious adverse reactions reported to occur with fentanyl are respiratory depression, apnea, rigidity and bradycardia; if these remain untreated, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression or cardiac arrest could occur. Other adverse reactions that have been reported are hypertension, hypotension, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, emesis, laryngospasm and diaphoresis. It has been reported that secondary rebound respiratory depression may occasionally occur postoperatively. Patients should be monitored for this possibility and appropriate countermeasures taken as necessary. When a tranquilizer such as droperidol is used with fentanyl citrate, the following adverse reactions can occur: chills and/or shivering, restlessness and postoperative hallucinatory episodes (sometimes associated with transient periods of mental depression); extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonia, akathisia and oculogyric crisis) have been observed up to 24 hours postoperatively. When they occur, extrapyramidal symptoms can usually be controlled with anti-parkinson agents. Postoperative drowsiness is also frequently reported following the use of droperidol."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human CYP3A4 isoenzyme system; therefore potential interactions may occur when FENTORA is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of FENTORA with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving FENTORA who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done cautiously [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The concomitant use of FENTORA with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of FENTORA. Patients receiving FENTORA who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored for signs of increased FENTORA activity and the dose of FENTORA should be adjusted accordingly. See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions. (5.4, 7)"

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals, at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of FENTORA has been evaluated in 304 opioid-tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. The average duration of therapy was 76 days with some patients being treated for over 12 months. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with FENTORA are typical of opioid side effects. Opioid side effects should be expected and managed accordingly. The clinical trials of FENTORA were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received FENTORA for breakthrough pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of FENTORA therapy or cancer-related symptoms.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) Fentora is not bioequivalent to other fentanyl products. Do not convert from other fentanyl products on a mcg per mcg basis. (5.2) Use with other CNS depressants and cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate FENTORA cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) Application site reactions occurred in 10% of patients in clinical trials and ranged from paresthesia to ulceration and bleeding. (5.8) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in FENTORA. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing FENTORA is not bioequivalent with other fentanyl products. Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from other fentanyl products. There are no conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products other than Actiq. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) For patients being converted from Actiq, it is necessary to follow the instructions found in Table 1 in Section 2.1,.as Actiq and FENTORA are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. FENTORA is NOT a generic version of Actiq. All patients should be titrated from the 100 mcg dose. The initial dose of FENTORA should be 100 mcg. Titrate each patient individually to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] When dispensing, DO NOT substitute a FENTORA prescription for an Actiq prescription under any circumstances. FENTORA and Actiq are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of FENTORA compared to other fentanyl products including Actiq that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of the same dose of FENTORA for the same dose of Actiq or any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that FENTORA contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep tablets out of the reach of children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1) ] 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of FENTORA with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of FENTORA if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking FENTORA of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate FENTORA with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of FENTORA may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer FENTORA with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Application Site Reactions In clinical trials, 10% of all patients exposed to FENTORA reported application site reactions. These reactions ranged from paresthesia to ulceration and bleeding. Application site reactions occurring in ≥1% of patients were pain (4%), ulcer (3%), and irritation (3%). Application site reactions tended to occur early in treatment, were self-limited and only resulted in treatment discontinuation for 2% of patients. 5.9 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use FENTORA with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.10 MAO Inhibitors FENTORA is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.11 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] , FENTORA is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program.

Patients receiving ACTIQ concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cephalon, Inc., at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of ACTIQ has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of ACTIQ use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with ACTIQ are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of ACTIQ, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including ACTIQ are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of ACTIQ were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received ACTIQ for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of ACTIQ therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of ACTIQ that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest.

Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to ACTIQ. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ACTIQ (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING:RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL •Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) •Full and partially consumed ACTIQ units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“ACTIQ Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) •Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) •Titrate ACTIQ cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in ACTIQ. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to ACTIQ from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as ACTIQ and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. ACTIQ is NOT a generic version of Fentora®. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an ACTIQ prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and ACTIQ are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of ACTIQ compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of ACTIQ for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of ACTIQ should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that ACTIQ contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested ACTIQ. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3), and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. ACTIQ could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of ACTIQ with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of ACTIQ if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking ACTIQ of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate ACTIQ with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of ACTIQ may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer ACTIQ with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use ACTIQ with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors ACTIQ is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] , ACTIQ is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program.Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of ACTIQ, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: • Healthcare professionals, who prescribe ACTIQ for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. • To receive ACTIQ, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. • Pharmacies that dispense ACTIQ must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. • Wholesalers and distributors that distribute ACTIQ must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) 7.1 Metabolic Drug Interactions Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when Lazanda is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. CYP3A4 inhibitors The concomitant use of Lazanda with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving Lazanda who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors are to be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Increase dose conservatively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. CYP3A4 inducers The concomitant use of Lazanda with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of Lazanda. Patients receiving Lazanda who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers may experience sudden increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and are to be monitored for signs of increased Lazanda activity. Adjust the dose of Lazanda accordingly. 7.2 Non-metabolic Drug Interactions Agents used to treat Allergic Rhinitis The presence of allergic rhinitis is not expected to affect Lazanda absorption. However, co-administration of a vasoconstrictive nasal decongestant such as oxymetazoline to treat allergic rhinitis leads to lower peak plasma concentrations and a delayed Tmax of fentanyl that may cause Lazanda to be less effective in patients with allergic rhinitis who use such decongestants, thus potentially impairing pain management. Additionally, in view of the possibility that the titration of a patient while they are experiencing an acute episode of rhinitis could lead to incorrect dose identification (particularly if they are using a vasoconstrictive decongestant), titration under these circumstances must be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. MAO inhibitor Concomitant use of Lazanda with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuing an MAO inhibitor, is not recommended."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): vomiting, nausea, dizziness, pyrexia, and constipation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Depomed, Inc. at 1-866-458-6389 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Lazanda has been evaluated in a total of 523 opioid-tolerant patients with breakthrough cancer pain. The average duration of therapy in patients in the long-term study was 73 days, with 153 patients being treated for over 3 months. Patients continuing into the open-label extension period of the safety study have been treated for up to 26 months. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with Lazanda are typical of opioid side effects, such as nausea, constipation, somnolence, and headache. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The clinical trials of Lazanda were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain; all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone, or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 1 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received Lazanda for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of Lazanda therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse events are included regardless of causality or severity. Table 1 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign Lazanda a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) Do not convert patients to Lazanda from other fentanyl products on a mcg per mcg basis, or substitute a Lazanda prescription for another fentanyl product, such substitution may result in fatal overdose. (5.2) Lazanda bottles contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. (5.3, 16.2, 16.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.2, 5.4) Titrate Lazanda cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.2, 5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using Lazanda. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Lazanda and other Fentanyl Products Lazanda is NOT equivalent to other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of Lazanda relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing Lazanda to a patient, DO NOT convert from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to Lazanda from other fentanyl products are not currently available. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl). Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of Lazanda is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] When dispensing Lazanda to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Information for Patients and Their Caregivers Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that Lazanda contains medicine in an amount that could be fatal to a child. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused bottles in their child-resistant container and out of the reach of children at all times. Partially used bottles represent a special risk to children. As soon as they are no longer required, all used, unopened or partially used bottles must be completely emptied of accessible fentanyl solution by spraying the remaining contents into the carbon-lined pouch. The sealed pouch and the empty bottle should be put into the child-resistant container before discarding in the trash. Hands must be washed with soap and water immediately after handling the pouch. [see Storage and Handling (16.2) , Disposal of Lazanda (16.3) , and Patient/Caregiver Instructions (17) ]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must question patients and caregivers specifically about the presence of children in the home on a full-time or visiting basis and counsel accordingly regarding the dangers to children of inadvertent exposure to Lazanda. Lazanda could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of Lazanda with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Metabolic Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and may require adjustment of the dose of Lazanda. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking Lazanda of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, cautiously adjust the dose of Lazanda in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of Lazanda may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer Lazanda with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; only use opioids if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Use Lazanda with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors Lazanda is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. [see Non-metabolic Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ], Lazanda is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the TIRF REMS Access program.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS As with opioid agonists, the most common serious adverse reactions reported to occur with fentanyl are respiratory depression, apnea, rigidity, and bradycardia; if these remain untreated, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression or cardiac arrest could occur. Other adverse reactions that have been reported are hypertension, hypotension, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, emesis, diaphoresis, pruritus, urticarial, laryngospasm, and anaphylaxis. It has been reported that secondary rebound respiratory depression may occasionally occur postoperatively. Patients should be monitored for this possibility and appropriate countermeasures taken as necessary. When a tranquilizer is used with fentanyl citrate, the following adverse reactions can occur: chills and/or shivering, restlessness, and postoperative hallucinatory episodes (sometimes associated with transient periods of mental depression); extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonia, akathisia, and oculogyric crisis) have been observed up to 24 hours postoperatively. When they occur, extrapyramidal symptoms can usually be controlled with antiparkinson agents. Postoperative drowsiness is also frequently reported following the use of neuroleptics with fentanyl citrate. Cases of cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death have been reported following the use of fentanyl citrate with a neuroleptic agent."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Pre-Marketing Clinical Trial Experience The safety of fentanyl buccal tablets has been evaluated in 304 opioid tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. The average duration of therapy was 76 days with some patients being treated for over 12 months. The most commonly observed adverse events seen with fentanyl buccal tablets are typical of opioid side effects. Opioid side effects should be expected and managed accordingly. The clinical trials of fentanyl buccal tablets were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received fentanyl buccal tablets for breakthrough pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of fentanyl buccal tablets therapy or cancer-related symptoms. Table 5 lists, by maximum dose received, adverse events with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse events is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Table 5.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when OTFC is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings And Precautions (5.9)]. Monitor patients who begin or end therapy with potent inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 for signs of opioid toxicity. (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Enter section text here Most common adverse reactions during titration phase (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache. (6.1) Most common adverse reactions during treatment (frequency ≥5%): dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cephalon, Inc., at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of OTFC (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate) has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of OTFC use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with OTFC are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of OTFC, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including OTFC are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of OTFC were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received OTFC for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of OTFC therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of OTFC that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system. Table 1.

Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to OTFC. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OTFC (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING: IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION, DOSING, and POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.2) Full and partially consumed OTFC units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“OTFC Child Safety Kit”) (5.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate OTFC cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. (5.6) Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.7) 5.1 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of Fentora®. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage And Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Respiratory Depression As with all opioids, there is a risk of clinically significant respiratory depression in patients using OTFC. Accordingly, follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Respiratory depression may occur more readily when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that OTFC contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage And Handling (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) and the Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS As with other opioid agonists, the most common serious adverse reactions reported to occur with fentanyl are respiratory depression, apnea, rigidity, and bradycardia; if these remain untreated, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression or cardiac arrest could occur. Other adverse reactions that have been reported are hypertension, hypotension, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, emesis, diaphoresis, pruritus, urticarial, laryngospasm, and anaphylaxis. It has been reported that secondary rebound respiratory depression may occasionally occur postoperatively. Patients should be monitored for this possibility and appropriate countermeasures taken as necessary. When a tranquilizer is used with fentanyl citrate, the following adverse reactions can occur: chills and/or shivering, restlessness, and postoperative hallucinatory episodes (sometimes associated with transient periods of mental depression); extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonia, akathisia, and oculogyric crisis) have been observed up to 24 hours postoperatively. When they occur, extrapyramidal symptoms can usually be controlled with anti-parkinson agents. Postoperative drowsiness is also frequently reported following the use of neuroleptics with fentanyl citrate. Cases of cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death have been reported following the use of fentanyl citrate with a neuroleptic agent."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when OTFC is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings And Precautions (5.9)]. Monitor patients who begin or end therapy with potent inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 for signs of opioid toxicity. (5.4, 7)"

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions during titration phase (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache. (6.1) Most common adverse reactions during treatment (frequency ≥5%): dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cephalon, Inc., at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of OTFC (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate) has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of OTFC use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with OTFC are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of OTFC, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including OTFC are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of OTFC were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received OTFC for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of OTFC therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of OTFC that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system. Table 1.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OTFC (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING: IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION, DOSING, and POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.2) Full and partially consumed OTFC units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“OTFC Child Safety Kit”) (5.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) Titrate OTFC cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. (5.6) Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.7) 5.1 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of Fentora®. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage And Administration (2.2)]. 5.2 Respiratory Depression As with all opioids, there is a risk of clinically significant respiratory depression in patients using OTFC. Accordingly, follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Respiratory depression may occur more readily when opioids are given in conjunction with other agents that depress respiration. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that OTFC contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage And Handling (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1) and the Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Muscle relaxants: Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and IONSYS for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. ( 7.2) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid use of IONSYS in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. ( 7.4) Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics: Avoid use with IONSYS because they may reduce the analgesic effect of IONSYS or precipitate withdrawal. ( 7.5) 7.1 Central Nervous System Depressants The concomitant use of IONSYS with other central nervous system depressants including sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, phenothiazines, general anesthetics, other opioids, and alcohol can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Monitor patients receiving concomitant CNS depressants and IONSYS for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]. 7.2 Muscle Relaxants IONSYS may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of true skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and IONSYS for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected. 7.3 Drugs Affecting CYP3A4 Isoenzyme System Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Because the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may cause decreased clearance of fentanyl which could lead to an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations and result in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of 3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration with IONSYS is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. Inducers of CYP3A4 CYP450 3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of fentanyl and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who has developed physical dependence to fentanyl. If co-administration with IONSYS is necessary, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. After stopping the treatment of a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects, and may cause serious respiratory depression or death [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 7.4 Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors Avoid use of IONSYS in patients who would require the concomitant administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 14 days of stopping such a treatment because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 7.5 Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed agonist/antagonist (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) and partial agonist (buprenorphine) analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of IONSYS or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid the use of agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics in patients receiving IONSYS. 7.6 Diuretics IONSYS can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. IONSYS may also lead to acute retention of urine by causing spasm of the sphincter of the bladder, particularly in men with enlarged prostates. 7.7 Anticholinergics Anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity when used concurrently with IONSYS may result in increased risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastrointestinal motility when IONSYS is used concurrently with anticholinergic drugs."

ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Life-threatening respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] Addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)] Interactions with other CNS depressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)] Hypotensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10)] Gastrointestinal effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12)] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13)] Most common (frequency ≥ 2%) adverse reactions were headache, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, anemia, dizziness, application site reaction-erythema, pruritus, and urinary retention. ( 6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact The Medicines Company at 1-877-488-6835 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled and uncontrolled studies, the safety of IONSYS 40 mcg was evaluated in a total of 2114 patients with acute postoperative pain requiring opioid analgesia. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) in the placebo-controlled studies, regardless of relationship to study medication, are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions with Incidence ≥ 2% in Placebo-controlled Studies 1, 2, and 3 (N=791; 24 Hour Duration) Adverse Reactions IONSYS (n=475) Placebo (n=316) Body as a Whole Headache 9% 7% Cardiovascular System Hypotension 2% <1% Digestive System Nausea 39% 22% Vomiting 12% 6% Hemic and Lymphatic System Anemia 3% <1% Nervous System Dizziness 3% 1% Skin System Application site reaction- Erythema 14% 2% Pruritus 6% <1% Urogenital System Urinary retention 3% <1% NOTE: Patients reported as having “Nausea and vomiting” are included in “Nausea” and \"Vomiting” in Table 1. Other Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions that were reported (excluding adverse reactions listed in Table 1) in 4 active comparator trials vs. IV PCA morphine in patients treated with IONSYS (n=1288) are described below: Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, back pain, extremity pain, chest pain, chills, abdomen enlarged, asthenia, abscess, hypothermia Cardiovascular System: syncope, postural hypotension, vasodilation, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tachycardia, bigeminy, arrhythmia, myocardial infarct Digestive System: constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, ileus, dry mouth, diarrhea Metabolic and Nutritional System: peripheral edema, healing abnormal, edema, dehydration Musculoskeletal System: leg cramps and myalgia Nervous System: insomnia, anxiety, somnolence, confusion, paresthesia, hypesthesia, nervousness, agitation, abnormal dreams, tremor Respiratory System: hypoxia, hypoventilation, dyspnea, apnea, cough increased, asthma, hiccup, atelectasis, rhinitis, hyperventilation Skin System: application site reactions including: itching, vesicles, papules/pustules, edema, pain, burning, dry and flaky skin, and vesiculobullous rash, wound site oozing/bleeding, wound site inflammation/erythema, rash, sweating Special Senses: abnormal vision-blurred vision Urogenital System: urination impaired, hematuria, urinary tract infection, urinary urgency, dysuria Scheduled observation of the skin approximately 24 hours after IONSYS removal was included in several studies. Some redness at the skin sites was observed in approximately 60% of patients at this observation. The skin findings included erythema, edema, and papules. The majority of these events were categorized as mild. Two patients were noted to have hyperpigmentation lasting 2 ‑ 3 weeks at the application site. Three patients noted a rectangular mark at the application site, which persisted for up to 3 months after study completion. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of IONSYS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most commonly observed events were related to application site reactions which included urticaria, application site discharge, erosion, hyperesthesia, pustules, rash and scab, application site bleeding, application site infection, and necrosis."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interactions with CNS depressants: Concomitant use may cause hypotension, profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death. Monitor patients closely if co-administration is required. ( 5.1, 5.4, 7.1) Risk of injury during MRI: IONSYS contains metal parts and must be removed before an MRI. ( 5.5) Risk of use during other procedures (cardioversion, defibrillation, X-ray, CT, diathermy): Remove IONSYS before these procedures. ( 5.6) Topical skin reactions: If reaction is severe, discontinue IONSYS. ( 5.7) Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients, and those with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk of life-threatening respiratory depression. ( 5.8, 5.9) Hypotension: Monitor during dose initiation. Avoid use of IONSYS in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10) Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of IONSYS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. Opioids may obscure clinical course in patients with head injury. ( 5.11) Patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis: Monitor for worsening symptoms. ( 5.12) Increased risk of seizures in patients with seizure disorders: Monitor for worsened seizure control during IONSYS therapy. ( 5.13) Bradycardia: Closely monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias. ( 5.14) 5.1 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, including fentanyl, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, including fentanyl, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10.2)]. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. The use of concomitant CNS-active drugs increases the risk of respiratory depression and requires special patient care and observation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]. Keep IONSYS out of reach of children at all times. Accidental exposure to an intact IONSYS or to its components, through contact with skin or mucous membranes can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. Following accidental contact with IONSYS or its components, immediately rinse the affected area thoroughly with water. Do not use soap, alcohol, or other solvent because they may enhance the drug’s ability to penetrate the skin. The individual exposed should be monitored for signs of respiratory or central nervous system depression. If IONSYS is not handled correctly using gloves, healthcare professionals are at risk of accidental exposure to a fatal overdose of fentanyl. IONSYS is for hospital use only. Use of IONSYS outside of the hospital setting can lead to accidental exposure in others for whom it is not prescribed, causing fatal respiratory depression. Prior to the patient leaving the hospital, medical personnel must remove IONSYS and dispose of it properly. 5.2 IONSYS Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program IONSYS is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the IONSYS REMS Program because of the risk of respiratory depression resulting from accidental exposure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]. Notable requirements of the IONSYS REMS Program include the following: Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer IONSYS must be certified in the IONSYS REMS program and comply with the REMS requirements. Hospitals must only dispense IONSYS for hospital use. Further information about the IONSYS REMS Program is available at www.ionsysrems.com, or by calling 1-877-488-6835. 5.3 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse IONSYS contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Fentanyl can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing IONSYS in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Concerns about addiction, abuse, and misuse, however, should not prevent the proper management of pain. Assess each patient’s risk for opioid abuse or addiction prior to prescribing IONSYS. The risk for opioid abuse is increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with opioids; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because these drugs carry a risk for addiction even under appropriate medical use. Contact local State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.4 Interactions with Central Nervous System Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, coma, respiratory depression, and death may result if IONSYS is used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, other opioids). When considering the use of IONSYS in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patient’s response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, evaluate the patient’s use of alcohol or illicit drugs that cause CNS depression [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]. 5.5 Risk of Injury during Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Procedure The IONSYS device is considered MR Unsafe. IONSYS contains metal parts and must be removed and properly disposed of before an MRI procedure to avoid injury to the patient and damage to IONSYS. It is unknown if exposure to an MRI procedure increases release of fentanyl from IONSYS. Monitor any patients wearing IONSYS with inadvertent exposure to an MRI for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression. 5.6 Risk of IONSYS Use during Other Procedures or Near Certain Equipment Cardioversion, Defibrillation, Radiographic Imaging Procedures other than MRI, or Diathermy Use of IONSYS during cardioversion, defibrillation, X-ray, CT, or diathermy can damage IONSYS from the strong electromagnetic fields set up by these procedures. IONSYS contains radio-opaque components and may interfere with an X-ray image or CT scan. Remove and properly dispose of IONSYS prior to cardioversion, defibrillation, X-ray, CT, or diathermy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3, 2.4)]. Synthetic Materials and Electronic Security Systems Avoid contact with synthetic materials (such as carpeted flooring) to reduce the possibility of electrostatic discharge and damage to IONSYS. Avoid exposing IONSYS to electronic security systems to reduce the possibility of damage to IONSYS. See IONSYS Important Device Instructions for additional details. Communications Equipment and Radio Frequency Identification Transmitters Use of IONSYS near communications equipment (e.g., base stations for radio telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast Radio) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transmitters can damage IONSYS. Depending on the rated maximum output power and frequency of the transmitter, the recommended separation distance between IONSYS and communications equipment or the RFID transmitter ranges between 0.12 and 23 meters. See IONSYS Important Device Instructions for detailed instructions regarding recommended separation distances. Other Electromechanical Devices Including Pacemakers or Electrical Monitoring Equipment The low-level electrical current provided by IONSYS does not result in electromagnetic interference with other electromechanical devices like pacemakers or electrical monitoring equipment. If exposure to the procedures listed above, electronic security systems, electrostatic discharge, communications equipment, or RFID transmitters occurs, and if IONSYS does not appear to function normally [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3)], remove IONSYS and replace with a new IONSYS. See IONSYS Important Device Instructions for additional details including information on troubleshooting device malfunction and electromagnetic compatibility. 5.7 Topical Skin Reactions Topical skin reactions (erythema, sweating, vesicles, papules/pustules) may occur with use of IONSYS and are typically limited to the application site area. If a severe skin reaction is observed, remove IONSYS and discontinue further use. 5.8 Use in Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely; especially when IONSYS is used concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]. 5.9 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Monitor patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression for respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with IONSYS, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of IONSYS may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]. Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible. 5.10 Hypotensive Effect IONSYS may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating IONSYS. Avoid the use of IONSYS in patients with circulatory shock as IONSYS may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. 5.11 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure IONSYS is not suitable for use in patients who are not alert and able to follow directions. Monitor patients using IONSYS who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with IONSYS. IONSYS may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids, including IONSYS, may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of IONSYS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions IONSYS is contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. Fentanyl may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms. Opioids, including IONSYS, may cause increases in serum amylase. 5.13 Use in Patients with Convulsive or Seizure Disorders IONSYS may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during IONSYS therapy. 5.14 Bradycardia IONSYS may produce bradycardia in some patients. Monitor patients with bradyarrhythmias closely for changes in heart rate, particularly when initiating therapy with IONSYS. 5.15 Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Since the CYP3A4 isoenzyme plays a major role in the metabolism of fentanyl, drugs that alter CYP3A4 activity may cause changes in clearance of fentanyl which could lead to changes in fentanyl plasma concentrations. The concomitant use of IONSYS with a CYP3A4 inhibitor (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, nefazadone, amiodarone, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil) may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Carefully monitor patients receiving IONSYS and any CYP3A4 inhibitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression for an extended period of time, and make dosage adjustments as needed. If co-administration is necessary, caution is advised when initiating IONSYS treatment in patients currently taking, or discontinuing, CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Evaluate these patients at frequent intervals and consider dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 5.16 Hepatic Impairment Insufficient data are available on the use of IONSYS in patients with impaired hepatic function. Since fentanyl is eliminated by hepatic metabolism and fentanyl clearance may decrease in patients with hepatic disease, monitor patients with hepatic impairment for signs of sedation and respiratory depression [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. 5.17 Renal Impairment A clinical pharmacology study with intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing kidney transplantation has shown that patients with high blood urea nitrogen level had low fentanyl clearance. Monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of OTFC with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and nefazodone) or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug effects including fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving OTFC concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dosage increase should be done conservatively. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice decrease CYP3A4 activity, increasing blood concentrations of fentanyl, thus should be avoided. Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4 activity may have the opposite effects. Concomitant use of OTFC with an MAO inhibitor, or within 14 days of discontinuation, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. •See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (frequency ≥5%): nausea, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, asthenia, and headache, dyspnea, constipation, anxiety, confusion, depression, rash, and insomnia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cephalon, Inc., at 1-800-896-5855 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The safety of Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) has been evaluated in 257 opioid-tolerant chronic cancer pain patients. The duration of OTFC use varied during the open-label study. Some patients were followed for over 21 months. The average duration of therapy in the open-label study was 129 days. The adverse reactions seen with OTFC are typical opioid side effects. Frequently, these adverse reactions will cease or decrease in intensity with continued use of OTFC, as the patient is titrated to the proper dose. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including OTFC are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression. Because the clinical trials of OTFC were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating breakthrough cancer pain, all patients were also taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent cancer pain. The adverse event data presented here reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing each adverse effect among patients who received OTFC for breakthrough cancer pain along with a concomitant opioid for persistent cancer pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of OTFC therapy, or cancer-related symptoms. Adverse reactions are included regardless of causality or severity. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Three short-term clinical trials with similar titration schemes were conducted in 257 patients with malignancy and breakthrough cancer pain. Data are available for 254 of these patients. The goal of titration in these trials was to find the dose of OTFC that provided adequate analgesia with acceptable side effects (successful dose). Patients were titrated from a low dose to a successful dose in a manner similar to current titration dosing guidelines. Table 1 lists, by dose groups, adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 1% or greater that occurred during titration and are commonly associated with opioid administration or are of particular clinical interest. The ability to assign a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies. Adverse reactions are listed in descending order of frequency within each body system. Table 1.

Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to OTFC. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OTFC (which contains approximately 2 grams of sugar per unit): Digestive: Dental decay of varying severity including dental caries, tooth loss, and gum line erosion. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site reactions including irritation, pain, and ulcer."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNING: RISK OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, MEDICATION ERRORS, ABUSE POTENTIAL •Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1) •Full and partially consumed OTFC units contain medicine that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. Interim safe storage container available (“OTFC Child Safety Kit”). (5.3) •Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4) •Titrate OTFC cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl, the active ingredient in Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC). Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the “sighing” pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 Important Information Regarding Prescribing and Dispensing When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to OTFC from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as OTFC and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. OTFC is NOT a generic version of Fentora®. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute an OTFC prescription for a Fentora prescription under any circumstances. Fentora and OTFC are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of OTFC compared to other fentanyl products including Fentora that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of OTFC for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose. There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products. (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of OTFC should always be 200 mcg. Each patient should be individually titrated to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that OTFC contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested OTFC. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3), and Medication Guide]. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. OTFC could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of OTFC with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects. Consideration should be given to adjusting the dose of OTFC if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking OTFC of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause respiratory depression, titrate OTFC with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or preexisting medical conditions predisposing them to respiratory depression. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of OTFC may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer OTFC with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use OTFC with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors OTFC is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], OTFC is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of OTFC, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required. Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are: • Healthcare professionals, who prescribe OTFC for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements. • To receive OTFC, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. • Pharmacies that dispense OTFC must enroll in the program, and agree to comply with the REMS requirements. • Wholesalers and distributors that distribute OTFC must enroll in the program, and distribute only to authorized pharmacies. Further information, including a list of qualified pharmacies/distributors, is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.",

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fentanyl is metabolized mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4); therefore potential interactions may occur when ABSTRAL is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity. The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, verapamil, or cimetidine) may result in a potentially dangerous increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Patients receiving ABSTRAL who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, CYP3A4 inhibitors need to be carefully monitored for signs of opioid toxicity over an extended period of time. Increase dosage conservatively. The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, glucocorticoids, modafinil, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pioglitazone, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, or troglitazone) may result in a decrease in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could decrease the efficacy of ABSTRAL. Patients receiving ABSTRAL who stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, CYP3A4 inducers need to be monitored for signs of increased ABSTRAL activity and the dose of ABSTRAL must be adjusted accordingly.

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (total frequency ≥ 3%): nausea, somnolence, headache, and constipation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Galena Biopharma, Inc. at 1-888-227-8725 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/ medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ABSTRAL has been evaluated in 311 opioid-tolerant cancer patients with breakthrough pain. Two hundred and seventy (270) of these patients were treated in multiple-dose studies. The duration of therapy for patients in multiple-dose studies ranged from 1-405 days with an average duration of 131 days and with 44 patients treated for at least 12 months. The most commonly observed adverse reactions with ABSTRAL include typical opioid adverse reactions, such as nausea, constipation, somnolence and headache. Expect opioid side effects and manage them accordingly. The clinical trials of ABSTRAL were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating patients with cancer and breakthrough pain; all patients were taking concomitant opioids, such as sustained-release morphine, sustained-release oxycodone or transdermal fentanyl, for their persistent pain. The adverse reaction data presented in Table 2 reflect the actual percentage of patients experiencing reactions among patients who received ABSTRAL for breakthrough pain along with concomitant opioid use for persistent pain. There has been no attempt to correct for concomitant use of other opioids, duration of ABSTRAL therapy or cancer-related symptoms. Table 2 lists adverse reactions with an overall frequency of 5% or greater within the total population that occurred during titration by maximum dose received. The ability to assign ABSTRAL a dose-response relationship to these adverse reactions is limited by the titration schemes used in these studies.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed Warning - WARNINGS: IMPORTANCE OF PROPER PATIENT SELECTION and POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE Clinically significant respiratory and CNS depression can occur. Monitor patients accordingly. (5.1, 5.4) Do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from another fentanyl product to ABSTRAL. (5.2) ABSTRAL contains fentanyl in a dose that can be fatal to a child. Ensure proper storage and disposal. (5.3, 16.3) Use with other CNS depressants and potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may increase depressant effects including hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation. Consider dosage adjustments if warranted. (5.4, 7) Titrate ABSTRAL cautiously in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation, and in patients susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Hypoventilation (Respiratory Depression) Serious or fatal respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses in patients using ABSTRAL. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in patients with underlying respiratory disorders and elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses, including ABSTRAL, in opioid non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid- induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous. 5.2 ABSTRAL and Other Fentanyl Products ABSTRAL is NOT equivalent to all other fentanyl products used to treat breakthrough pain on a mcg per mcg basis. There are differences in the pharmacokinetics of ABSTRAL relative to other fentanyl products which could potentially result in clinically important differences in the amount of fentanyl absorbed and could result in a fatal overdose. When prescribing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT convert on a mcg to mcg basis from other fentanyl products. Directions for safely converting patients to ABSTRAL from other fentanyl products are not currently available except for Actiq [see Conversion from Actiq (2.2) ]. This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl. Therefore, for opioid-tolerant patients starting treatment for breakthrough pain, the initial dose of ABSTRAL is 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.1)] When dispensing ABSTRAL to a patient, DO NOT substitute it for any other fentanyl product prescription. 5.3 Patient/Caregiver Instructions Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that ABSTRAL contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Even though ABSTRAL is provided in child-resistant packaging, patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep tablets out of the reach of children. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1, 17.2)]. Taking ABSTRAL could be fatal in individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant. Physicians and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure. 5.4 Additive CNS Depressant Effects The concomitant use of ABSTRAL with other CNS depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating antihistamines, and alcoholic beverages may produce increased depressant effects (e.g., hypoventilation, hypotension, and profound sedation). Concomitant use with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, and certain protease inhibitors) may increase fentanyl levels, resulting in increased depressant effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients on concomitant CNS depressants must be monitored for a change in opioid effects and the dose of ABSTRAL adjusted, if warranted. 5.5 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking ABSTRAL of these dangers and counsel them accordingly. 5.6 Chronic Pulmonary Disease Because potent opioids can cause hypoventilation, titrate ABSTRAL with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation. In such patients, even normal therapeutic doses of ABSTRAL may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure. 5.7 Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure Administer ABSTRAL with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury; use only if clinically warranted. 5.8 Cardiac Disease Intravenous administration of fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use ABSTRAL with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias. 5.9 MAO Inhibitors ABSTRAL is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAO inhibitors within the past 14 days. Severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 5.10 Transmucosal immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)], ABSTRAL is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program.
