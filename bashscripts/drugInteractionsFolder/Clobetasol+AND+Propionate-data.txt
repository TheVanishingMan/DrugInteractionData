(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 orwww.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In controlled clinical trials involving 821 subjects exposed to Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam and vehicle foam, the pooled incidence of local adverse reactions in trials for atopic dermatitis and psoriasis with Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam was 1.9% for application site atrophy and 1.6% for application site reaction. Most local adverse events were rated as mild to moderate and they were not affected by age, race, or gender. The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, irritation, striae, and miliaria. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate. Cushing’s syndrome has been reported in infants and adults as a result of prolonged use of topical clobetasol propionate formulations. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clobetasol formulations: erythema, pruritus, burning, alopecia, and dryness."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam has been shown to suppress the HPA axis. Systemic absorption of Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam may produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmask latent diabetes. (5.1) •Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. (5.1) •Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. (5.1) •High potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, and liver failure may predispose patients to HPA axis suppression. (5.1) •Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) •The propellant in Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam is flammable. Avoid fire, flame, or smoking during and immediately following application. (5.4) 5.1 Effects on Endocrine System Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Systemic absorption of Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion has caused reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. Use of Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam for longer than 2 weeks may suppress the immune system. [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In a trial including 37 subjects aged 12 and older with at least 30% body surface area (BSA), adrenal suppression was identified in 6 out of 37 subjects (16.2%) after 2 weeks of treatment with Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than 1 corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses because of their larger skin surface- to-body mass ratios. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. If irritation develops, treatment with Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists, Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.4 Flammable Contents The propellant in Clobetasol Propionate Emulsion Foam is flammable. Avoid fire, flame, or smoking during and immediately following application. Do not puncture and/or incinerate the containers. Do not expose containers to heat and/or store at temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis at the lowest doses tested. (5.1) Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. (5.1) Systemic absorption may require periodic evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Modify use if HPA axis suppression develops. (5.1) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions include: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria. (5.2) 5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has caused reversible adrenal suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. The effect of Clobetasol Propionate Lotion, 0.05% on HPA axis function was compared to clobetasol propionate cream 0.05% (Temovate E® Emollient, 0.05%) in adults in two trials, one for psoriasis and one for atopic dermatitis. In total, 8 of 10 evaluable subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis experienced adrenal suppression following 4 weeks of Clobetasol Propionate Lotion, 0.05% therapy (treatment beyond 4 consecutive weeks is not recommended in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis). In follow-up testing, 1 of 2 subjects remained suppressed after 8 days. In this comparative trial, for clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% there were 3 of 10 evaluable subjects with HPA axis suppression. Furthermore, 5 of 9 evaluable subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experienced adrenal suppression following 2 weeks of Clobetasol Propionate Lotion, 0.05% therapy (treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis). Of the 3 subjects that had follow-up testing, one subjects failed to recover adrenal function 7 days post-treatment. For subjects treated with clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05%, 4 of 9 evaluable subjects experienced adrenal suppression following 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 2 subjects that had follow-up testing, both recovered adrenal function 7 days post-treatment. The proportion of subjects suppressed may be underestimated because the adrenal glands were stimulated weekly with cosyntropin in these trials. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. Use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended due to numerically high rates of HPA axis suppression [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae, miliaria, skin atrophy and telangiectasia. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Clobetasol propionate is not recommended in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea or perioral dermatitis. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections In the presence of dermatologic infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Clobetasol Propionate Lotion, 0.05%, should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled."

(5.4) 5.1 Effects on Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% (emulsion) has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Systemic absorption of clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% (emulsion) has caused reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. Use of Clobetasol Propionate Foam, 0.05% (Emulsion) for longer than 2 weeks may suppress the immune system [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. In a trial including 37 subjects 12 years and older with at least 30% body surface area (BSA), adrenal suppression was identified in 6 out of 37 subjects (16.2%) after 2 weeks of treatment with clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% (emulsion) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2.)]. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of Clobetasol Propionate Foam, 0.05% (Emulsion) may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure.

Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than 1 corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses because of their larger skin surface-to-body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation.

[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Clobetasol propionate is not recommended in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea or perioral dermatitis. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed with patch testing. If irritation develops, Temovate® E should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Temovate® E should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS OLUX-E Foam has been shown to suppress the HPA axis. Systemic absorption of OLUX-E Foam may produce reversible HPA axis suppression, Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmask latent diabetes. (5.1) Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. (5.1) Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. (5.1) High potency corticosteroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, and liver failure may predispose patients to HPA axis suppression. (5.1) Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) The propellant in OLUX-E Foam is flammable. Avoid fire, flame, or smoking during and immediately following application. (5.4)) 5.1 Effects on Endocrine System OLUX-E Foam has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Systemic absorption of OLUX-E has caused reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. Use of OLUX-E Foam for longer than 2 weeks may suppress the immune system. [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. In a trial including 37 subjects aged 12 years and older with at least 30% body surface area (BSA), adrenal suppression was identified in 6 out of 37 subjects (16.2%) after 2 weeks of treatment with OLUX-E. [see Clinical Pharmacology(12.2)]. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of OLUX-E may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than 1 corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses because of their larger skin surface- to-body mass ratios. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. If irritation develops, treatment with OLUX-E Foam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists, OLUX-E Foam should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.4 Flammable Contents The propellant in OLUX-E Foam is flammable. Avoid fire, flame, or smoking during and immediately following application. Do not puncture and/or incinerate the containers. Do not expose containers to heat and/or store at temperatures above 120°F (49°C)."

These reactions include: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypertrichosis, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria. (5.2) 5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at doses as low as 2 grams per day. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. In a study including 12 subjects ages 18 years and older with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis involving at least 30% body surface area (BSA), adrenal suppression was identified in 3 out of 12 subjects (25%) following 1 week of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Clobetasol propionate is not recommended in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea or perioral dermatitis. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed with patch testing. If irritation develops, clobetasol propionate emollient cream, 0.05% should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of clobetasol propionate emollient cream, 0.05% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled."

The most frequent adverse events reported for Cormax Scalp Application have been local and have included burning and/or stinging sensation, which occurred in 29 of 294 patients; scalp pustules, which occurred in 3 of 294 patients; and tingling and folliculitis, each of which occurred in 2 of 294 patients. Less frequent adverse events were itching and tightness of the scalp, dermatitis, tenderness, headache, hair loss, and eye irritation, each of which occurred in 1 of 294 patients. The following local adverse reactions are reported infrequently when topical corticosteroids are used as recommended. These reactions are listed in an approximately decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible HPA axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. In rare instances, treatment (or withdrawal of treatment) of psoriasis with corticosteroids is thought to have exacerbated the disease or provoked the pustular form of the disease, so careful patient supervision is recommended.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested. (5.1) Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. (5.1) Systemic absorption may require periodic evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Modify use if HPA axis suppression develops. (5.1) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions include: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria. (5.2) Clobetasol Propionate Spray, 0.05% is flammable, keep away from heat or flame. (5.5) 5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. In studies evaluating the potential for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, using the Cosyntropin Stimulation Test, Clobetasol Propionate Spray, 0.05% demonstrated rates of suppression that were comparable after 2 and 4 weeks of twice-daily use (19% and 15-20%, respectively), in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (≥20% BSA). In these studies, HPA axis suppression was defined as serum cortisol level ≤18 μg/dL 30-min post cosyntropin stimulation [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ]. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Clobetasol Propionate Spray, 0.05% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. 5.5 Flammable Contents Clobetasol Propionate Spray, 0.05% is flammable; keep away from heat or flame."

(5.4) 5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. The effect of clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05% on HPA axis suppression was evaluated in one trial in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. In this trial, 5 of 12 evaluable subjects developed suppression of their HPA axis following 4 weeks of treatment with clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05% applied once daily for 15 minutes to a dry scalp before lathering and rinsing. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis at the lowest doses tested (5.1) Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. (5.1) Systemic absorption may require periodic evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Modify use if HPA axis suppression develops. (5.1) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids (5.1, 8.4) If irritation develops in the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Clobetasol Propionate Shampoo should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled (5.3) Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions include: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria. (5.4) 5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. The effect of Clobetasol Propionate Shampoo, 0.05% on HPA axis suppression was evaluated in one trial in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. In this trial, 5 of 12 evaluable subjects developed suppression of their HPA axis following 4 weeks of treatment with Clobetasol Propionate Shampoo, 0.05% applied once daily for 15 minutes to a dry scalp before lathering and rinsing. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.2 Allergic Contact Dermatitis If irritation develops, Clobetasol Propionate Shampoo, 0.05%, should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed with patch testing. 5.3 Concomitant Skin Infections In the presence of dermatologic infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Clobetasol Propionate Shampoo, 0.05%, should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. 5.4 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Clobetasol propionate is not recommended in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea or perioral dermatitis."

In total, 8 of 10 evaluable subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis experienced adrenal suppression following 4 weeks of Clobetasol Propionate Lotion, 0.05% therapy (treatment beyond 4 consecutive weeks is not recommended in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis). In follow-up testing, 1 of 2 subjects remained suppressed after 8 days. In this comparative trial, for clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% there were 3 of 10 evaluable subjects with HPA axis suppression. Furthermore, 5 of 9 evaluable subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experienced adrenal suppression following 2 weeks of Clobetasol Propionate Lotion, 0.05% therapy (treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis). Of the 3 subjects that had follow-up testing, one subject failed to recover adrenal function 7 days post-treatment. For subjects treated with clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05%, 4 of 9 evaluable subjects experienced adrenal suppression following 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 2 subjects that had follow-up testing, both recovered adrenal function 7 days post-treatment.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis at the lowest doses tested. (5.1) Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. (5.1) Systemic absorption may require periodic evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Modify use if HPA axis suppression develops. (5.1) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions include: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria. (5.2) 5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at the lowest doses tested. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has caused reversible adrenal suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. The effect of clobetasol propionate lotion, 0.05% on HPA axis function was compared to clobetasol propionate cream (emollient) 0.05% in adults in two trials, one for psoriasis and one for atopic dermatitis. In total, 8 of 10 evaluable subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis experienced adrenal suppression following 4 weeks of clobetasol propionate lotion, 0.05% therapy (treatment beyond 4 consecutive weeks is not recommended in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis). In followup testing, 1 of 2 subjects remained suppressed after 8 days. In this comparative trial, for clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% there were 3 of 10 evaluable subjects with HPA axis suppression. Furthermore, 5 of 9 evaluable subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experienced adrenal suppression following 2 weeks of clobetasol propionate lotion, 0.05% therapy (treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis). Of the 3 subjects that had follow-up testing, one subjects failed to recover adrenal function 7 days post-treatment. For subjects treated with clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05%, 4 of 9 evaluable subjects experienced adrenal suppression following 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 2 subjects that had follow-up testing, both recovered adrenal function 7 days post-treatment. The proportion of subjects suppressed may be underestimated because the adrenal glands were stimulated weekly with cosyntropin in these trials. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. Use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended due to numerically high rates of HPA axis suppression [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae, miliaria, skin atrophy and telangiectasia. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Clobetasol propionate is not recommended in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea or perioral dermatitis. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections In the presence of dermatologic infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of clobetasol propionate lotion, 0.05% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis doses as low as 2 grams per day. (5.1) Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. (5.1) Systemic absorption may require periodic evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Modify use if HPA axis suppression develops. (5.1) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, including clobetasol propionate. These reactions include: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypertrichosis, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, striae and miliaria. (5.2) 5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at doses as low as 2 grams per day. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. In a study including 12 subjects ages 18 years and older with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis involving at least 30% body surface area (BSA), adrenal suppression was identified in 3 out of 12 subjects (25%) following 1 week of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure. An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Clobetasol propionate is not recommended in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea or perioral dermatitis. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed with patch testing. If irritation develops, Clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% (emollient) should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% (emollient) should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled."
