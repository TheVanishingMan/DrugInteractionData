        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adults Fatal lactic acidosis has occurred in patients treated with stavudine in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Patients with suspected lactic acidosis should immediately suspend therapy with stavudine . Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis. Stavudine therapy has rarely been associated with motor weakness, occurring predominantly in the setting of lactic acidosis. If motor weakness develops, stavudine should be discontinued. Stavudine therapy has also been associated with peripheral sensory neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose related, and occurs more frequently in patients being treated with other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy (including didanosine), in patients with advanced HIV infection, or in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy. Patients should be monitored for the development of neuropathy, which is usually manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet or hands. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy. If symptoms resolve completely, patients may tolerate resumption of treatment at one-half the dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If neuropathy recurs after resumption, permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered. Selected clinical adverse events that occurred in adult patients receiving stavudine in a controlled monotherapy study (Study AI455-019) are provided in Table 7.

These events have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to stavudine, or a combination of these factors. Body as a Whole- abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (see PRECAUTIONS: Fat Redistribution ). Digestive Disorders- anorexia. Exocrine Gland Disorders- pancreatitis [including fatal cases (see WARNINGS )]. Hematologic Disorders- anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and macrocytosis. Liver- symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis (see WARNINGS ), hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders—diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal- myalgia. Nervous System - insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis, see WARNINGS ). Use with Didanosine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when stavudine used alone. Thus, patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions and serious laboratory abnormalities in pediatric patients from birth through adolescence were similar in type and frequency to those seen in adult patients (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use )."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coadministration of stavudine with zidovudine should be avoided. (7) Coadministration of stavudine and doxorubicin or ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. (7) Stavudine is unlikely to interact with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Zidovudine: Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with stavudine should be avoided. Doxorubicin: In vitro data indicate that the phosphorylation of stavudine is inhibited at relevant concentrations by doxorubicin. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with doxorubicin should be undertaken with caution. Ribavirin: In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. The clinical significance of the interaction with stavudine is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. No pharmacokinetic (eg, plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

[See Use in Specific Populations (8.4).] 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of stavudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to stavudine, or a combination of these factors. Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Digestive Disorders: anorexia. Exocrine Gland Disorders: pancreatitis, including fatal cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Hematologic Disorders: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and macrocytosis. Liver: symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders: lipoatrophy, lipodystrophy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal: myalgia. Nervous System: insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)]. Use with Didanosine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when stavudine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Suspend treatment with stavudine in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.1) Hepatic toxicity: May be severe, fatal. Consider interruption or discontinuation. Avoid use in combination with didanosine and hydroxyurea. Risk of hepatic decompensation exists when used in combination with interferon and ribavirin; closely monitor and consider discontinuation of stavudine. (5.2) Neurologic symptoms: Motor weakness, most often seen in the setting of lactic acidosis, may mimic Guillain-Barre syndrome; discontinue treatment. Monitor for peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe; treatment discontinuation should be considered. (5.3) Pancreatitis: Suspend treatment, resume with particular caution and close monitoring and avoid use in combination with didanosine. (5.4) Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat, monitor for signs and symptoms of lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy. Alternative antiretrovirals should be considered. (5.5) Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome. (5.6) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including stavudine and other antiretrovirals. Although relative rates of lactic acidosis have not been assessed in prospective well-controlled trials, longitudinal cohort and retrospective studies suggest that this infrequent event may be more often associated with antiretroviral combinations containing stavudine. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering stavudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases of lactic acidosis have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Generalized fatigue, digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss); respiratory symptoms (tachypnea and dyspnea); or neurologic symptoms, including motor weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] might be indicative of the development of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome. Treatment with stavudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of stavudine have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] Use with Interferon and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as stavudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Drug Interactions (7)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (eg, Child-Pugh >6) (see the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). 5.3 Neurologic Symptoms Motor weakness has been reported rarely in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy including stavudine. Most of these cases occurred in the setting of lactic acidosis. The evolution of motor weakness may mimic the clinical presentation of Guillain-Barre syndrome (including respiratory failure). If motor weakness develops, stavudine should be discontinued. Symptoms may continue or worsen following discontinuation of therapy. Peripheral sensory neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving stavudine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or in patients receiving other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy, including didanosine [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. If peripheral neuropathy develops permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy. 5.4 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of stavudine and didanosine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and close patient monitoring; avoid use in combination with didanosine. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In randomized controlled trials of treatment-naive patients, clinical lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy developed in a higher proportion of patients treated with stavudine compared to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans demonstrated overall limb fat loss in stavudine-treated patients compared to limb fat gain or no gain in patients treated with other nucleosides (abacavir, tenofovir, or zidovudine). The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy are cumulative over time with stavudine-containing regimens. In clinical trials, switching from stavudine to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir) resulted in increases in limb fat with modest to no improvements in clinical lipoatrophy. Patients receiving stavudine should be monitored for symptoms or signs of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy and questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy. Given the potential risks of using stavudine including lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy, a benefit-risk assessment for each patient should be made and an alternative antiretroviral should be considered 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including stavudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with doxorubicin should be undertaken with caution. Ribavirin: In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. The clinical significance of the interaction with stavudine is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. No pharmacokinetic (eg, plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. - Coadministration of stavudine with zidovudine should be avoided.

[See Use in Specific Populations (8.4). ] 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of stavudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to stavudine, or a combination of these factors. Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Digestive Disorders: anorexia. Exocrine Gland Disorders: pancreatitis, including fatal cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Hematologic Disorders: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and macrocytosis. Liver: symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders: lipoatrophy, lipodystrophy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ], diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal: myalgia. Nervous System: insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3 )]. Use with Didanosine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when stavudine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Suspend treatment with stavudine in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.1) - Hepatic toxicity: May be severe, fatal. Consider interruption or discontinuation. Avoid use in combination with didanosine and hydroxyurea. Risk of hepatic decompensation exists when used in combination with interferon and ribavirin; closely monitor and consider discontinuation of stavudine. (5.2) - Neurologic symptoms: Motor weakness, most often seen in the setting of lactic acidosis, may mimic Guillain-Barre syndrome; discontinue treatment. Monitor for peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe; treatment discontinuation should be considered. (5.3) - Pancreatitis: Suspend treatment, resume with particular caution and close monitoring and avoid use in combination with didanosine. (5.4) - Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat, monitor for signs and symptoms of lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy. Alternative antiretrovirals should be considered. (5.5) - Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome. (5.6) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including stavudine and other antiretrovirals. Although relative rates of lactic acidosis have not been assessed in prospective well-controlled trials, longitudinal cohort and retrospective studies suggest that this infrequent event may be more often associated with antiretroviral combinations containing stavudine. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering stavudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases of lactic acidosis have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Generalized fatigue, digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss); respiratory symptoms (tachypnea and dyspnea); or neurologic symptoms, including motor weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] might be indicative of the development of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome. Treatment with stavudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of stavudine have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided. [See Adverse Reactions (6) .] Use with Interferon and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as stavudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Drug Interactions (7) ], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (eg, Child-Pugh >6) (see the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). 5.3 Neurologic Symptoms Motor weakness has been reported rarely in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy including stavudine. Most of these cases occurred in the setting of lactic acidosis. The evolution of motor weakness may mimic the clinical presentation of Guillain-Barre syndrome (including respiratory failure). If motor weakness develops, stavudine should be discontinued. Symptoms may continue or worsen following discontinuation of therapy. Peripheral sensory neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving stavudine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or in patients receiving other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy, including didanosine [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Patients should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. If peripheral neuropathy develops permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy. 5.4 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of stavudine and didanosine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and close patient monitoring; avoid use in combination with didanosine. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In randomized controlled trials of treatment-naive patients, clinical lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy developed in a higher proportion of patients treated with stavudine compared to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans demonstrated overall limb fat loss in stavudine-treated patients compared to limb fat gain or no gain in patients treated with other nucleosides (abacavir, tenofovir, or zidovudine). The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy are cumulative over time with stavudine-containing regimens. In clinical trials, switching from stavudine to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir) resulted in increases in limb fat with modest to no improvements in clinical lipoatrophy. Patients receiving stavudine should be monitored for symptoms or signs of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy and questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy. Given the potential risks of using stavudine including lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy, a benefit-risk assessment for each patient should be made and an alternative antiretroviral should be considered. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including stavudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

Use with Interferon and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as stavudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Drug Interactions (7)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh > 6) (see the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). 5.3 Neurologic Symptoms Motor weakness has been reported rarely in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy including stavudine. Most of these cases occurred in the setting of lactic acidosis. The evolution of motor weakness may mimic the clinical presentation of Guillain-Barre syndrome (including respiratory failure). If motor weakness develops, stavudine should be discontinued. Symptoms may continue or worsen following discontinuation of therapy. Peripheral sensory neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving stavudine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or in patients receiving other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy, including didanosine [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. If peripheral neuropathy develops permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy. 5.4 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of stavudine and didanosine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and close patient monitoring; avoid use in combination with didanosine. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In randomized controlled trials of treatment-naive patients, clinical lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy developed in a higher proportion of patients treated with stavudine compared to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans demonstrated overall limb fat loss in stavudine-treated patients compared to limb fat gain or no gain in patients treated with other nucleosides (abacavir, tenofovir, or zidovudine). The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy are cumulative over time with stavudine-containing regimens. In clinical trials, switching from stavudine to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir) resulted in increases in limb fat with modest to no improvements in clinical lipoatrophy. Patients receiving stavudine should be monitored for symptoms or signs of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy and questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy. Given the potential risks of using stavudine including lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy, a benefit-risk assessment for each patient should be made and an alternative antiretroviral should be considered. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including stavudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adults Fatal lactic acidosis has occurred in patients treated with stavudine in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Patients with suspected lactic acidosis should immediately suspend therapy with stavudine . Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to stavudine, or a combination of these factors. Body as a Whole- abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (see PRECAUTIONS: Fat Redistribution ). Digestive Disorders- anorexia. Exocrine Gland Disorders- pancreatitis [including fatal cases (see WARNINGS )]. Hematologic Disorders- anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and macrocytosis. Liver- symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis (see WARNINGS ), hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders—diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal- myalgia. Nervous System - insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis, see WARNINGS ). Use with Didanosine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when stavudine used alone. Thus, patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions and serious laboratory abnormalities in pediatric patients from birth through adolescence were similar in type and frequency to those seen in adult patients (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use )."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Stavudine is unlikely to interact with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Zidovudine: Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with stavudine should be avoided. Doxorubicin: In vitro data indicate that the phosphorylation of stavudine is inhibited at relevant concentrations by doxorubicin. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with doxorubicin should be undertaken with caution. Ribavirin: In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine and zidovudine. The clinical significance of the interaction with stavudine is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. No pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n = 18), stavudine (n = 10) or zidovudine (n = 6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Coadministration of stavudine with zidovudine should be avoided. (7) Coadministration of stavudine and doxorubicin or ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. (7)"

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to stavudine, or a combination of these factors. Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever and redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Digestive Disorders: anorexia. Exocrine Gland Disorders: pancreatitis, including fatal cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Hematologic Disorders: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and macrocytosis. Liver: symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders: lipoatrophy, lipodystrophy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal: myalgia. Nervous System: insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)]. Use with Didanosine- and Hydroxyurea-based Regimens When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when stavudine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Suspend treatment with stavudine in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.1) Hepatic toxicity: May be severe, fatal. Consider interruption or discontinuation. Avoid use in combination with didanosine and hydroxyurea. Risk of hepatic decompensation exists when used in combination with interferon and ribavirin; closely monitor and consider discontinuation of stavudine. (5.2) Neurologic symptoms: Motor weakness, most often seen in the setting of lactic acidosis, may mimic Guillain-Barre syndrome; discontinue treatment. Monitor for peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe; treatment discontinuation should be considered. (5.3) Pancreatitis: Suspend treatment, resume with particular caution and close monitoring and avoid use in combination with didanosine. (5.4) Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat, monitor for signs and symptoms of lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy. Alternative antiretrovirals should be considered. (5.5) Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome. (5.6) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including stavudine and other antiretrovirals. Although relative rates of lactic acidosis have not been assessed in prospective well controlled trials, longitudinal cohort and retrospective studies suggest that this infrequent event may be more often associated with antiretroviral combinations containing stavudine. Female gender, obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering stavudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases of lactic acidosis have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Generalized fatigue, digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss); respiratory symptoms (tachypnea and dyspnea); or neurologic symptoms, including motor weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] might be indicative of the development of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome. Treatment with stavudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of stavudine have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during post-marketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine and stavudine. This combination should be avoided [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Use with Interferon and Ribavirin-based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as stavudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Drug Interactions (7)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh > 6) (see the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). 5.3 Neurologic Symptoms Motor weakness has been reported rarely in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy including stavudine. Most of these cases occurred in the setting of lactic acidosis. The evolution of motor weakness may mimic the clinical presentation of Guillain-Barre syndrome (including respiratory failure). If motor weakness develops, stavudine should be discontinued. Symptoms may continue or worsen following discontinuation of therapy. Peripheral sensory neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving stavudine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or in patients receiving other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy, including didanosine [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. If peripheral neuropathy develops permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy. 5.4 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of stavudine and didanosine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and close patient monitoring; avoid use in combination with didanosine. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In randomized controlled trials of treatment-naive patients, clinical lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy developed in a higher proportion of patients treated with stavudine compared to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans demonstrated overall limb fat loss in stavudine-treated patients compared to limb fat gain or no gain in patients treated with other nucleosides (abacavir, tenofovir or zidovudine). The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy are cumulative over time with stavudine-containing regimens. In clinical trials, switching from stavudine to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir) resulted in increases in limb fat with modest to no improvements in clinical lipoatrophy. Patients receiving stavudine should be monitored for symptoms or signs of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy and questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy. Given the potential risks of using stavudine including lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy, a benefit-risk assessment for each patient should be made and an alternative antiretroviral should be considered. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including stavudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to stavudine, or a combination of these factors. Body as a Whole- abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (see PRECAUTIONS: Fat Redistribution ). Digestive Disorders- anorexia. Exocrine Gland Disorders- pancreatitis [including fatal cases (see WARNINGS )]. Hematologic Disorders- anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and macrocytosis. Liver- symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis (see WARNINGS ), hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders—diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal- myalgia. Nervous System - insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis, see WARNINGS ). Use with Didanosine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when stavudine used alone. Thus, patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions and serious laboratory abnormalities in pediatric patients from birth through adolescence were similar in type and frequency to those seen in adult patients (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use )."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS ZERIT is unlikely to interact with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Zidovudine: Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with ZERIT (stavudine) should be avoided. Doxorubicin: In vitro data indicate that the phosphorylation of stavudine is inhibited at relevant concentrations by doxorubicin. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with doxorubicin should be undertaken with caution. Ribavirin: In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. The clinical significance of the interaction with stavudine is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. No pharmacokinetic (eg, plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. -Coadministration of ZERIT with zidovudine should be avoided.

[See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) .] 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of ZERIT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to ZERIT, or a combination of these factors. Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Digestive Disorders: anorexia. Exocrine Gland Disorders: pancreatitis, including fatal cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Hematologic Disorders: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and macrocytosis. Liver: symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders: lipoatrophy, lipodystrophy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ], diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal: myalgia. Nervous System: insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3) ]. Use with Didanosine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when stavudine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with ZERIT in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. The combination of ZERIT and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided.",
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Suspend treatment with ZERIT in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.1) - Hepatic toxicity: May be severe, fatal. Consider interruption or discontinuation. Avoid use in combination with didanosine and hydroxyurea. Risk of hepatic decompensation exists when used in combination with interferon and ribavirin; closely monitor and consider discontinuation of stavudine. (5.2) - Neurologic symptoms: Motor weakness, most often seen in the setting of lactic acidosis, may mimic Guillain-Barre syndrome; discontinue treatment. Monitor for peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe; treatment discontinuation should be considered. (5.3) - Pancreatitis: Suspend treatment, resume with particular caution and close monitoring and avoid use in combination with didanosine. (5.4) -Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat, monitor for signs and symptoms of lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy. Alternative antiretrovirals should be considered. (5.5) -Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome. (5.6) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including stavudine and other antiretrovirals. Although relative rates of lactic acidosis have not been assessed in prospective well-controlled trials, longitudinal cohort and retrospective studies suggest that this infrequent event may be more often associated with antiretroviral combinations containing stavudine. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering ZERIT to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases of lactic acidosis have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Generalized fatigue, digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss); respiratory symptoms (tachypnea and dyspnea); or neurologic symptoms, including motor weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] might be indicative of the development of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome. Treatment with ZERIT (stavudine) should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Permanent discontinuation of ZERIT should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of ZERIT have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided. [See Adverse Reactions (6) .] Use with Interferon and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as stavudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Drug Interactions (7) ], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (eg, Child-Pugh >6) (see the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). 5.3 Neurologic Symptoms Motor weakness has been reported rarely in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy including ZERIT. Most of these cases occurred in the setting of lactic acidosis. The evolution of motor weakness may mimic the clinical presentation of Guillain-Barre syndrome (including respiratory failure). If motor weakness develops, ZERIT should be discontinued. Symptoms may continue or worsen following discontinuation of therapy. Peripheral sensory neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving ZERIT therapy. Peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or in patients receiving other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy, including didanosine [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Patients should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. If peripheral neuropathy develops permanent discontinuation of ZERIT should be considered. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy. 5.4 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when ZERIT was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of ZERIT and didanosine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Reinstitution of ZERIT after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and close patient monitoring; avoid use in combination with didanosine. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In randomized controlled trials of treatment-naive patients, clinical lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy developed in a higher proportion of patients treated with stavudine compared to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans demonstrated overall limb fat loss in stavudine-treated patients compared to limb fat gain or no gain in patients treated with other nucleosides (abacavir, tenofovir, or zidovudine). The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy are cumulative over time with stavudine-containing regimens. In clinical trials, switching from stavudine to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir) resulted in increases in limb fat with modest to no improvements in clinical lipoatrophy. Patients receiving ZERIT should be monitored for symptoms or signs of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy and questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy. Given the potential risks of using ZERIT including lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy, a benefit-risk assessment for each patient should be made and an alternative antiretroviral should be considered. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including ZERIT. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adults Fatal lactic acidosis has occurred in patients treated with ZERIT in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Patients with suspected lactic acidosis should immediately suspend therapy with ZERIT. Permanent discontinuation of ZERIT should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis. ZERIT therapy has rarely been associated with motor weakness, occurring predominantly in the setting of lactic acidosis. If motor weakness develops, ZERIT should be discontinued. ZERIT therapy has also been associated with peripheral sensory neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose related, and occurs more frequently in patients being treated with other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy (including didanosine), in patients with advanced HIV infection, or in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy. Patients should be monitored for the development of neuropathy, which is usually manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet or hands. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy. If symptoms resolve completely, patients may tolerate resumption of treatment at one-half the dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

[See Use in Specific Populations (8.4).] 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of stavudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to stavudine, or a combination of these factors. Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Digestive Disorders: anorexia. Exocrine Gland Disorders: pancreatitis, including fatal cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Hematologic Disorders: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and macrocytosis. Liver: symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders: lipoatrophy, lipodystrophy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal: myalgia. Nervous System: insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)]. Use with Didanosine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when stavudine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis: Suspend treatment with stavudine in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.1) Hepatic Toxicity: May be severe, fatal. Consider interruption or discontinuation. Avoid use in combination with didanosine and hydroxyurea. Risk of hepatic decompensation exists when used in combination with interferon and ribavirin; closely monitor and consider discontinuation of stavudine. (5.2) Neurologic Symptoms: Motor weakness, most often seen in the setting of lactic acidosis, may mimic Guillain-Barre syndrome; discontinue treatment. Monitor for peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe; treatment discontinuation should be considered. (5.3) Pancreatitis: Suspend treatment, resume with particular caution and close monitoring and avoid use in combination with didanosine. (5.4) Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat, monitor for signs and symptoms of lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy. Alternative antiretrovirals should be considered. (5.5) Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome. (5.6) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including stavudine and other antiretrovirals. Although relative rates of lactic acidosis have not been assessed in prospective well-controlled trials, longitudinal cohort and retrospective studies suggest that this infrequent event may be more often associated with antiretroviral combinations containing stavudine. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering stavudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases of lactic acidosis have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Generalized fatigue, digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss); respiratory symptoms (tachypnea and dyspnea); or neurologic symptoms, including motor weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] might be indicative of the development of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome. Treatment with stavudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of stavudine have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] Use with Interferon and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as stavudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Drug Interactions (7)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6) (see the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). 5.3 Neurologic Symptoms Motor weakness has been reported rarely in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy including stavudine. Most of these cases occurred in the setting of lactic acidosis. The evolution of motor weakness may mimic the clinical presentation of Guillain-Barre syndrome (including respiratory failure). If motor weakness develops, stavudine should be discontinued. Symptoms may continue or worsen following discontinuation of therapy. Peripheral sensory neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving stavudine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or in patients receiving other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy, including didanosine [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. If peripheral neuropathy develops permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy. 5.4 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of stavudine and didanosine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and close patient monitoring; avoid use in combination with didanosine. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In randomized controlled trials of treatment-naive patients, clinical lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy developed in a higher proportion of patients treated with stavudine compared to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans demonstrated overall limb fat loss in stavudine-treated patients compared to limb fat gain or no gain in patients treated with other nucleosides (abacavir, tenofovir, or zidovudine). The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy are cumulative over time with stavudine-containing regimens. In clinical trials, switching from stavudine to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir) resulted in increases in limb fat with modest to no improvements in clinical lipoatrophy. Patients receiving stavudine should be monitored for symptoms or signs of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy and questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy. Given the potential risks of using stavudine including lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy, a benefit-risk assessment for each patient should be made and an alternative antiretroviral should be considered. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including stavudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and close patient monitoring; avoid use in combination with didanosine. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In randomized controlled trials of treatment-naive patients, clinical lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy developed in a higher proportion of patients treated with stavudine compared to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans demonstrated overall limb fat loss in stavudine-treated patients compared to limb fat gain or no gain in patients treated with other nucleosides (abacavir, tenofovir, or zidovudine). The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy are cumulative over time with stavudine-containing regimens. In clinical trials, switching from stavudine to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir) resulted in increases in limb fat with modest to no improvements in clinical lipoatrophy. Patients receiving stavudine should be monitored for symptoms or signs of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy and questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy. Given the potential risks of using stavudine including lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy, a benefit-risk assessment for each patient should be made and an alternative antiretroviral should be considered. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including stavudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Stavudine is unlikely to interact with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Coadministration of stavudine with zidovudine should be avoided. (7) Coadministration of stavudine and doxorubicin or ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. (7) Zidovudine: Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with stavudine should be avoided. Doxorubicin: In vitro data indicate that the phosphorylation of stavudine is inhibited at relevant concentrations by doxorubicin. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with doxorubicin should be undertaken with caution. Ribavirin: In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. The clinical significance of the interaction with stavudine is unknown; therefore, concomitant use of stavudine with ribavirin should be undertaken with caution. No pharmacokinetic (eg, plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]."

In adults, the most common adverse reactions are headache, diarrhea, neuropathy, rash, nausea, and vomiting. (6.1) Adverse reactions in pediatric patients were consistent with those seen in adults.

[See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) .] 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of stavudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to stavudine, or a combination of these factors. Body as a Whole: abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Digestive Disorders: anorexia. Exocrine Gland Disorders: pancreatitis, including fatal cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Hematologic Disorders: anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and macrocytosis. Liver: symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ], hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders: lipoatrophy, lipodystrophy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ], diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal: myalgia. Nervous System: insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3) ]. Use with Didanosine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when stavudine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Suspend treatment with stavudine in patients who develop clinical symptoms or signs with or without laboratory findings. (5.1) Hepatic toxicity: May be severe, fatal. Consider interruption or discontinuation. Avoid use in combination with didanosine and hydroxyurea. Risk of hepatic decompensation exists when used in combination with interferon and ribavirin; closely monitor and consider discontinuation of stavudine. (5.2) Neurologic symptoms: Motor weakness, most often seen in the setting of lactic acidosis, may mimic Guillain-Barre syndrome; discontinue treatment. Monitor for peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe; treatment discontinuation should be considered. (5.3) Pancreatitis: Suspend treatment, resume with particular caution and close monitoring and avoid use in combination with didanosine. (5.4) Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat, monitor for signs and symptoms of lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy. Alternative antiretrovirals should be considered. (5.5) Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome. (5.6) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including stavudine and other antiretrovirals. Although relative rates of lactic acidosis have not been assessed in prospective well-controlled trials, longitudinal cohort and retrospective studies suggest that this infrequent event may be more often associated with antiretroviral combinations containing stavudine. Female gender, obesity, and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of stavudine and didanosine with other antiretroviral agents. The combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Particular caution should be exercised when administering stavudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases of lactic acidosis have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Generalized fatigue, digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss); respiratory symptoms (tachypnea and dyspnea); or neurologic symptoms, including motor weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] might be indicative of the development of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome. Treatment with stavudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of symptomatic hyperlactatemia, lactic acidosis, or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity The safety and efficacy of stavudine have not been established in HIV-infected patients with significant underlying liver disease. During combination antiretroviral therapy, patients with preexisting liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities, including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events, and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. This combination should be avoided. [See Adverse Reactions (6).] Use with Interferon and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as stavudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic (eg, loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with stavudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Drug Interactions (7) ], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon and ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon with or without ribavirin and stavudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of stavudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (eg, Child-Pugh >6) (see the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). 5.3 Neurologic Symptoms Motor weakness has been reported rarely in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy including stavudine. Most of these cases occurred in the setting of lactic acidosis. The evolution of motor weakness may mimic the clinical presentation of Guillain-Barre syndrome (including respiratory failure). If motor weakness develops, stavudine should be discontinued. Symptoms may continue or worsen following discontinuation of therapy. Peripheral sensory neuropathy, manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, has been reported in patients receiving stavudine therapy. Peripheral neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose related and occurs more frequently in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or in patients receiving other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy, including didanosine [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Patients should be monitored for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. If peripheral neuropathy develops permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy. 5.4 Pancreatitis Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred during therapy when stavudine was part of a combination regimen that included didanosine in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, regardless of degree of immunosuppression. The combination of stavudine and didanosine and any other agents that are toxic to the pancreas should be suspended in patients with suspected pancreatitis. Reinstitution of stavudine after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be undertaken with particular caution and close patient monitoring; avoid use in combination with didanosine. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In randomized controlled trials of treatment-naive patients, clinical lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy developed in a higher proportion of patients treated with stavudine compared to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans demonstrated overall limb fat loss in stavudine-treated patients compared to limb fat gain or no gain in patients treated with other nucleosides (abacavir, tenofovir, or zidovudine). The incidence and severity of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy are cumulative over time with stavudine-containing regimens. In clinical trials, switching from stavudine to other nucleosides (tenofovir or abacavir) resulted in increases in limb fat with modest to no improvements in clinical lipoatrophy. Patients receiving stavudine should be monitored for symptoms or signs of lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy and questioned about body changes related to lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy. Given the potential risks of using stavudine including lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy, a benefit-risk assessment for each patient should be made and an alternative antiretroviral should be considered. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including stavudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) Zidovudine: Zidovudine competitively inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. Therefore, use of zidovudine in combination with stavudine should be avoided. Doxorubicin: In vitro data indicate that the phosphorylation of stavudine is inhibited at relevant concentrations by doxorubicin. Ribavirin: In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of lamivudine, stavudine, and zidovudine. However, no pharmacokinetic (e.g., plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations) or pharmacodynamic (e.g., loss of HIV/HCV virologic suppression) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine (n=18), stavudine (n=10), or zidovudine (n=6) were coadministered as part of a multi-drug regimen to HIV/HCV co-infected patients (see WARNINGS ). Stavudine does not inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4; therefore, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur with drugs metabolized through these pathways. Because stavudine is not protein-bound, it is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of protein-bound drugs.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adults Fatal lactic acidosis has occurred in patients treated with stavudine in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Patients with suspected lactic acidosis should immediately suspend therapy with stavudine. Permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered for patients with confirmed lactic acidosis. Stavudine therapy has rarely been associated with motor weakness, occurring predominantly in the setting of lactic acidosis. If motor weakness develops, stavudine should be discontinued. Stavudine therapy has also been associated with peripheral sensory neuropathy, which can be severe, is dose related, and occurs more frequently in patients being treated with other drugs that have been associated with neuropathy (including didanosine), in patients with advanced HIV infection, or in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy. Patients should be monitored for the development of neuropathy, which is usually manifested by numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet or hands. Stavudine-related peripheral neuropathy may resolve if therapy is withdrawn promptly. In some cases, symptoms may worsen temporarily following discontinuation of therapy. If symptoms resolve completely, patients may tolerate resumption of treatment at one-half the dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If neuropathy recurs after resumption, permanent discontinuation of stavudine should be considered.

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, frequency of reporting, causal connection to stavudine, or a combination of these factors. Body as a Whole —abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chills/fever, and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (see PRECAUTIONS: Fat Redistribution ). Digestive Disorders —anorexia. Exocrine Gland Disorders —pancreatitis [including fatal cases (see WARNINGS )]. Hematologic Disorders —anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and macrocytosis. Liver—symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis (see WARNINGS ), hepatitis and liver failure. Metabolic Disorders—diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Musculoskeletal—myalgia. Nervous System—insomnia, severe motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of lactic acidosis, see WARNINGS ). Use with Didanosine- and Hydroxyurea-Based Regimens When stavudine is used in combination with other agents with similar toxicities, the incidence of these toxicities may be higher than when stavudine is used alone. Thus, patients treated with stavudine in combination with didanosine, with or without hydroxyurea, may be at increased risk for pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, which may be fatal, and severe peripheral neuropathy. The combination of stavudine and hydroxyurea, with or without didanosine, should be avoided (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions and serious laboratory abnormalities in pediatric patients from birth through adolescence were similar in type and frequency to those seen in adult patients (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use )."
