        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fidaxomicin and its main metabolite, OP-1118, are substrates of the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. 7.1 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of multiple transporters, including P-gp. When cyclosporine was co-administered with DIFICID, plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 were significantly increased but remained in the ng/mL range [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 may also be decreased at the site of action (i.e., gastrointestinal tract) via P-gp inhibition; however, concomitant P-gp inhibitor use had no attributable effect on safety or treatment outcome of fidaxomicin-treated patients in controlled clinical trials. Based on these results, fidaxomicin may be co-administered with P-gp inhibitors and no dose adjustment is recommended."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions are nausea (11%), vomiting (7%), abdominal pain (6%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (4%), anemia (2%), and neutropenia (2%) (6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cubist Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-CUBIST-6 (1-877-282-4786) or FDA at (1-800-FDA-1088) or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of any other drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of DIFICID 200 mg tablets taken twice a day for 10 days was evaluated in 564 patients with CDAD in two active-comparator controlled trials with 86.7% of patients receiving a full course of treatment. Thirty-three patients receiving DIFICID (5.9%) withdrew from trials as a result of adverse reactions (AR). The types of AR resulting in withdrawal from the study varied considerably. Vomiting was the primary adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of dosing; this occurred at an incidence of 0.5% in both the fidaxomicin and vancomycin patients in Phase 3 studies. Table 1. Selected Adverse Reactions with an Incidence of ≥2% Reported in DIFICID Patients in Controlled Trials DIFICID (N=564) Vancomycin (N=583) System Organ Class Preferred Term n (%) n (%) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Anemia 14 (2%) 12 (2%) Neutropenia 14 (2%) 6 (1%) Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 62 (11%) 66 (11%) Vomiting 41 (7%) 37 (6%) Abdominal Pain 33 (6%) 23 (4%) Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage 20 (4%) 12 (2%) The following adverse reactions were reported in <2% of patients taking DIFICID tablets in controlled trials: Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness, dyspepsia, dysphagia, flatulence, intestinal obstruction, megacolon Investigations: increased blood alkaline phosphatase, decreased blood bicarbonate, increased hepatic enzymes, decreased platelet count Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: drug eruption, pruritus, rash 6.2 Post Marketing Experience Adverse reactions reported in the post marketing setting arise from a population of unknown size and are voluntary in nature. As such, reliability in estimating their frequency or in establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible. Hypersensitivity reactions (dyspnea, angioedema, rash, and pruritus) have been reported."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS DIFICID should not be used for systemic infections. (5.1) Acute hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, dyspnea, pruritus, and rash) have been reported. In the event of a severe reaction, discontinue DIFICID. (5.2) Development of drug-resistant bacteria: Only use DIFICID for infection proven or strongly suspected to be caused by C. difficile. (5.3) 5.1 Not for Systemic Infections Since there is minimal systemic absorption of fidaxomicin, DIFICID is not effective for treatment of systemic infections. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Acute hypersensitivity reactions, including dyspnea, rash pruritus, and angioedema of the mouth, throat, and face have been reported with fidaxomicin. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, DIFICID® should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Some patients with hypersensitivity reactions also reported a history of allergy to other macrolides. Physicians prescribing DIFICID to patients with a known macrolide allergy should be aware of the possibility of hypersensitivity reactions. 5.3 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing DIFICID in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected C. difficile infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."
