        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylactoid reactions (hypotension, pruritus, flushing, and diffuse rash) have been reported. (5.1) Induction of cardiovascular stress may be associated with myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction, cerebrovascular events and other serious adverse events. (5.2) 5.1 Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactoid reactions (hypotension, pruritus, flushing, and diffuse rash) have been reported. 5.2 Risks Associated with Stress Testing Perform stress testing only under the supervision of a qualified physician and in a laboratory equipped with appropriate resuscitation and support equipment. Patients suspected or known to have myocardial infarction or ischemia, require continuous clinical monitoring and treatment in accordance with safe, accepted procedures. Induction of cardiovascular stress might be associated with serious adverse events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension or hypertension, ECG abnormalities, chest pain, bronchoconstriction, and cerebrovascular events. Perform pharmacologic stress when indicated and in accordance with the pharmacologic stress agentâ€™s prescribing information. 5.3 Radiation Risks Thallous Chloride Tl 201 contributes to the cumulative radiation exposure. When considering administration of Thallous Chloride injection to women of child-bearing potential, consider the radiation risks for a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Use the lowest dose necessary for imaging and ensure safe handling to protect the patient and health care worker [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)(2.5)]. 5.4 Risk of Extravasation Inject Thallous Chloride Tl 201 strictly intravenously to avoid local tissue accumulation and irradiation."
