        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pharmacologic induction of cardiovascular stress may be associated with serious adverse events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction and cerebrovascular events (5.1). Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi has been rarely associated with acute severe allergic and anaphylactic events of angioedema and generalized urticaria. In some patients the allergic symptoms developed on the second injection during Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi imaging (5.1). Caution should be exercised and emergency equipment should be available when administering Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi (5.1). Before administering Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi patients should be asked about the possibility of allergic reactions to either drug (5.1). The contents of the vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi and are not to be administered directly to the patient without first undergoing the preparative procedure (5.2). 5.1 Warnings In studying patients in whom cardiac disease is known or suspected, care should be taken to assure continuous monitoring and treatment in accordance with safe, accepted clinical procedure. Infrequently, death has occurred 4 to 24 hours after Tc99m Sestamibi use and is usually associated with exercise stress testing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Pharmacologic induction of cardiovascular stress may be associated with serious adverse events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction and cerebrovascular events. Caution should be used when pharmacologic stress is selected as an alternative to exercise; it should be used when indicated and in accordance with the pharmacologic stress agents labeling.

Also, before administering Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi Injection, patients should be asked about the possibility of allergic reactions to the drug. 5.2 General Precautions The contents of the vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi and are not to be administered directly to the patient without first undergoing the preparative procedure. Radioactive drugs must be handled with care and appropriate safety measures should be used to minimize radiation exposure to clinical personnel. Also, care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure to the patients consistent with proper patient management. Contents of the kit before preparation are not radioactive. However, after the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc99m Injection is added, adequate shielding of the final preparation must be maintained. The components of the kit are sterile and non-pyrogenic. It is essential to follow directions carefully and to adhere to strict aseptic procedures during preparation. Technetium Tc99m labeling reactions depend on maintaining the stannous ion in the reduced state. Hence, Sodium Pertechnetate Tc99m Injection containing oxidants should not be used. Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi should not be used more than six hours after preparation. Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides. Stress testing should be performed only under the supervision of a qualified physician and in a laboratory equipped with appropriate resuscitation and support apparatus. The most frequent exercise stress test endpoints sufficient to stop the test reported during controlled studies (two-thirds were cardiac patients) were: Fatigue 35% Dyspnea 17% Chest Pain 16% ST-depression 7% Arrhythmia 1%"

However, after the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection is added, adequate shielding of the final preparation must be maintained. The components of the kit are sterile and non-pyrogenic. It is essential to follow directions carefully and to adhere to strict aseptic procedures during preparation. Technetium Tc 99m labeling reactions depend on maintaining the stannous ion in the reduced state. Hence, Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection containing oxidants should not be used. Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi should not be used more than six hours after preparation. Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides. Stress testing should be performed only under the supervision of a qualified physician and in a laboratory equipped with appropriate resuscitation and support apparatus. The most frequent exercise stress test endpoints sufficient to stop the test reported during controlled studies (two-thirds were cardiac patients) were: Fatigue 35% Dyspnea 17% Chest Pain 16% ST-depression 7% Arrhythmia 1%"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Pharmacologic induction of cardiovascular stress may be associated with serious adverse events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction and cerebrovascular events (5.1). •Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi has been rarely associated with acute severe allergic and anaphylactic events of angioedema and generalized urticaria. In some patients the allergic symptoms developed on the second injection during Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi imaging (5.1). •Caution should be exercised and emergency equipment should be available when administering Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi (5.1). •Before administering Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi patients should be asked about the possibility of allergic reactions to either drug (5.1). •The contents of the vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi and are not to be administered directly to the patient without first undergoing the preparative procedure (5.2). 5.1 Warnings In studying patients in whom cardiac disease is known or suspected, care should be taken to assure continuous monitoring and treatment in accordance with safe, accepted clinical procedure. Infrequently, death has occurred 4 to 24 hours after Tc 99m Sestamibi use and is usually associated with exercise stress testing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Pharmacologic induction of cardiovascular stress may be associated with serious adverse events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction and cerebrovascular events. Caution should be used when pharmacologic stress is selected as an alternative to exercise; it should be used when indicated and in accordance with the pharmacologic stress agent’s labeling. Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi has been rarely associated with acute severe allergic and anaphylactic events of angioedema and generalized urticaria. In some patients the allergic symptoms developed on the second injection during Tc 99m Sestamibi imaging. Patients who receive Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi for either myocardial or breast imaging are receiving the same drug. Caution should be exercised and emergency equipment should be available when administering Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi. Also, before administering Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi Injection, patients should be asked about the possibility of allergic reactions to the drug. 5.2 General Precautions The contents of the vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi and are not to be administered directly to the patient without first undergoing the preparative procedure. Radioactive drugs must be handled with care and appropriate safety measures should be used to minimize radiation exposure to clinical personnel. Also, care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure to the patients consistent with proper patient management. Contents of the kit before preparation are not radioactive. However, after the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection is added, adequate shielding of the final preparation must be maintained. The components of the kit are sterile and non-pyrogenic. It is essential to follow directions carefully and to adhere to strict aseptic procedures during preparation. Technetium Tc 99m labeling reactions depend on maintaining the stannous ion in the reduced state. Hence, Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection containing oxidants should not be used. Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi should not be used more than six hours after preparation. Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides. Stress testing should be performed only under the supervision of a qualified physician and in a laboratory equipped with appropriate resuscitation and support apparatus. The most frequent exercise stress test endpoints sufficient to stop the test reported during controlled studies (two-thirds were cardiac patients) were: Fatigue 35% Dyspnea 17% Chest Pain 16% ST-depression 7% Arrhythmia 1%"
