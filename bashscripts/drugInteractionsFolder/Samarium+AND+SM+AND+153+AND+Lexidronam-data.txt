        "ADVERSE EVENTS Adverse events were evaluated in a total of 580 patients who received QUADRAMET® in clinical trials. Of the 580 patients, there were 472 men and 108 women with a mean age of 66 (range 20 to 87). Of these patients, 472 (81%) had at least one adverse event. In a subgroup of 399 patients who received QUADRAMET® 1.0 mCi/kg, there were 23 deaths and 46 serious adverse events. The deaths occurred an average of 67 days (9 to 130) after QUADRAMET®. Serious events occurred an average of 46 days (1 - 118) after QUADRAMET®. Although most of the patient deaths and serious adverse events appear to be related to the underlying disease, the relationship of end stage disease, marrow invasion by cancer cells, previous myelotoxic treatment and QUADRAMET® toxicity can not be easily distinguished. In clinical studies, two patients with rapidly progressive prostate cancer developed thrombocytopenia and died 4 weeks after receiving QUADRAMET®. One of the patients showed evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); the other patient experienced a fatal cerebrovascular accident, with a suspicion of DIC. The relationship of the DIC to the bone marrow suppressive effect of Samarium is not known. Marrow toxicity occurred in 277 (48%) patients (See Warnings section). In controlled studies, 7% of patients receiving 1.0 mCi/kg QUADRAMET® (as compared to 6% of patients receiving placebo) reported a transient increase in bone pain shortly after injection (flare reaction). This was usually mild, self-limiting, and responded to analgesics. The most common adverse events observed in controlled clinical studies of QUADRAMET®, are given in Table 6.
