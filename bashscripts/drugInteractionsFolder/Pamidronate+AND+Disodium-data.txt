        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Studies Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Transient mild elevation of temperature by at least 1°C was noted 24 to 48 hours after administration of pamidronate disodium in 34% of patients in clinical trials. In the saline trial, 18% of patients had a temperature elevation of at least 1°C 24 to 48 hours after treatment. Drug-related local soft-tissue symptoms (redness, swelling or induration and pain on palpation) at the site of catheter insertion were most common in patients treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium. Symptomatic treatment resulted in rapid resolution in all patients. Rare cases of uveitis, iritis, scleritis, and episcleritis have been reported, including one case of scleritis, and one case of uveitis upon separate rechallenges. Five of 231 patients (2%) who received pamidronate disodium during the four U.S. controlled hypercalcemia clinical studies were reported to have had seizures, 2 of whom had preexisting seizure disorders. None of the seizures were considered to be drug-related by the investigators. However, a possible relationship between the drug and the occurrence of seizures cannot be ruled out. It should be noted that in the saline arm 1 patient (4%) had a seizure. There are no controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of 90-mg pamidronate disodium over 24 hours to 2 hours in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy. However, a comparison of data from separate clinical trials suggests that the overall safety profile in patients who received 90-mg pamidronate disodium over 24 hours is similar to those who received 90-mg pamidronate disodium over 2 hours. The only notable differences observed were an increase in the proportion of patients in the pamidronate disodium 24-hour group who experienced fluid overload and electrolyte/ mineral abnormalities. At least 15% of patients treated with pamidronate disodium for hypercalcemia of malignancy also experienced the following adverse events during a clinical trial: General: Fluid overload, generalized pain Cardiovascular: Hypertension Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection Musculoskeletal: Bone pain Laboratory Abnormality: Anemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia Many of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state. The following table lists the adverse experiences considered to be treatment-related during comparative, controlled U.S. trials.

Drug-related musculoskeletal pain and nervous system symptoms (dizziness, headache, paresthesia, increased sweating) were more common in patients with Paget’s disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium than in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy treated with the same dose. Adverse experiences considered to be related to trial drug, which occurred in at least 5% of patients with Paget’s disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium in two U.S. clinical trials, were fever, nausea, back pain, and bone pain. At least 10% of all pamidronate disodium-treated patients with Paget’s disease also experienced the following adverse experiences during clinical trials: Cardiovascular: Hypertension Musculoskeletal: Arthrosis, bone pain Nervous system: Headache Most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma The most commonly reported (>15%) adverse experiences occurred with similar frequencies in the pamidronate disodium-and placebo-treatment groups, and most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state or cancer therapy.

In the breast cancer trials, mild elevations of serum creatinine occurred in 18.5% of pamidronate disodium patients and 12.3% of placebo patients. Mineral and electrolyte disturbances, including hypocalcemia, were reported rarely and in similar percentages of pamidronate disodium-treated patients compared with those in the placebo group. The reported frequencies of hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia for pamidronate disodium-treated patients were 3.3%, 10.5%, 1.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, and for placebo-treated patients were 1.2%, 12%, 1.7%, and 4.5%, respectively. In previous hypercalcemia of malignancy trials, patients treated with pamidronate disodium (60 or 90 mg over 24 hours) developed electrolyte abnormalities more frequently (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Hypercalcemia of Malignancy). Arthralgias and myalgias were reported slightly more frequently in the pamidronate disodium group than in the placebo group (13.6% and 26% vs 10.8% and 20.1%, respectively). In multiple myeloma patients, there were five pamidronate disodium-related serious and unexpected adverse experiences. Four of these were reported during the 12-month extension of the multiple myeloma trial. Three of the reports were of worsening renal function developing in patients with progressive multiple myeloma or multiple myeloma-associated amyloidosis. The fourth report was the adult respiratory distress syndrome developing in a patient recovering from pneumonia and acute gangrenous cholecystitis. One pamidronate disodium-treated patient experienced an allergic reaction characterized by swollen and itchy eyes, runny nose, and scratchy throat within 24 hours after the sixth infusion. In the breast cancer trials, there were four pamidronate disodium-related adverse experiences, all moderate in severity, that caused a patient to discontinue participation in the trial. One was due to interstitial pneumonitis, another to malaise and dyspnea. One pamidronate disodium patient discontinued the trial due to a symptomatic hypocalcemia. Another pamidronate disodium patient discontinued therapy due to severe bone pain after each infusion, which the investigator felt was trial-drug-related. Renal Toxicity In a study of the safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium 90 mg (2-hour infusion) vs Zometa 4 mg (15-minute infusion) in bone metastases patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer, renal deterioration was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (<1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (≥1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients in this trial. See table below. Incidence of Renal Function Deterioration in Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Patients with Normal and Abnormal Serum Creatinine at BaselinePatients were randomized following the 15 minute infusion amendment for the Zometa arm. Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine Pamidronate Disodium 90 mg/2 hours Zometa 4 mg/15 minutes n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 20/246 (8.1%) 23/246 (9.3%) Abnormal 2/22 (9.1%) 1/26 (3.8%) Total 22/268 (8.2%) 24/272 (8.8%) Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of pamidronate disodium. Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing use: General: reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster, influenza-like symptoms; CNS: confusion and visual hallucinations, sometimes in the presence of electrolyte imbalance; Skin: rash, pruritus; Special senses: conjunctivitis, orbital inflammation; Renal and urinary disorders: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis including the collapsing variant, nephrotic syndrome, renal tubular disorders (RTD), tubulointerstitial nephritis and glomerulonephropathies; Laboratory abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hematuria. Rare instances of allergic manifestations have been reported, including hypotension, dyspnea, or angioedema, and, very rarely, anaphylactic shock. Pamidronate disodium for Injection USP is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to pamidronate disodium or other bisphosphonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), interstitial lung disease (ILD). Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain. Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including pamidronate disodium. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Data suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged. (See PRECAUTIONS.) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including pamidronate disodium. (See PRECAUTIONS.)"

Zometa ® is a registered trade of Novartis. n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 20/246 (8.1%) 23/246 (9.3%) Abnormal 2/22 (9.1%) 1/26 (3.8%) Total 22/268 (8.2%) 24/272 (8.8%) Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing use: General : reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster, influenza-like symptoms; CNS : confusion and visual hallucinations, sometimes in the presence of electrolyte imbalance; Skin : rash, pruritus; Special senses : conjunctivitis; Renal : focal segmental glomerulosclerosis including the collapsing variant, nephrotic syndrome; Laboratory abnormalities : hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hematuria. Rare instances of allergic manifestations have been reported, including hypotension, dyspnea, or angioedema, and very rarely, anaphylactic shock. Pamidronate disodium is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to pamidronate disodium or other bisphosphonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including pamidronate disodium. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Data suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procrdures as recovery may be prolonged. (See PRECAUTIONS )"

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Studies Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Transient mild elevation of temperature by at least 1°C was noted 24 to 48 hours after administration of pamidronate disodium in 34% of patients in clinical trials. In the saline trial, 18% of patients had a temperature elevation of at least 1°C 24 to 48 hours after treatment. Drug-related local soft-tissue symptoms (redness, swelling or induration and pain on palpation) at the site of catheter insertion were most common in patients treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium. Symptomatic treatment resulted in rapid resolution in all patients. Rare cases of uveitis, iritis, scleritis, and episcleritis have been reported, including one case of scleritis, and one case of uveitis upon separate rechallenges. Five of 231 patients (2%) who received pamidronate disodium during the four U.S. controlled hypercalcemia clinical studies were reported to have had seizures, 2 of whom had preexisting seizure disorders. None of the seizures were considered to be drug-related by the investigators. However, a possible relationship between the drug and the occurrence of seizures cannot be ruled out. It should be noted that in the saline arm 1 patient (4%) had a seizure. There are no controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 24 hours to 2 hours in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy. However, a comparison of data from separate clinical trials suggests that the overall safety profile in patients who received 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 24 hours is similar to those who received 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 2 hours. The only notable differences observed were an increase in the proportion of patients in the pamidronate disodium 24-hour group who experienced fluid overload and electrolyte/mineral abnormalities. At least 15% of patients treated with pamidronate disodium for hypercalcemia of malignancy also experienced the following adverse events during a clinical trial: General: Fluid overload, generalized pain Cardiovascular: Hypertension Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection Musculoskeletal: Bone pain Laboratory abnormality: Anemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia Many of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state. The following table lists the adverse experiences considered to be treatment-related during comparative, controlled U.S. trials.

Drug-related musculoskeletal pain and nervous system symptoms (dizziness, headache, paresthesia, increased sweating) were more common in patients with Paget’s disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium than in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy treated with the same dose. Adverse experiences considered to be related to trial drug, which occurred in at least 5% of patients with Paget’s disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium in two U.S. clinical trials, were fever, nausea, back pain, and bone pain. At least 10% of all pamidronate disodium-treated patients with Paget’s disease also experienced the following adverse experiences during clinical trials: Cardiovascular: Hypertension Musculoskeletal: Arthrosis, bone pain Nervous System: Headache Most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma The most commonly reported (> 15%) adverse experiences occurred with similar frequencies in the pamidronate disodium- and placebo-treatment groups, and most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state or cancer therapy.

In the breast cancer trials, mild elevations of serum creatinine occurred in 18.5% of pamidronate disodium patients and 12.3% of placebo patients. Mineral and electrolyte disturbances, including hypocalcemia, were reported rarely and in similar percentages of pamidronate disodium-treated patients compared with those in the placebo group. The reported frequencies of hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia for pamidronate disodium-treated patients were 3.3%, 10.5%, 1.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, and for placebo-treated patients were 1.2%, 12%, 1.7%, and 4.5%, respectively. In previous hypercalcemia of malignancy trials, patients treated with pamidronate disodium (60 to 90 mg over 24 hours) developed electrolyte abnormalities more frequently (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Hypercalcemia of Malignancy ). Arthralgias and myalgias were reported slightly more frequently in the pamidronate disodium group than in the placebo group (13.6% and 26% vs 10.8% and 20.1%, respectively). In multiple myeloma patients, there were five pamidronate disodium-related serious and unexpected adverse experiences. Four of these were reported during the 12-month extension of the multiple myeloma trial. Three of the reports were of worsening renal function developing in patients with progressive multiple myeloma or multiple myeloma-associated amyloidosis. The fourth report was the adult respiratory distress syndrome developing in a patient recovering from pneumonia and acute gangrenous cholecystitis. One pamidronate disodium-treated patient experienced an allergic reaction characterized by swollen and itchy eyes, runny nose, and scratchy throat within 24 hours after the sixth infusion. In the breast cancer trials, there were four pamidronate disodium-related adverse experiences, all moderate in severity, that caused a patient to discontinue participation in the trial. One was due to interstitial pneumonitis, another to malaise and dyspnea. One pamidronate disodium patient discontinued the trial due to a symptomatic hypocalcemia. Another pamidronate disodium patient discontinued therapy due to severe bone pain after each infusion, which the investigator felt was trial-drug-related. Renal Toxicity In a study of the safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium 90 mg (2 hour infusion) vs Zometa® 4 mg (15 minute infusion) in bone metastases patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer, renal deterioration was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (≥ 1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients in this trial. See Table below. Incidence of Renal Function Deterioration in Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Patients with Normal and Abnormal Serum Creatinine at Baseline* Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine PD 90 mg/2 hours Zometa® 4 mg/15 minutes n/N (%) n/N (%) *Patients were randomized following the 15-minute infusion amendment for the Zometa® arm.

Because these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing use: General : reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster, influenza-like symptoms; CNS : confusion and visual hallucinations, sometimes in the presence of electrolyte imbalance; Skin: rash, pruritus; Special senses : conjunctivitis, orbital inflammation; Renal and urinary disorders : focal segmental glomerulosclerosis including the collapsing variant, nephrotic syndrome,renal tubular disorders (RTD), tubulointerstitial nephritis, and glomerulonephropathies; Laboratory abnormalities : hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hematuria. Rare instances of allergic manifestations have been reported, including hypotension, dyspnea, or angioedema, and, very rarely, anaphylactic shock. Pamidronate disodium is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to pamidronate disodium or other bisphosphonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), interstitial lung disease (ILD); Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain. Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including pamidronate disodium. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Data suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate therapy, including pamidronate disodium. (See PRECAUTION S.)"

Incidence of Renal Function Deterioration in Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Patients with Normal and Abnormal Serum Creatinine at Baseline* Patient Population/ Baseline Creatinine Pamidronate Disodium 90 mg/2 hours Zometa® 4 mg/15 minutes n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 20/246 (8.1%) 23/246 (9.3%) Abnormal 2/22 (9.1%) 1/26 (3.8%) Total 22/268 (8.2%) 24/272 (8.8%) * Patients were randomized following the 15-minute infusion amendment for the Zometa® arm. Zometa® is a registered trademark of Novartis. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing use: General: reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster, influenza-like symptoms; CNS: confusion and visual hallucinations, sometimes in the presence of electrolyte imbalance; Skin: rash, pruritus; Special senses: conjunctivitis, orbital inflammation; Renal: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis including the collapsing variant, nephrotic syndrome; Laboratory abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hematuria. Rare instances of allergic manifestations have been reported, including hypotension, dyspnea, or angioedema, and, very rarely, anaphylactic shock. Pamidronate disodium is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to pamidronate disodium or other bisphosphonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS. ) Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including pamidronate disodium. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Data suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged. (See PRECAUTIONS .)"

        "Drug Interactions Concomitant administration of a loop diuretic had no effect on the calcium-lowering action of pamidronate disodium. Caution is indicated when pamidronate disodium is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when pamidronate disodium is used in combination with thalidomide."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Studies Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Transient mild elevation of temperature by at least 1°C was noted 24 to 48 hours after administration of pamidronate disodium in 34% of patients in clinical trials. In the saline trial, 18% of patients had a temperature elevation of at least 1°C 24 to 48 hours after treatment. Drug-related local soft-tissue symptoms (redness, swelling or induration and pain on palpation) at the site of catheter insertion were most common in patients treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium. Symptomatic treatment resulted in rapid resolution in all patients. Rare cases of uveitis, iritis, scleritis, and episcleritis have been reported, including one case of scleritis, and one case of uveitis upon separate rechallenges. Five of 231 patients (2%) who received pamidronate disodium during the four U.S. controlled hypercalcemia clinical studies were reported to have had seizures, 2 of whom had preexisting seizure disorders. None of the seizures were considered to be drug-related by the investigators. However, a possible relationship between the drug and the occurrence of seizures cannot be ruled out. It should be noted that in the saline arm 1 patient (4%) had a seizure. There are no controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 24 hours to 2 hours in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy. However, a comparison of data from separate clinical trials suggests that the overall safety profile in patients who received 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 24 hours is similar to those who received 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 2 hours. The only notable differences observed were an increase in the proportion of patients in the pamidronate 24 hour group who experienced fluid overload and electrolyte/mineral abnormalities. At least 15% of patients treated with pamidronate disodium for hypercalcemia of malignancy also experienced the following adverse events during a clinical trial: General: Fluid overload, generalized pain Cardiovascular: Hypertension Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection Musculoskeletal: Bone pain Laboratory abnormality : Anemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia Many of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state.

Drug-related musculoskeletal pain and nervous system symptoms (dizziness, headache, paresthesia, increased sweating) were more common in patients with Paget's disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium than in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy treated with the same dose. Adverse experiences considered to be related to trial drug, which occurred in at least 5% of patients with Paget's disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium in two U.S. clinical trials, were fever, nausea, back pain, and bone pain. At least 10% of all pamidronate disodium-treated patients with Paget's disease also experienced the following adverse experiences during clinical trials: Cardiovascular: Hypertension Musculoskeletal: Arthrosis, bone pain Nervous system: Headache Most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma The most commonly reported (>15%) adverse experiences occurred with similar frequencies in the pamidronate disodium and placebo treatment groups, and most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state or cancer therapy.

In the breast cancer trials, mild elevations of serum creatinine occurred in 18.5% of pamidronate disodium patients and 12.3% of placebo patients. Mineral and electrolyte disturbances, including hypocalcemia, were reported rarely and in similar percentages of pamidronate disodium-treated patients compared with those in the placebo group. The reported frequencies of hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophophatemia, and hypomagnesemia for pamidronate disodium-treated patients were 3.3%, 10.5%, 1.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, and for placebo-treated patients were 1.2%, 12%, 1.7%, and 4.5%, respectively. In previous hypercalcemia of malignancy trials, patients treated with pamidronate disodium (60 or 90 mg over 24 hours) developed electrolyte abnormalities more frequently (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Hypercalcemia of Malignancy ). Arthralgias and myalgias were reported slightly more frequently in the pamidronate disodium group than in the placebo group (13.6% and 26% vs 10.8% and 20.1%, respectively). In multiple myeloma patients, there were five pamidronate disodium-related serious and unexpected adverse experiences. Four of these were reported during the 12 month extension of the multiple myeloma trial. Three of the reports were of worsening renal function developing in patients with progressive multiple myeloma or multiple myeloma-associated amyloidosis. The fourth report was the adult respiratory distress syndrome developing in a patient recovering from pneumonia and acute gangrenous cholecystitis. One pamidronate disodium-treated patient experienced an allergic reaction characterized by swollen and itchy eyes, runny nose, and scratchy throat within 24 hours after the sixth infusion. In the breast cancer trials, there were four pamidronate disodium-related adverse experiences, all moderate in severity, that caused a patient to discontinue participation in the trial. One was due to interstitial pneumonitis, another to malaise and dyspnea. One pamidronate disodium patient discontinued the trial due to a symptomatic hypocalcemia. Another pamidronate disodium patient discontinued therapy due to severe bone pain after each infusion, which the investigator felt was trial-drug-related. Renal Toxicity In a study of the safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium 90 mg (2 hour infusion) versus Zometa ® 4 mg (15 minute infusion) in bone metastases patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer, renal deterioration was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (<1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (≥1.4 mg/dL).

Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing use: General : reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster, influenza-like symptoms; CNS : confusion and visual hallucinations, sometimes in the presence of electrolyte imbalance; Skin : rash, pruritus; Special senses : conjunctivitis, orbital inflammation; Renal : focal segmental glomerulosclerosis including the collapsing variant, nephrotic syndrome; Laboratory abnormalities : hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hematuria. Rare instances of allergic manifestations have been reported, including hypotension, dyspnea, or angioedema, and, very rarely, anaphylactic shock. Pamidronate disodium is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to pamidronate disodium or other bisphosphonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including pamidronate disodium. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Data suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged (see PRECAUTIONS ).",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Studies Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Transient mild elevation of temperature by at least 1°C was noted 24 to 48 hours after administration of pamidronate disodium in 34% of patients in clinical trials. In the saline trial, 18% of patients had a temperature elevation of at least 1°C 24 to 48 hours after treatment. Drug-related local soft-tissue symptoms (redness, swelling or induration and pain on palpation) at the site of catheter insertion were most common in patients treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium. Symptomatic treatment resulted in rapid resolution in all patients. Rare cases of uveitis, iritis, scleritis, and episcleritis have been reported, including one case of scleritis, and one case of uveitis upon separate rechallenges. Five of 231 patients (2%) who received pamidronate disodium during the four U.S. controlled hypercalcemia clinical studies were reported to have had seizures, 2 of whom had preexisting seizure disorders. None of the seizures were considered to be drug-related by the investigators. However, a possible relationship between the drug and the occurrence of seizures cannot be ruled out. It should be noted that in the saline arm 1 patient (4%) had a seizure. There are no controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 24 hours to 2 hours in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy. However, a comparison of data from separate clinical trials suggests that the overall safety profile in patients who received 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 24 hours is similar to those who received 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 2 hours. The only notable differences observed were an increase in the proportion of patients in the pamidronate 24 hour group who experienced fluid overload and electrolyte/mineral abnormalities. At least 15% of patients treated with pamidronate disodium for hypercalcemia of malignancy also experienced the following adverse events during a clinical trial: General : Fluid overload, generalized pain Cardiovascular : Hypertension Gastrointestinal : Abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting Genitourinary : Urinary tract infection Musculoskeletal : Bone pain Laboratory abnormality : Anemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia Many of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state.

Drug-related musculoskeletal pain and nervous system symptoms (dizziness, headache, paresthesia, increased sweating) were more common in patients with Paget’s disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium than in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy treated with the same dose. Adverse experiences considered to be related to trial drug, which occurred in at least 5% of patients with Paget’s disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium in two U.S. clinical trials, were fever, nausea, back pain, and bone pain. At least 10% of all pamidronate disodium-treated patients with Paget’s disease also experienced the following adverse experiences during clinical trials: Cardiovascular : Hypertension Musculoskeletal : Arthrosis, bone pain Nervous system : Headache Most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breaset Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma The most commonly reported (>15%) adverse experiences occurred with similar frequencies in the pamidronate disodium and placebo treatment groups, and most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state or cancer therapy.

In the breast cancer trials, mild elevations of serum creatinine occurred in 18.5% of pamidronate disodium patients and 12.3% of placebo patients. Mineral and electrolyte disturbances, including hypocalcemia, were reported rarely and in similar percentages of pamidronate disodium-treated patients compared with those in the placebo group. The reported frequencies of hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophophatemia, and hypomagnesemia for pamidronate disodium-treated patients were 3.3%, 10.5%, 1.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, and for placebo-treated patients were 1.2%, 12%, 1.7%, and 4.5%, respectively. In previous hypercalcemia of malignancy trials, patients treated with pamidronate disodium (60 or 90 mg over 24 hours) developed electrolyte abnormalities more frequently (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Hypercalcemia of Malignancy ). Arthralgias and myalgias were reported slightly more frequently in the pamidronate disodium group than in the placebo group (13.6% and 26% vs 10.8% and 20.1%, respectively). In multiple myeloma patients, there were five pamidronate disodium-related serious and unexpected adverse experiences. Four of these were reported during the 12 month extension of the multiple myeloma trial. Three of the reports were of worsening renal function developing in patients with progressive multiple myeloma or multiple myeloma-associated amyloidosis. The fourth report was the adult respiratory distress syndrome developing in a patient recovering from pneumonia and acute gangrenous cholecystitis. One pamidronate disodium-treated patient experienced an allergic reaction characterized by swollen and itchy eyes, runny nose, and scratchy throat within 24 hours after the sixth infusion. In the breast cancer trials, there were four pamidronate disodium-related adverse experiences, all moderate in severity, that caused a patient to discontinue participation in the trial. One was due to interstitial pneumonitis, another to malaise and dyspnea. One pamidronate disodium patient discontinued the trial due to a symptomatic hypocalcemia. Another pamidronate disodium patient discontinued therapy due to severe bone pain after each infusion, which the investigator felt was trial-drug-related. Renal Toxicity In a study of the safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium 90 mg (2 hour infusion) versus Zometa ® 4 mg (15 minute infusion) in bone metastases patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer, renal deterioration was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (<1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (≥1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients in this trial. See table below. Incidence of Renal Function Deterioration in Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Patients with Normal and Abnormal Serum Creatinine at Baseline* Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine PD 90 mg/2 hours Zometa ® 4 mg/15 minutes * Patients were randomized following the 15 minute infusion amendment for the Zometa ® arm.

Pamidronate disodium is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to pamidronate disodium or other bisphosphonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including pamidronate disodium. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Data suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged. (See PRECAUTIONS.)"

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General: reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster, influenza-like symptoms CNS: confusion and visual hallucinations, sometimes in the presence of electrolyte imbalance; Skin: rash, pruritus Special senses: conjunctivitis, orbital inflammation; Renal and urinary disorders: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis including the collapsing variant, nephrotic syndrome; renal tubular disorders (RTD); tubulointerstitial nephritis, and glomerulonephropathies. Laboratory abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hematuria. Rare instances of allergic manifestations have been reported, including hypotension, dyspnea, or angioedema, and, very rarely, anaphylactic shock. Pamidronate disodium is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to pamidronate disodium or other bisphosphonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), interstitial lung disease (ILD). Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: severe, occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Renal failure: Do not exceed single doses of 90 mg pamidronate disodium. Assess renal function before each treatment. In patients with bone metastases with severe renal impairment, use of pamidronate disodium is not recommended. (5.1) •Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: May cause fetal harm. Advise females of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. (5.2) •Electrolyte disorders (e.g., hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia): Monitor phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium and vitamin D and adequately supplement as appropriate. (5.3) •Osteonecrosis of the jaw: Perform preventive dental procedures prior to initiating pamidronate disodium. Avoid invasive procedures if possible in patients receiving pamidronate disodium. (5.4) •Atypical fractures of the femur can occur after minimal or no trauma. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain for possible fracture. (5.5) 5.1 Deterioration in Renal Function, Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate disodium, have been associated with renal toxicity, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This toxicity has been manifested as nephritic syndrome, deterioration of renal function, and renal failure. Renal failure has been reported in patients after a single dose of pamidronate disodium. Some patients had gradual improvement in renal status after pamidronate disodium was discontinued. Do not administer single doses of pamidronate disodium in excess of 90 mg due to the risk of clinically significant deterioration in renal function, [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Assess serum creatinine prior to each treatment. Withhold treatment until renal function returns to baseline in patients who show evidence of deterioration in renal function. Do not administer pamidronate in patients with severe renal impairment for the treatment of bone metastases [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)]. 5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate disodium, are incorporated into the bone matrix, and gradually released over periods of weeks to years. Pamidronate disodium may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In reproductive studies in rats and rabbits, pamidronate doses equivalent to 0.6 to 8.3 times the highest human recommended dose resulted in maternal toxicity and embryo/fetal effects. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of pamidronate disodium in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.3 Electrolyte Disorders Cases of asymptomatic hypophosphatemia (12%), hypokalemia (7%), hypomagnesemia (11%), and hypocalcemia (5% to 17%), were reported in pamidronate disodium-treated patients. Rare cases of symptomatic hypocalcemia (including tetany) have been reported in association with pamidronate disodium therapy. Monitor serum levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and potassium, following initiation of therapy with pamidronate disodium. If hypocalcemia occurs, short-term calcium therapy may be necessary. In the absence of hypercalcemia, supplement with oral calcium and vitamin D in order to minimize the risk of hypocalcemia. 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including pamidronate disodium. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids, which may be risk factors for ONJ. Postmarketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of ONJ with certain tumor type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma), and dental status (dental extraction, periodontal disease, local trauma including poorly fitting dentures). Local infection including osteomyelitis has been reported with ONJ. Patients receiving pamidronate should maintain good oral hygiene and have a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to initiation of treatment. While on treatment, avoid invasive dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.5 Atypical Fractures of the Femur Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, including pamidronate disodium. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to just above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. These fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients may experience thigh or groin pain weeks to months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore, the contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures also has been reported. A number of case reports noted that patients were receiving treatment also with glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone) at the time of fracture. Causality with bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain in the absence of trauma should be evaluated for an atypical fracture. Consider discontinuation of pamidronate disodium therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. It is unknown whether the risk of atypical femur fracture continues after stopping therapy."

        "Drug Interactions Concomitant administration of a loop diuretic had no effect on the calcium-lowering action of pamidronate disodium. Caution is indicated when pamidronate disodium is used with other potentially nephrotoxic drugs. In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when pamidronate disodium is used in combination with thalidomide."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Studies Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Transient mild elevation of temperature by at least 1°C was noted 24 to 48 hours after administration of pamidronate disodium in 34% of patients in clinical trials. In the saline trial, 18% of patients had a temperature elevation of at least 1°C 24 to 48 hours after treatment. Drug-related local soft-tissue symptoms (redness, swelling or induration and pain on palpation) at the site of catheter insertion were most common in patients treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium. Symptomatic treatment resulted in rapid resolution in all patients. Rare cases of uveitis, iritis, scleritis, and episcleritis have been reported, including one case of scleritis, and one case of uveitis upon separate rechallenges. Five of 231 patients (2%) who received pamidronate disodium during the four U.S. controlled hypercalcemia clinical studies were reported to have had seizures, 2 of whom had preexisting seizure disorders. None of the seizures were considered to be drug-related by the investigators. However, a possible relationship between the drug and the occurrence of seizures cannot be ruled out. It should be noted that in the saline arm 1 patient (4%) had a seizure. There are no controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 24 hours to 2 hours in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy. However, a comparison of data from separate clinical trials suggests that the overall safety profile in patients who received 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 24 hours is similar to those who received 90 mg pamidronate disodium over 2 hours. The only notable differences observed were an increase in the proportion of patients in the pamidronate 24 hour group who experienced fluid overload and electrolyte/mineral abnormalities. At least 15% of patients treated with pamidronate disodium for hypercalcemia of malignancy also experienced the following adverse events during a clinical trial: General: Fluid overload, generalized pain Cardiovascular: Hypertension Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, nausea, vomiting Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection Musculoskeletal: Bone pain Laboratory abnormality : Anemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia Many of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state. The following table lists the adverse experiences considered to be treatment-related during comparative, controlled U.S. trials.

Drug-related musculoskeletal pain and nervous system symptoms (dizziness, headache, paresthesia, increased sweating) were more common in patients with Paget's disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium than in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy treated with the same dose. Adverse experiences considered to be related to trial drug, which occurred in at least 5% of patients with Paget's disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium in two U.S. clinical trials, were fever, nausea, back pain, and bone pain. At least 10% of all pamidronate disodium-treated patients with Paget's disease also experienced the following adverse experiences during clinical trials: Cardiovascular: Hypertension Musculoskeletal: Arthrosis, bone pain Nervous system: Headache Most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma The most commonly reported (>15%) adverse experiences occurred with similar frequencies in the pamidronate disodium and placebo treatment groups, and most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state or cancer therapy.

In the breast cancer trials, mild elevations of serum creatinine occurred in 18.5% of pamidronate disodium patients and 12.3% of placebo patients. Mineral and electrolyte disturbances, including hypocalcemia, were reported rarely and in similar percentages of pamidronate disodium-treated patients compared with those in the placebo group. The reported frequencies of hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophophatemia, and hypomagnesemia for pamidronate disodium-treated patients were 3.3%, 10.5%, 1.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, and for placebo-treated patients were 1.2%, 12%, 1.7%, and 4.5%, respectively. In previous hypercalcemia of malignancy trials, patients treated with pamidronate disodium (60 or 90 mg over 24 hours) developed electrolyte abnormalities more frequently (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Hypercalcemia of Malignancy ). Arthralgias and myalgias were reported slightly more frequently in the pamidronate disodium group than in the placebo group (13.6% and 26% vs 10.8% and 20.1%, respectively). In multiple myeloma patients, there were five pamidronate disodium-related serious and unexpected adverse experiences. Four of these were reported during the 12 month extension of the multiple myeloma trial. Three of the reports were of worsening renal function developing in patients with progressive multiple myeloma or multiple myeloma-associated amyloidosis. The fourth report was the adult respiratory distress syndrome developing in a patient recovering from pneumonia and acute gangrenous cholecystitis. One pamidronate disodium-treated patient experienced an allergic reaction characterized by swollen and itchy eyes, runny nose, and scratchy throat within 24 hours after the sixth infusion. In the breast cancer trials, there were four pamidronate disodium-related adverse experiences, all moderate in severity, that caused a patient to discontinue participation in the trial. One was due to interstitial pneumonitis, another to malaise and dyspnea. One pamidronate disodium patient discontinued the trial due to a symptomatic hypocalcemia. Another pamidronate disodium patient discontinued therapy due to severe bone pain after each infusion, which the investigator felt was trial-drug-related. Renal Toxicity In a study of the safety and efficacy of pamidronate disodium 90 mg (2 hour infusion) versus Zometa® 4 mg (15 minute infusion) in bone metastases patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer, renal deterioration was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL for patients with normal baseline creatinine (<1.4 mg/dL) or an increase of 1.0 mg/dL for patients with an abnormal baseline creatinine (≥1.4 mg/dL). The following are data on the incidence of renal deterioration in patients in this trial. See table below. Incidence of Renal Function Deterioration in Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Patients with Normal and Abnormal Serum Creatinine at BaselinePatients were randomized following the 15 minute infusion amendment for the Zometa ® arm. Zometa ® is a registered trade of Novartis. Patient Population/Baseline Creatinine PD 90 mg/2 hours Zometa® 4 mg/15 minutes n/N (%) n/N (%) Normal 20/246 (8.1%) 23/246 (9.3%) Abnormal 2/22 (9.1%) 1/26 (3.8%) Total 22/268 (8.2%) 24/272 (8.8%) Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing use: General: reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster, influenza-like symptoms; CNS: confusion and visual hallucinations, sometimes in the presence of electrolyte imbalance; Skin: rash, pruritus; Special senses: conjunctivitis; Renal: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis including the collapsing variant, nephrotic syndrome; Laboratory abnormalities: hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hematuria. Rare instances of allergic manifestations have been reported, including hypotension, dyspnea, or angioedema, and very rarely, anaphylactic shock. Pamidronate disodium is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant hypersensitivity to pamidronate disodium or other bisphosphonates (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily involving the jaw) have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates, including pamidronate disodium. Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be risk factors for ONJ. Data suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ in certain cancers, such as advanced breast cancer and multiple myeloma. The majority of the reported cases are in cancer patients following invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extraction. It is therefore prudent to avoid invasive dental procedures as recovery may be prolonged. (See PRECAUTIONS.)"
