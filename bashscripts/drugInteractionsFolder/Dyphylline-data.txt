        "Drug interactions: Synergism between xanthine bronchodilators (e.g., theophylline), ephedrine, and other sympathomimetic bronchodilators has been reported. This should be considered whenever these agents are prescribed concomitantly. Concurrent administration of dyphylline and probenecid, which competes for tubular secretion, has been shown to increase the plasma half-life of dyphylline (see Clinical Pharmacology)."

        "Adverse Reactions To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-526-3840 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Adverse reactions with the use of LUFYLLIN have been infrequent, relatively mild, and rarely required reduction in dosage or withdrawal of therapy. The following adverse reactions which have been reported with other xanthine bronchodilators, and which have most often been related to excessive drug plasma levels, should be considered as potential adverse effects when dyphylline is administered: Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, hematemesis, diarrhea. Central nervous system: headache, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, hyperexcitability, agitation, muscle twitching, generalized clonic and tonic convulsions. Cardiovascular: palpitation, tachycardia, extrasystoles, flushing, hypotension, circulatory failure, ventricular arrhythmias. Respiratory: tachypnea. Renal: albuminuria, gross and microscopic hematuria, diuresis. Other: hyperglycemia, inappropriate ADH syndrome."

      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS This formulation may cause nausea, headache, cardiac palpitation and CNS stimulation. Postprandial administration may help avoid gastric discomfort. The following adverse reactions which have been reported with other xanthine bronchodilators, and which have most often been related to excessive drug plasma levels, should be considered as potential adverse effects when dyphylline is administered. Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, hematemesis, diarrhea.

Cardiovascular: palpitation, tachycardia, extrasystoles, flushing, hypotension, circulatory failure, ventricular arrhythmias. Respiratory: tachypnea. Renal: albuminuria, gross and microscopic hematuria, diuresis. Other: hyperglycemia, inappropriate ADH syndrome. Large doses of Guaifenesin may produce emesis, but gastrointestinal upset at ordinary dosage levels is rare."
