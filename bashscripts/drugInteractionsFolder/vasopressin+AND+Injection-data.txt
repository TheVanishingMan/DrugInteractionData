Ganglionic blocking agents may produce a marked increase in sensitivity to the pressor effects of vasopressin. Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with vasopressin. It is also not known whether vasopressin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Vasopressin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Doses of vasopressin sufficient for an antidiuretic effect are not likely to produce tonic uterine contractions that could be deleterious to the fetus or threaten the continuation of the pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when vasopressin is administered to a nursing woman."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Pressor effects of catecholamines and Vasostrict(R) are expected to be additive. (7.1) Indomethacin may prolong effects of Vasostrict(R). (7.2) Co-administration of ganglionic blockers or drugs causing SIADH may increase the pressor response. (7.3, 7.5) Co-administration of drugs causing diabetes insipidus may decrease the pressor response. (7.6) 7.1 Catecholamines Use with catecholamines is expected to result in an additive effect on mean arterial blood pressure and other hemodynamic parameters. 7.2 Indomethacin Use with indomethacin may prolong the effect of Vasostrict(R) on cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Ganglionic Blocking Agents Use with ganglionic blocking agents may increase the effect of Vasostrict(R) on mean arterial blood pressure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Furosemide Use with furosemide increases the effect of Vasostrict(R) on osmolar clearance and urine flow [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Drugs Suspected of Causing SIADH Use with drugs suspected of causing SIADH (e.g., SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, haloperidol, chlorpropamide, enalapril, methyldopa, pentamidine, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, felbamate) may increase the pressor effect in addition to the antidiuretic effect of Vasostrict(R). 7.6 Drugs Suspected of Causing Diabetes Insipidus Use with drugs suspected of causing diabetes insipidus (e.g., demeclocycline, lithium, foscarnet, clozapine) may decrease the pressor effect in addition to the antidiuretic effect of Vasostrict(R)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of vasopressin were identified in the literature. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Bleeding/lymphatic system disorders: Hemorrhagic shock, decreased platelets, intractable bleeding Cardiac disorders: Right heart failure, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, myocardial ischemia Gastrointestinal disorders: Mesenteric ischemia Hepatobiliary: Increased bilirubin levels Renal/urinary disorders: Acute renal insufficiency Vascular disorders: Distal limb ischemia Metabolic: Hyponatremia Skin: Ischemic lesions The most common adverse reactions include decreased cardiac output, bradycardia, tachyarrhythmias, hyponatremia and ischemia (coronary, mesenteric, skin, digital).
