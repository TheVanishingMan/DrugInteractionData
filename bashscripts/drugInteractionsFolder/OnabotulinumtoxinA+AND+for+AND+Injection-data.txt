        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Patients receiving concomitant treatment of BOTOX and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like agents), or muscle relaxants, should be observed closely because the effect of BOTOX may be potentiated (7) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Other Agents Interfering with Neuromuscular Transmission Co-administration of BOTOX and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Use of anticholinergic drugs after administration of BOTOX may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effects. 7.3 Other Botulinum Neurotoxin Products The effect of administering different botulinum neurotoxin products at the same time or within several months of each other is unknown. Excessive neuromuscular weakness may be exacerbated by administration of another botulinum toxin prior to the resolution of the effects of a previously administered botulinum toxin. 7.4 Muscle Relaxants Excessive weakness may also be exaggerated by administration of a muscle relaxant before or after administration of BOTOX."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions to BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Spread of Toxin Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Bronchitis and Upper Respiratory Tract Infections in Patients Treated for Spasticity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Urinary Retention in Patients Treated for Bladder Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and >placebo) are (6.1): OAB: urinary tract infection, dysuria, urinary retention Detrusor Overactivity associated with a neurologic condition: urinary tract infection, urinary retention Chronic Migraine: neck pain, headache Spasticity: pain in extremity Cervical Dystonia: dysphagia, upper respiratory infection, neck pain, headache, increased cough, flu syndrome, back pain, rhinitis Axillary Hyperhidrosis: injection site pain and hemorrhage, non-axillary sweating, pharyngitis, flu syndrome To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Allergan at 1-800-433-8871 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic contain the same active ingredient in the same formulation, but with different labeled Indications and Usage. Therefore, adverse reactions observed with the use of BOTOX Cosmetic also have the potential to be observed with the use of BOTOX. In general, adverse reactions occur within the first week following injection of BOTOX and while generally transient, may have a duration of several months or longer. Localized pain, infection, inflammation, tenderness, swelling, erythema, and/or bleeding/bruising may be associated with the injection. Needle-related pain and/or anxiety may result in vasovagal responses (including e.g., syncope, hypotension), which may require appropriate medical therapy. Local weakness of the injected muscle(s) represents the expected pharmacological action of botulinum toxin. However, weakness of nearby muscles may also occur due to spread of toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Overactive Bladder Table 10 presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials for overactive bladder occurring within 12 weeks of the first BOTOX treatment. Table 10: Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of BOTOX treated Patients and More Often than in Placebo-treated Patients Within the First 12 Weeks after Intradetrusor Injection, in Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Clinical Trials in Patients with OAB *Elevated PVR not requiring catheterization. Catheterization was required for PVR ≥350 mL regardless of symptoms, and for PVR ≥200 mL to <350 mL with symptoms (e.g., voiding difficulty). Adverse Reactions BOTOX 100 Units (N=552) Placebo (N=542) Urinary tract infection Dysuria Urinary retention Bacteriuria Residual urine volume* 99 (18%) 50 (9%) 31 (6%) 24 (4%) 17 (3%) 30 (6%) 36 (7%) 2 (0%) 11 (2%) 1 (0%) A higher incidence of urinary tract infection was observed in patients with diabetes mellitus treated with BOTOX 100 Units and placebo than in patients without diabetes, as shown in Table 11. Table 11: Proportion of Patients Experiencing Urinary Tract Infection following an Injection in Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Clinical Trials in OAB according to history of Diabetes Mellitus Patients with Diabetes Patients without Diabetes BOTOX 100 Units (N=81) Placebo (N=69) BOTOX 100 Units (N=526) Placebo (N=516) Urinary tract infection (UTI) 25 (31%) 8 (12%) 135 (26%) 51 (10%) The incidence of UTI increased in patients who experienced a maximum post-void residual (PVR) urine volume ≥200 mL following BOTOX injection compared to those with a maximum PVR <200 mL following BOTOX injection, 44% versus 23%, respectively. No change was observed in the overall safety profile with repeat dosing during an open-label, uncontrolled extension trial. Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition Table 12 presents the most frequently reported adverse reactions in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies within 12 weeks of injection for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition. Table 12: Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of BOTOX treated Patients and More Frequent than in Placebo-treated Patients Within the First 12 Weeks after Intradetrusor Injection in Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions BOTOX 200 Units (N=262) Placebo (N=272) Urinary tract infection Urinary retention Hematuria 64 (24%) 45 (17%) 10 (4%) 47 (17%) 8 (3%) 8 (3%) The following adverse reactions with BOTOX 200 Units were reported at any time following initial injection and prior to re-injection or study exit (median duration of 44 weeks of exposure): urinary tract infections (49%), urinary retention (17%), constipation (4%), muscular weakness (4%), dysuria (4%), fall (3%), gait disturbance (3%), and muscle spasm (2%). In the MS patients enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, the MS exacerbation annualized rate (i.e., number of MS exacerbation events per patient-year) was 0.23 for BOTOX and 0.20 for placebo. No change was observed in the overall safety profile with repeat dosing. Chronic Migraine In double-blind, placebo-controlled chronic migraine efficacy trials (Study 1 and Study 2), the discontinuation rate was 12% in the BOTOX treated group and 10% in the placebo-treated group. Discontinuations due to an adverse event were 4% in the BOTOX group and 1% in the placebo group. The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation in the BOTOX group were neck pain, headache, worsening migraine, muscular weakness and eyelid ptosis. The most frequently reported adverse reactions following injection of BOTOX for chronic migraine appear in Table 13. Table 13: Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of BOTOX treated Patients and More Frequent than in Placebo-treated Patients in Two Chronic Migraine Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions by System Organ Class BOTOX 155 Units-195 Units (N=687) Placebo (N=692) Nervous system disorders Headache Migraine Facial paresis 32 (5%) 26 (4%) 15 (2%) 22 (3%) 18 (3%) 0 (0%) Eye disorders Eyelid ptosis 25 (4%) 2 (<1%) Infections and Infestations Bronchitis 17 (3%) 11 (2%) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Neck pain 60 (9%) 19 (3%) Musculoskeletal stiffness 25 (4%) 6 (1%) Muscular weakness 24 (4%) 2 (<1%) Myalgia 21 (3%) 6 (1%) Musculoskeletal pain 18 (3%) 10 (1%) Muscle spasms 13 (2%) 6 (1%) General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site pain 23 (3%) 14 (2%) Vascular Disorders Hypertension 11 (2%) 7 (1%) Other adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in the BOTOX group compared to the placebo group at a frequency less than 1% and potentially BOTOX related include: vertigo, dry eye, eyelid edema, dysphagia, eye infection, and jaw pain. Severe worsening of migraine requiring hospitalization occurred in approximately 1% of BOTOX treated patients in Study 1 and Study 2, usually within the first week after treatment, compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Upper Limb Spasticity The most frequently reported adverse reactions following injection of BOTOX for adult spasticity appear in Table 14. Table 14: Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of BOTOX treated Patients and More Frequent than in Placebo-treated Patients in Adult Spasticity Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions by System Organ Class BOTOX 251 Units- 360 Units (N=115) BOTOX 150 Units- 250 Units (N=188) BOTOX <150 Units (N=54) Placebo (N=182) Gastrointestinal disorder Nausea 3 (3%) 3 (2%) 1 (2%) 1 (1%) General disorders and administration site conditions Fatigue 4 (3%) 4 (2%) 1 (2%) 0 Infections and infestations Bronchitis 4 (3%) 4 (2%) 0 2 (1%) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Pain in extremity 7 (6%) 10 (5%) 5 (9%) 8 (4%) Muscular weakness 0 7 (4%) 1 (2%) 2 (1%) Twenty two adult patients, enrolled in double-blind placebo controlled studies, received 400 Units or higher of BOTOX for treatment of upper limb spasticity. In addition, 44 adults received 400 Units of BOTOX or higher for four consecutive treatments over approximately one year for treatment of upper limb spasticity. The type and frequency of adverse reactions observed in patients treated with 400 Units of BOTOX were similar to those reported in patients treated for upper limb spasticity with 360 Units of BOTOX. Cervical Dystonia In cervical dystonia patients evaluated for safety in double-blind and open-label studies following injection of BOTOX, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were dysphagia (19%), upper respiratory infection (12%), neck pain (11%), and headache (11%). Other events reported in 2-10% of patients in any one study in decreasing order of incidence include: increased cough, flu syndrome, back pain, rhinitis, dizziness, hypertonia, soreness at injection site, asthenia, oral dryness, speech disorder, fever, nausea, and drowsiness. Stiffness, numbness, diplopia, ptosis, and dyspnea have been reported. Dysphagia and symptomatic general weakness may be attributable to an extension of the pharmacology of BOTOX resulting from the spread of the toxin outside the injected muscles [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)]. The most common severe adverse reaction associated with the use of BOTOX injection in patients with cervical dystonia is dysphagia with about 20% of these cases also reporting dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)]. Most dysphagia is reported as mild or moderate in severity. However, it may be associated with more severe signs and symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Additionally, reports in the literature include a case of a female patient who developed brachial plexopathy two days after injection of 120 Units of BOTOX for the treatment of cervical dystonia, and reports of dysphonia in patients who have been treated for cervical dystonia. Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis The most frequently reported adverse reactions (3-10% of adult patients) following injection of BOTOX in double-blind studies included injection site pain and hemorrhage, non-axillary sweating, infection, pharyngitis, flu syndrome, headache, fever, neck or back pain, pruritus, and anxiety. The data reflect 346 patients exposed to BOTOX 50 Units and 110 patients exposed to BOTOX 75 Units in each axilla. Blepharospasm In a study of blepharospasm patients who received an average dose per eye of 33 Units (injected at 3 to 5 sites) of the currently manufactured BOTOX, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were ptosis (21%), superficial punctate keratitis (6%), and eye dryness (6%). Other events reported in prior clinical studies in decreasing order of incidence include: irritation, tearing, lagophthalmos, photophobia, ectropion, keratitis, diplopia, entropion, diffuse skin rash, and local swelling of the eyelid skin lasting for several days following eyelid injection. In two cases of VII nerve disorder, reduced blinking from BOTOX injection of the orbicularis muscle led to serious corneal exposure, persistent epithelial defect, corneal ulceration and a case of corneal perforation. Focal facial paralysis, syncope, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis have also been reported after treatment of blepharospasm. Strabismus Extraocular muscles adjacent to the injection site can be affected, causing vertical deviation, especially with higher doses of BOTOX. The incidence rates of these adverse effects in 2058 adults who received a total of 3650 injections for horizontal strabismus was 17%. The incidence of ptosis has been reported to be dependent on the location of the injected muscles, 1% after inferior rectus injections, 16% after horizontal rectus injections and 38% after superior rectus injections. In a series of 5587 injections, retrobulbar hemorrhage occurred in 0.3% of cases. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Formation of neutralizing antibodies to botulinum toxin type A may reduce the effectiveness of BOTOX treatment by inactivating the biological activity of the toxin. In a long term, open-label study evaluating 326 cervical dystonia patients treated for an average of 9 treatment sessions with the current formulation of BOTOX, 4 (1.2%) patients had positive antibody tests. All 4 of these patients responded to BOTOX therapy at the time of the positive antibody test. However, 3 of these patients developed clinical resistance after subsequent treatment, while the fourth patient continued to respond to BOTOX therapy for the remainder of the study. One patient among the 445 hyperhidrosis patients (0.2%), two patients among the 380 adult upper limb spasticity patients (0.5%), no patients among 406 migraine patients, no patients among 615 overactive bladder patients, and no patients among 475 detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition patients with analyzed specimens developed the presence of neutralizing antibodies. The data reflect the patients whose test results were considered positive or negative for neutralizing activity to BOTOX in a mouse protection assay. The results of these tests are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of neutralizing activity to BOTOX with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. The critical factors for neutralizing antibody formation have not been well characterized. The results from some studies suggest that BOTOX injections at more frequent intervals or at higher doses may lead to greater incidence of antibody formation. The potential for antibody formation may be minimized by injecting with the lowest effective dose given at the longest feasible intervals between injections. 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of BOTOX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: abdominal pain; alopecia, including madarosis; anorexia; brachial plexopathy; denervation/muscle atrophy; diarrhea; hyperhidrosis; hypoacusis; hypoaesthesia; malaise; paresthesia; peripheral neuropathy; radiculopathy; erythema multiforme, dermatitis psoriasiform, and psoriasiform eruption; strabismus; tinnitus; and visual disturbances. There have been spontaneous reports of death, sometimes associated with dysphagia, pneumonia, and/or other significant debility or anaphylaxis, after treatment with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)]. There have also been reports of adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, some with fatal outcomes. Some of these patients had risk factors including cardiovascular disease. The exact relationship of these events to the botulinum toxin injection has not been established. New onset or recurrent seizures have also been reported, typically in patients who are predisposed to experiencing these events. The exact relationship of these events to the botulinum toxin injection has not been established."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potency Units of BOTOX are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products (5.1, 11) Spread of toxin effects; swallowing and breathing difficulties can lead to death. Seek immediate medical attention if respiratory, speech or swallowing difficulties occur (5.2, 5.6) Potential serious adverse reactions after BOTOX injections for unapproved uses (5.3) Concomitant neuromuscular disorder may exacerbate clinical effects of treatment (5.5) Use with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (5.6, 5.7, 5.10) Corneal exposure and ulceration due to reduced blinking may occur with BOTOX treatment of blepharospasm (5.8) Retrobulbar hemorrhages and compromised retinal circulation may occur with BOTOX treatment of strabismus (5.9) Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections in patients treated for upper limb spasticity (5.10) Urinary tract infections in patients treated for OAB (5.12) Urinary retention: Post-void residual urine volume should be monitored in patients treated for OAB or detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition who do not catheterize routinely, particularly patients with multiple sclerosis or diabetes mellitus. (5.13) 5.1 Lack of Interchangeability between Botulinum Toxin Products The potency Units of BOTOX are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Description (11)]. 5.2 Spread of Toxin Effect Postmarketing safety data from BOTOX and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children, and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders occur. No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with dermatologic use of BOTOX/BOTOX Cosmetic at the labeled dose of 20 Units (for glabellar lines) or 100 Units (for severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) have been reported. No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with BOTOX for blepharospasm at the recommended dose (30 Units and below), strabismus, or for chronic migraine at the labeled doses have been reported. 5.3 Serious Adverse Reactions with Unapproved Use Serious adverse reactions, including excessive weakness, dysphagia, and aspiration pneumonia, with some adverse reactions associated with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received BOTOX injections for unapproved uses. In these cases, the adverse reactions were not necessarily related to distant spread of toxin, but may have resulted from the administration of BOTOX to the site of injection and/or adjacent structures. In several of the cases, patients had pre-existing dysphagia or other significant disabilities. There is insufficient information to identify factors associated with an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with the unapproved uses of BOTOX. The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX for unapproved uses have not been established. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and/or immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, serum sickness, urticaria, soft tissue edema, and dyspnea. If such a reaction occurs, further injection of BOTOX should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted. One fatal case of anaphylaxis has been reported in which lidocaine was used as the diluent, and consequently the causal agent cannot be reliably determined. 5.5 Pre-Existing Neuromuscular Disorders Individuals with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) should be monitored when given botulinum toxin. Patients with neuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphonia, dysarthria, severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from therapeutic doses of BOTOX [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties Treatment with BOTOX and other botulinum toxin products can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. Patients with pre-existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or oropharyngeal muscles that control swallowing or breathing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin. Dysphagia may persist for several months, and require use of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised. Treatment with botulinum toxins may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation. This may result in a critical loss of breathing capacity in patients with respiratory disorders who may have become dependent upon these accessory muscles. There have been postmarketing reports of serious breathing difficulties, including respiratory failure. Patients with smaller neck muscle mass and patients who require bilateral injections into the sternocleidomastoid muscle for the treatment of cervical dystonia have been reported to be at greater risk for dysphagia. Limiting the dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle may reduce the occurrence of dysphagia. Injections into the levator scapulae may be associated with an increased risk of upper respiratory infection and dysphagia. Patients treated with botulinum toxin may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.7 Pulmonary Effects of BOTOX in Patients with Compromised Respiratory Status Treated for Spasticity or for Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition Patients with compromised respiratory status treated with BOTOX for upper limb spasticity should be monitored closely. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in patients with stable reduced pulmonary function (defined as FEV1 40-80% of predicted value and FEV1/FVC ≤ 0.75), the event rate in change of Forced Vital Capacity ≥15% or ≥20% was generally greater in patients treated with BOTOX than in patients treated with placebo (see Table 4). Table 4: Event rate per patient treatment cycle among patients with reduced lung function who experienced at least a 15% or 20% decrease in forced vital capacity from baseline at Week 1, 6, 12 post-injection with up to two treatment cycles with BOTOX or placebo BOTOX 360 Units BOTOX 240 Units Placebo ≥15% ≥20% ≥15% ≥20% ≥15% ≥20% Week 1 4% 0% 3% 0% 7% 3% Week 6 7% 4% 4% 2% 2% 2% Week 12 10% 5% 2% 1% 4% 1% Differences from placebo were not statistically significant In patients with reduced lung function, upper respiratory tract infections were also reported more frequently as adverse reactions in patients treated with BOTOX than in patients treated with placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. In an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in adult patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and restrictive lung disease of neuromuscular etiology [defined as FVC 50-80% of predicted value in patients with spinal cord injury between C5 and C8, or MS] the event rate in change of Forced Vital Capacity ≥15% or ≥20% was generally greater in patients treated with BOTOX than in patients treated with placebo (see Table 5). Table 5: Number and percent of patients experiencing at least a 15% or 20% decrease in FVC from baseline at Week 2, 6, 12 post-injection with BOTOX or placebo BOTOX 200 Units Placebo ≥15% ≥20% ≥15% ≥20% Week 2 0/12 (0%) 0/12 (0%) 1/11 (9%) 0/11 (0%) Week 6 2/11 (18%) 1/11 (9%) 0/11 (0%) 0/11 (0%) Week 12 0/11 (0%) 0/11 (0%) 0/6 (0%) 0/6 (0%) 5.8 Corneal Exposure and Ulceration in Patients Treated with BOTOX for Blepharospasm Reduced blinking from BOTOX injection of the orbicularis muscle can lead to corneal exposure, persistent epithelial defect, and corneal ulceration, especially in patients with VII nerve disorders. Vigorous treatment of any epithelial defect should be employed. This may require protective drops, ointment, therapeutic soft contact lenses, or closure of the eye by patching or other means. 5.9 Retrobulbar Hemorrhages in Patients Treated with BOTOX for Strabismus During the administration of BOTOX for the treatment of strabismus, retrobulbar hemorrhages sufficient to compromise retinal circulation have occurred. It is recommended that appropriate instruments to decompress the orbit be accessible. 5.10 Bronchitis and Upper Respiratory Tract Infections in Patients Treated for Spasticity Bronchitis was reported more frequently as an adverse reaction in patients treated for upper limb spasticity with BOTOX (3% at 251 Units-360 Units total dose), compared to placebo (1%). In patients with reduced lung function treated for upper limb spasticity, upper respiratory tract infections were also reported more frequently as adverse reactions in patients treated with BOTOX (11% at 360 Units total dose; 8% at 240 Units total dose) compared to placebo (6%). 5.11 Autonomic Dysreflexia in Patients Treated for Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition Autonomic dysreflexia associated with intradetrusor injections of BOTOX could occur in patients treated for detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition and may require prompt medical therapy. In clinical trials, the incidence of autonomic dysreflexia was greater in patients treated with BOTOX 200 Units compared with placebo (1.5% versus 0.4%, respectively). 5.12 Urinary Tract Infections in Patients with Overactive Bladder BOTOX increases the incidence of urinary tract infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Clinical trials for overactive bladder excluded patients with more than 2 UTIs in the past 6 months and those taking antibiotics chronically due to recurrent UTIs. Use of BOTOX for the treatment of overactive bladder in such patients and in patients with multiple recurrent UTIs during treatment should only be considered when the benefit is likely to outweigh the potential risk. 5.13 Urinary Retention in Patients Treated for Bladder Dysfunction Due to the risk of urinary retention, treat only patients who are willing and able to initiate catheterization post-treatment, if required, for urinary retention. In patients who are not catheterizing, post-void residual (PVR) urine volume should be assessed within 2 weeks post-treatment and periodically as medically appropriate up to 12 weeks, particularly in patients with multiple sclerosis or diabetes mellitus. Depending on patient symptoms, institute catheterization if PVR urine volume exceeds 200 mL and continue until PVR falls below 200 mL. Instruct patients to contact their physician if they experience difficulty in voiding as catheterization may be required. The incidence and duration of urinary retention is described below for patients with overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition who received BOTOX or placebo injections. Overactive Bladder In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with OAB, the proportion of subjects who initiated clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX or placebo is shown in Table 6. The duration of post-injection catheterization for those who developed urinary retention is also shown. Table 6: Proportion of Patients Catheterizing for Urinary Retention and Duration of Catheterization following an injection in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in OAB Timepoint BOTOX 100 Units (N=552) Placebo (N=542) Proportion of Patients Catheterizing for Urinary Retention At any time during complete treatment cycle 6.5% (n=36) 0.4% (n=2) Duration of Catheterization for Urinary Retention (Days) Median 63 11 Min, Max 1, 214 3, 18 Patients with diabetes mellitus treated with BOTOX were more likely to develop urinary retention than those without diabetes, as shown in Table 7. Table 7. Proportion of Patients Experiencing Urinary Retention following an injection in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in OAB according to history of Diabetes Mellitus Patients with Diabetes Patients without Diabetes BOTOX 100 Units (N=81) Placebo (N=69) BOTOX 100 Units (N=526) Placebo (N=516) Urinary retention 12.3% (n=10) 0 6.3% (n=33) 0.6% (n=3) Detrusor Overactivity associated with a Neurologic Condition In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurologic condition, the proportion of subjects who were not using clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) prior to injection and who subsequently required catheterization for urinary retention following treatment with BOTOX or placebo is shown in Table 8. The duration of post-injection catheterization for those who developed urinary retention is also shown. Table 8: Proportion of Patients not using CIC at baseline and then Catheterizing for Urinary Retention and Duration of Catheterization following an injection in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials Timepoint BOTOX 200 Units (N=108) Placebo (N=104) Proportion of Patients Catheterizing for Urinary Retention At any time during complete treatment cycle 30.6% (n=33) 6.7% (n=7) Duration of Catheterization for Urinary Retention (Days) Median 289 358 Min, Max 1, 530 2, 379 Among patients not using CIC at baseline, those with MS were more likely to require CIC post-injection than those with SCI (see Table 9). Table 9: Proportion of Patients by Etiology (MS and SCI) not using CIC at baseline and then Catheterizing for Urinary Retention following an injection in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials Timepoint MS SCI BOTOX 200 Units (N=86) Placebo (N=88) BOTOX 200 Units (N=22) Placebo (N=16) At any time during complete treatment cycle 31% (n=27) 5% (n=4) 27% (n=6) 19% (n=3) 5.14 Human Albumin and Transmission of Viral Diseases This product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is also considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been reported for albumin."

Patients receiving concomitant treatment of BOTOX Cosmetic and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like agents), or muscle relaxants, should be observed closely because the effect of BOTOX Cosmetic may be potentiated (7) 7.1 Aminoglycosides and Other Agents Interfering with Neuromuscular Transmission Co-administration of BOTOX Cosmetic and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated. 7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs Use of anticholinergic drugs after administration of BOTOX Cosmetic may potentiate systemic anticholinergic effects. 7.3 Other Botulinum Neurotoxin Products The effect of administering different botulinum neurotoxin products at the same time or within several months of each other is unknown. Excessive neuromuscular weakness may be exacerbated by administration of another botulinum toxin prior to the resolution of the effects of a previously administered botulinum toxin. 7.4 Muscle Relaxants Excessive weakness may also be exaggerated by administration of a muscle relaxant before or after administration of BOTOX Cosmetic."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions to BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Spread of Toxin Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] The most common adverse reactions are (6.1): Glabellar Lines: eyelid ptosis (3%) Lateral Canthal Lines: eyelid edema (1%) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Allergan at 1-800-433-8871 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic contain the same active ingredient in the same formulation, but have different labeled Indications and Usage. Therefore, adverse events observed with the use of BOTOX also have the potential to be observed with the use of BOTOX Cosmetic. In general, adverse reactions occur within the first week following injection of BOTOX Cosmetic and while generally transient, may have a duration of several months or longer. Localized pain, infection, inflammation, tenderness, swelling, erythema, and/or bleeding/bruising may be associated with the injection. Needle-related pain and/or anxiety may result in vasovagal responses (including e.g., syncope, hypotension), which may require appropriate medical therapy. Local weakness of the injected muscle(s) represents the expected pharmacological action of botulinum toxin. However, weakness of nearby muscles may also occur due to spread of toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Glabellar Lines Table 2 lists selected adverse reactions reported by ≥1% of BOTOX Cosmetic treated subjects (N=405) aged 18 to 75 who were evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies to assess the use of BOTOX Cosmetic in the improvement of the appearance of glabellar lines.

Treatment with botulinum toxins may result in the formation of neutralizing antibodies that may reduce the effectiveness of subsequent treatments by inactivating biological activity of the toxin. In three Lateral Canthal Line trials, 916 subjects (517 subjects at 24 Units and 399 subjects at 44 Units) treated with BOTOX Cosmetic had specimens analyzed for antibody formation. Among the 916 BOTOX Cosmetic treated subjects, 14 subjects (1.5%) developed binding antibodies and no subjects (0%) developed the presence of neutralizing antibodies. The data reflect the subjects whose test results were considered positive or negative for neutralizing activity to BOTOX Cosmetic in a mouse protection assay. The results of these tests are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to BOTOX Cosmetic with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. The critical factors for neutralizing antibody formation have not been well characterized. The results from some studies suggest that botulinum toxin injections at more frequent intervals or at higher doses may lead to greater incidence of antibody formation. The potential for antibody formation may be minimized by injecting with the lowest effective dose given at the longest feasible intervals between injections. 6.3 Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. There have been spontaneous reports of death, sometimes associated with dysphagia, pneumonia, and/or other significant debility or anaphylaxis, after treatment with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.7)]. There have also been reports of adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, some with fatal outcomes. Some of these patients had risk factors including cardiovascular disease. New onset or recurrent seizures have also been reported, typically in patients who are predisposed to experiencing these events. The following adverse reactions by System Organ Class have been identified during post-approval use of BOTOX/BOTOX Cosmetic: Ear and labyrinth disorders Hypoacusis; tinnitus; vertigo Eye disorders Diplopia; lagophthalmos; strabismus; visual disturbances; vision blurred Gastrointestinal disorders Abdominal pain; diarrhea; dry mouth; nausea; vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions Denervation; malaise; pyrexia Metabolism and nutrition disorders Anorexia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Muscle atrophy; myalgia Nervous system disorders Brachial plexopathy; dysarthria; facial palsy; hypoaesthesia; localized numbness; myasthenia gravis; paresthesia; peripheral neuropathy; radiculopathy; syncope Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Aspiration pneumonia; dyspnea; respiratory depression and/or respiratory failure Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Alopecia, including madarosis; hyperhidrosis; pruritus; skin rash (including erythema multiforme, dermatitis psoriasiform, and psoriasiform eruption)"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potency Units of BOTOX Cosmetic are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products (5.1, 11) Spread of toxin effects; swallowing and breathing difficulties can lead to death. Seek immediate medical attention if respiratory, speech or swallowing difficulties occur (5.2, 5.7) Potential serious adverse reactions after BOTOX injections for unapproved uses (5.3) Adverse event reports have been received involving the cardiovascular system, some with fatal outcomes. Use caution when administering to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. (5.5) Concomitant neuromuscular disorder may exacerbate clinical effects of treatment (5.6) Use with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function or dysphagia (5.7) 5.1 Lack of Interchangeability between Botulinum Toxin Products The potency Units of BOTOX Cosmetic are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX Cosmetic cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Description (11)]. 5.2 Spread of Toxin Effect Postmarketing safety data from BOTOX Cosmetic and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children, and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia and upper limb spasticity. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders occur. No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with dermatologic use of BOTOX/BOTOX Cosmetic at the labeled dose of 20 Units (for glabellar lines), 24 Units (for lateral canthal lines), 44 Units (for simultaneous treatment of lateral canthal lines and glabellar lines), or 100 Units (for severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) have been reported. No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with BOTOX for blepharospasm at the recommended dose (30 Units and below), strabismus, or chronic migraine at the labeled doses have been reported. 5.3 Serious Adverse Reactions with Unapproved Use Serious adverse reactions, including excessive weakness, dysphagia, and aspiration pneumonia, with some adverse reactions associated with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received BOTOX injections for unapproved uses. In these cases, the adverse reactions were not necessarily related to distant spread of toxin, but may have resulted from the administration of BOTOX to the site of injection and/or adjacent structures. In several of the cases, patients had pre-existing dysphagia or other significant disabilities. There is insufficient information to identify factors associated with an increased risk for adverse reactions associated with the unapproved uses of BOTOX. The safety and effectiveness of BOTOX for unapproved uses have not been established. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and/or immediate hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. These reactions include anaphylaxis, serum sickness, urticaria, soft tissue edema, and dyspnea. If such a reaction occurs, further injection of BOTOX Cosmetic should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted. One fatal case of anaphylaxis has been reported in which lidocaine was used as the diluent, and consequently the causal agent cannot be reliably determined. 5.5 Cardiovascular System There have been reports following administration of BOTOX of adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, some with fatal outcomes. Some of these patients had risk factors including pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Use caution when administering to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. 5.6 Pre-Existing Neuromuscular Disorders Individuals with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) should be monitored when given botulinum toxin. Patients with neuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphonia, dysarthria, severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from onabotulinumtoxinA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 5.7 Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties Treatment with BOTOX and other botulinum toxin products can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. Patients with pre-existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or oropharyngeal muscles that control swallowing or breathing.[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin. Dysphagia may persist for several months, and require use of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised. Treatment with botulinum toxins may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation. This may result in a critical loss of breathing capacity in patients with respiratory disorders who may have become dependent upon these accessory muscles. There have been postmarketing reports of serious breathing difficulties, including respiratory failure. Patients with smaller neck muscle mass and patients who require bilateral injections into the sternocleidomastoid muscle for the treatment of cervical dystonia have been reported to be at greater risk for dysphagia. Limiting the dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle may reduce the occurrence of dysphagia. Injections into the levator scapulae may be associated with an increased risk of upper respiratory infection and dysphagia. Patients treated with botulinum toxin may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 5.8 Pre-existing Conditions at the Injection Site Caution should be used when BOTOX Cosmetic treatment is used in the presence of inflammation at the proposed injection site(s), ptosis, or when excessive weakness or atrophy is present in the targeted muscle(s). 5.9 Corneal Exposure and Ulceration in Patients Treated with BOTOX for Blepharospasm Reduced blinking from BOTOX Cosmetic injection of the orbicularis muscle can lead to corneal exposure, persistent epithelial defect, and corneal ulceration, especially in patients with VII nerve disorders. Vigorous treatment of any epithelial defect should be employed. This may require protective drops, ointment, therapeutic soft contact lenses, or closure of the eye by patching or other means. 5.10 Spatial Disorientation, Double Vision or Past-pointing in Patients Treated for Strabismus Inducing paralysis in one or more extraocular muscles may produce spatial disorientation, double vision or past pointing. Covering the affected eye may alleviate these symptoms. 5.11 Human Albumin and Transmission of Viral Diseases This product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is also considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been reported for albumin."
