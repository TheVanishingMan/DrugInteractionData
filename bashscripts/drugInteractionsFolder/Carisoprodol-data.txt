The data described below are based on 1387 patients pooled from two double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trials in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14) ]. In the study, patients were treated with 350 mg of Carisoprodol Tablets, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74% Caucasian, 16% Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other. There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in the trial. In the study, 2.7%, 2%, and 5.4 %, of patients treated with placebo and 350 mg of Carisoprodol Tablets, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5%, 0.5%, and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo and 350 mg of Carisoprodol Tablets, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions.

There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of Carisoprodol Tablets. Since the sedative effects of Carisoprodol Tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the postmarketing experience with Carisoprodol Tablets, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used Carisoprodol Tablets in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of Carisoprodol Tablets-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of Carisoprodol Tablets dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, Carisoprodol Tablets should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and Carisoprodol Tablets should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. Carisoprodol Tablets and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.3) ]. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received Carisoprodol Tablets. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see OVERDOSAGE (10) ].",

        "Drug Interactions Carisoprodol: The sedative effect of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended (see WARNINGS, Sedation ). Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect of CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol is unknown. Aspirin: Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs or alcohol are administered concomitantly with aspirin. Alcohol: Concomitant use of aspirin with >= 3 alcoholic drinks may increase the risk of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Anticoagulants: Concomitant use of aspirin and anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin, clopidogrel) increase the risk of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Additionally, aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of the international normalized ratio (INR). Antihypertensives: The concomitant administration of aspirin with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta¬-blockers, and diuretics may diminish the hypotensive effects of these anti-¬hypertensive products due to aspirin's inhibition of renal prostaglandins, which may lead to decreased renal blood flow and increased sodium and fluid retention. Concomitant use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Corticosteroids: Concomitant administration of aspirin and corticosteroids may decrease salicylate plasma levels. Methotrexate: Aspirin may enhance the toxicity of methotrexate due to displacement of methotrexate from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduction of the renal clearance of methotrexate. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): The concurrent use of aspirin with selective and nonselective NSAIDs increases the risk of serious GI adverse reactions (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Oral Hypoglycemics Agents: Aspirin may increase the serum glucose-lowering action of insulin and sulfonylureas leading to hypoglycemia. Products that effect urinary pH: Ammonium chloride and other drugs that acidify the urine can elevate plasma salicylate concentrations. In contrast, antacids, by alkalinizing the urine, may decrease plasma salicylate concentrations. Uricosuric Agents: Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of probenecid and sulfinpyrazone. Codeine Phosphate:The sedative effects of codeine phosphate and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, other opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously (see WARNINGS, Respiratory Depression and Sedation )."

There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of CARISOPRODOL. Since the sedative effects of CARISOPRODOL and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic anti-depressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the post marketing experience with CARISOPRODOL, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used CARISOPRODOL in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of CARISOPRODOL-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of CARISOPRODOL dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, CARISOPRODOL should be used with caution in addiction prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and CARISOPRODOL should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. CARISOPRODOL, and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Seizures There have been post marketing reports of seizures in patients who received CARISOPRODOL. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [ see Overdosage (10) ]."

        "Drug Interactions Carisoprodol: The sedative effect of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended (see WARNINGS, Sedation). Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect of CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol is unknown. Aspirin: Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs or alcohol are administered concomitantly with aspirin. Alcohol: Concomitant use of aspirin with >= 3 alcoholic drinks may increase the risk of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Anticoagulants: Concomitant use of aspirin and anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin, clopidogrel) increase the risk of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Additionally, aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of the international normalized ratio (INR). Antihypertensives: The concomitant administration of aspirin with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and diuretics may diminish the hypotensive effects of these anti-hypertensive products due to aspirin's inhibition of renal prostaglandins, which may lead to decreased renal blood flow and increased sodium and fluid retention. Concomitant use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Corticosteroids: Concomitant administration of aspirin and corticosteroids may decrease salicylate plasma levels. Methotrexate: Aspirin may enhance the toxicity of methotrexate due to displacement of methotrexate from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduction of the renal clearance of methotrexate. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): The concurrent use of aspirin with selective and nonselective NSAIDs increases the risk of serious GI adverse reactions (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Oral Hypoglycemics Agents: Aspirin may increase the serum glucose-lowering action of insulin and sulfonylureas leading to hypoglycemia. Products that effect urinary pH: Ammonium chloride and other drugs that acidify the urine can elevate plasma salicylate concentrations. In contrast, antacids, by alkalinizing the urine, may decrease plasma salicylate concentrations. Uricosuric Agents: Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of probenecid and sulfinpyrazone."

The data described below are based on 839 patients pooled from a double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trial in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [ see Clinical Studies ( 14) ]. In the study, patients were treated with 350 mg of carisoprodol, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74 % Caucasian, 16 % Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other. There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in the trial. In the study, 2.7%, and 5.4%, of patients treated with placebo, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5%, and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions.

There have been postmarketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol. Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Abuse, Dependence, and Withdrawal Carisoprodol, the active ingredient in carisoprodol tablets, has been subject to abuse, dependence, withdrawal, misuse, and criminal diversion. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.1, 9.2, 9.3)] . Abuse of carisoprodol poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [see Overdosage ( 10)]. Postmarketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol ) [ see Overdosage ( 10) ]."

The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol is unknown. Aspirin: Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs or alcohol are administered concomitantly with aspirin. Alcohol: Concomitant use of aspirin with >= 3 alcoholic drinks may increase the risk of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Anticoagulants: Concomitant use of aspirin and anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin, clopidogrel) increase the risk of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Additionally, aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of the international normalized ratio (INR). Antihypertensives: The concomitant administration of aspirin with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and diuretics may diminish the hypotensive effects of these anti-hypertensive products due to aspirin's inhibition of renal prostaglandins, which may lead to decreased renal blood flow and increased sodium and fluid retention. Concomitant use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Corticosteroids: Concomitant administration of aspirin and corticosteroids may decrease salicylate plasma levels. Methotrexate: Aspirin may enhance the toxicity of methotrexate due to displacement of methotrexate from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduction of the renal clearance of methotrexate. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): The concurrent use of aspirin with selective and nonselective NSAIDs increases the risk of serious GI adverse reactions (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Oral Hypoglycemics Agents: Aspirin may increase the serum glucose lowering action of insulin and sulfonylureas leading to hypoglycemia. Products that effect urinary pH: Ammonium chloride and other drugs that acidify the urine can elevate plasma salicylate concentrations. In contrast, antacids, by alkalinizing the urine, may decrease plasma salicylate concentrations. Uricosuric Agents: Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of probenecid and sulfinpyrazone. Codeine Phosphate: The sedative effects of codeine phosphate and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, other opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive.

        "Drug Interactions 7.1 CNS Depressants The sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors and Inducers Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coadministration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Coadministration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate.

        "Adverse Reactions 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. The data described below are based on 839 patients pooled from a double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trial in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In the study, patients were treated with 350 mg of carisoprodol, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74 % Caucasian, 16 % Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other. There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in the trial. In the study, 2.7%, and 5.4%, of patients treated with placebo, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5%, and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been reported during postapproval use of carisoprodol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, postural hypotension, and facial flushing [see Overdosage (10)]. Central Nervous System: Drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, tremor, agitation, irritability, headache, depressive reactions, syncope, insomnia, and seizures [see Overdosage (10)]. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, and epigastric discomfort. Hematologic: Leukopenia, pancytopenia"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "Warnings and Precautions 5.1 Sedation Carisoprodol has sedative properties (in the low back pain trials, 13% to 17% of patients who received carisoprodol experienced sedation compared to 6% of patients who received placebo) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)] and may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. There have been postmarketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol. Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously.5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the postmarketing experience with carisoprodol, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used carisoprodol in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been postmarketing adverse event reports of carisoprodol-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of carisoprodol dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, carisoprodol should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and carisoprodol should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. Carisoprodol, and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see Overdosage (10)]."

Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended (see WARNINGS, Sedation). Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Coadministration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect on CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol is unknown. Aspirin Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs or alcohol are administered concomitantly with aspirin. Alcohol: Concomitant use of aspirin with >= 3 alcoholic drinks may increase the risk of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions). Anticoagulants: Concomitant use of aspirin with anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin, clopidogrel) increases the risk of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions). Additionally, aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of the international normalized ratio (INR). Antihypertensives : The concomitant administration of aspirin with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and diuretics may diminish the hypotensive effects of these anti-hypertensive products due to aspirin's inhibition of renal prostaglandins, which may lead to decreased renal blood flow and increased sodium and fluid retention. Concomitant use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Corticosteroids: Concomitant administration of aspirin and corticosteroids may decrease salicylate plasma levels. Methotrexate: Aspirin may enhance the toxicity of methotrexate due to displacement of methotrexate from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduction of the renal clearance of methotrexate. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): The concurrent use of aspirin with selective and nonselective NSAIDs increases the risk of serious GI adverse reactions (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions). Oral Hypoglycemics Agents: Aspirin may increase the serum glucose-lowering action of insulin and sulfonylureas leading to hypoglycemia. Products that effect urinary pH: Ammonium chloride and other drugs that acidify the urine can elevate plasma salicylate concentrations. In contrast, antacids, by alkalinizing the urine, may decrease plasma salicylate concentrations. Uricosuric Agents: Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of probenecid and sulfinpyrazone."

There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of Carisoprodol Tablets. Since the sedative effects of Carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the postmarketing experience with Carisoprodol Tablets, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used Carisoprodol tablets in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of Carisoprodol Tablets-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of Carisoprodol dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, Carisoprodol tablets should be used with caution in addictionprone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and Carisoprodol should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. Carisoprodol Tablets, and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received Carisoprodol Tablets. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see Overdosage (10) ].",

[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1, 9.2, 9.3)]. Abuse of carisoprodol poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [see Overdosage (10)]. Postmarketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol.

Coadministration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Coadministration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect on CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol is unknown."

The data described below are based on 839 patients pooled from a double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trial in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In the study, patients were treated with 350 mg of carisoprodol, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74 % Caucasian, 16 % Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other. There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in the trial. In the study, 2.7%, and 5.4%, of patients treated with placebo, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5%, and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions.

There have been postmarketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol. Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the postmarketing experience with carisoprodol, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used carisoprodol in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been postmarketing adverse event reports of carisoprodol-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of carisoprodol dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, carisoprodol should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and carisoprodol should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. Carisoprodol, and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see Overdosage (10)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Sedation Carisoprodol has sedative properties (in the low back pain trials, 13% to 17% of patients who received carisoprodol experienced sedation compared to 6% of patients who received placebo) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)] and may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. There have been postmarketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol. Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously.5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the postmarketing experience with carisoprodol, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used carisoprodol in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been postmarketing adverse event reports of carisoprodol-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of carisoprodol dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, carisoprodol should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and carisoprodol should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. Carisoprodol, and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see Overdosage (10)]."

Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors and Inducers Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate.

The data described below are based on 910 patients pooled from two double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trials in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In these studies, patients were treated with 350 mg of carisoprodol, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74% Caucasian, 16% Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other. There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in these two trials. In these two studies, 2.7% and 5.4%, of patients treated with placebo and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5% and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions.

Abuse of carisoprodol poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [see Overdosage (10)]. Post-marketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of dug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reproted withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been post-marketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol.

Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors and Inducers Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate.

The data described below are based on 1387 patients pooled from two double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trials in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In these studies, patients were treated with 250 mg of carisoprodol, 350 mg of carisoprodol, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74% Caucasian, 16% Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other. There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in these two trials. In these two studies, 2.7%, 2%, and 5.4% of patients treated with placebo, 250 mg of carisoprodol, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5%, 0.5%, and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, 250 mg of carisoprodol, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions.

There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol. Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Abuse, Dependence, and Withdrawal Carisoprodol has been subject to abuse, dependence, withdrawal, misuse, and criminal diversion. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1, 9.2, 9.3)]. Abuse of carisoprodol poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [see Overdosage (10)]. Post-marketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see Overdosage (10) ]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS - CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) - additive sedative effects (5.1and 7.1) 7.1 CNS Depressants The sedative effects of carisoprodol tablets USP and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Concomitant use of carisoprodol tablets USP and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol tablets USP, is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors and Inducers Carisoprodol USP is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol tablets USP could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol USP and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol tablets USP could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol USP and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect on CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol tablets USP is unknown."

The data described below are based on 1387 patients pooled from two double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trials in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In these studies, patients were treated with 250 mg of carisoprodol tablets USP, 350 mg of carisoprodol tablets USP, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74 % Caucasian, 16 % Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other. There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in these two trials. In these two studies, 2.7%, 2%, and 5.4%, of patients treated with placebo, 250 mg of carisoprodol tablets USP, and 350 mg of carisoprodol tablets USP, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5%, 0.5%, and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, 250 mg of carisoprodol tablets USP, and 350 mg of carisoprodol tablets USP, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions. Table 1 displays adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with carisoprodol tablets USP in the two trials described above.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Due to sedative properties, may impair ability to perform hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery (5.1) - Additive sedative effects when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol (5.1) - Cases of abuse, Dependence, and Withdrawal (5.2, 9.2, 9.3) - Seizures (5.3) 5.1 Sedation Carisoprodol tablets USP has sedative properties (in the low back pain trials, 13% to 17% of patients who received carisoprodol tablets USP experienced sedation compared to 6% of patients who received placebo) [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1 )] and may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol tablets USP. Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol tablets USP and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Abuse, Dependence and Withdrawal Carisoprodol, the active ingredient in carisoprodol tablets USP, has been subject to abuse, dependence, withdrawal, misuse, and criminal diversion. [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1, 9.2, 9.3) ]. Abuse of carisoprodol tablets USP poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Post-marketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol tablets USP after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. To reduce the risk of carisoprodol tablets USP abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been post-marketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol tablets USP. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [ see Overdosage (10 )]."

Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors and Inducers Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect on CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol is unknown."

The data described below are based on 839 patients pooled from two double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trials in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In the study, patients were treated with 350 mg of carisoprodol, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74% Caucasian, 16% Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other. There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in the trial. In the study, 2.7%, and 5.4%, of patients treated with placebo, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5% and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, 250 mg of carisoprodol, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions. Table 1 displays adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with carisoprodol in the two trials described above. Table 1.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Due to sedative properties, may impair ability to perform hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery (5.1) Additive sedative effects when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol (5.1) Cases of Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse (5.2) Seizures (5.3) 5.1 Sedation Carisoprodol may have sedative properties (in the low back pain trials, 13% to 17% of patients who received carisoprodol experienced sedation compared to 6% of patients who received placebo) [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ] and may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol. Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the postmarketing experience with carisoprodol, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used carisoprodol in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of carisoprodol-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of carisoprodol dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, carisoprodol should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and carisoprodol should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. Carisoprodol and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see Overdosage (10) ]."

        "Drug Interactions Carisoprodol: The sedative effect of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Concomitant use of carisoprodol and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol, is not recommended (see WARNINGS, Sedation ). Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect of CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol is unknown. Aspirin: Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs or alcohol are administered concomitantly with aspirin. Alcohol: Concomitant use of aspirin with >= 3 alcoholic drinks may increase the risk of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Anticoagulants: Concomitant use of aspirin and anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin, clopidogrel) increase the risk of GI bleeding (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Additionally, aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of the international normalized ratio (INR). Antihypertensives: The concomitant administration of aspirin with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and diuretics may diminish the hypotensive effects of these anti-hypertensive products due to aspirin's inhibition of renal prostaglandins, which may lead to decreased renal blood flow and increased sodium and fluid retention. Concomitant use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. Corticosteroids: Concomitant administration of aspirin and corticosteroids may decrease salicylate plasma levels. Methotrexate: Aspirin may enhance the toxicity of methotrexate due to displacement of methotrexate from its plasma protein binding sites and/or reduction of the renal clearance of methotrexate. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): The concurrent use of aspirin with selective and nonselective NSAIDs increases the risk of serious GI adverse reactions (see WARNINGS, Serious Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions ). Oral Hypoglycemics Agents: Aspirin may increase the serum glucose lowering action of insulin and sulfonylureas leading to hypoglycemia. Products that effect urinary pH: Ammonium chloride and other drugs that acidify the urine can elevate plasma salicylate concentrations. In contrast, antacids, by alkalinizing the urine, may decrease plasma salicylate concentrations. Uricosuric Agents: Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of probenecid and sulfinpyrazone."

Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol.

Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Abuse, Dependence, and Withdrawal Carisoprodol has been subject to abuse, dependence, withdrawal, misuse, and criminal diversion. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1, 9.2, 9.3)]. Abuse of carisoprodol poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [see Overdosage (10)]. Post-marketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see Overdosage (10) ]."

        "Drug Interactions Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs are administered concomitantly with aspirin or aspirin-containing drugs. 1. Oral Anticoagulants-By interfering with platelet function or decreasing plasma prothrombin concentration, aspirin enhances the potential for bleeding in patients on anticoagulants. 2. Methotrexate-aspirin enhances the toxic effects of this drug. 3. Probenecid and Sulfinpyrazone-large doses of aspirin reduce the uricosuric effect of both drugs. Renal excretion of salicylate may also be reduced. 4. Oral Antidiabetic Drugs-enhancement of hypoglycemia may occur. 5. Antacids-to the extent that they raise urinary pH, antacids may substantially decrease plasma salicylate concentrations; conversely, their withdrawal can result in a substantial increase. 6. Ammonium Chloride-this and other drugs that acidify a relatively alkaline urine can elevate plasma salicylate concentrations. 7. Ethyl Alcohol-enhanced aspirin-induced fecal blood loss has been reported. 8. Corticosteroids-salicylate plasma levels may be decreased when adrenal corticosteroids are given, and may be increased substantially when they are discontinued."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS If severe reactions occur, discontinue Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets and initiate appropriate symptomatic and supportive therapy. The following side effects which have occurred with the administration of the individual ingredients alone may also occur with the combination. Carisoprodol: Central Nervous System: Drowsiness is the most frequent complaint and along with other CNS effects may require dosage reduction. Observed less frequently are dizziness, vertigo and ataxia. Tremor, agitation, irritability, headache, depressive reactions, syncope and insomnia have been infrequent or rare. Idiosyncratic: Idiosyncratic reactions are very rare. They are usually seen within the period of the first to fourth dose in patients having had no previous contact with the drug (see WARNINGS). Allergic: Skin rash erythema multiforme, pruritus, eosinophilia and fixed drug eruptions with cross-reaction to meprobamate have been reported. If allergic reactions occur, discontinue Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets and treat symptomatically. In evaluating possible allergic reactions, also consider allergy to excipients. Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, postural hypotension and facial flushing. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress and hiccup. Hematologic: No serious blood dyscrasias have been attributed to carisoprodol alone. Leukopenia and pancytopenia have been reported, very rarely, in situations in which other drugs or viral infections may have been responsible. Aspirin: The most common adverse reactions associated with the use of aspirin have been gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, gastritis, occult bleeding, constipation and diarrhea. Gastric erosion, angioedema, asthma rash, pruritus and urticaria have been reported less commonly. Tinnitus is a sign of high serum salicylate levels (see OVERDOSAGE). Aspirin Intolerance: Allergic type reactions in aspirin-sensitive individuals may involve the respiratory tract or the skin. Symptoms of the former range from rhinorrhea and shortness of breath to severe asthma, and the latter may consist of urticaria, edema, rash or angioedema (giant hives). These may occur independently or in combination."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Due to sedative properties, may impair ability to perform hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery (5.1) Additive sedative effects when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol (5.1) Cases of Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse (5.2) Seizures (5.3) 5.1 Sedation SOMA has sedative properties (in the low back pain trials, 13% to 17% of patients who received SOMA experienced sedation compared to 6% of patients who received placebo) [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ] and may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of SOMA. Since the sedative effects of SOMA and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the postmarketing experience with SOMA, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used SOMA in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of SOMA-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of SOMA dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, SOMA should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and SOMA should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. SOMA, and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received SOMA. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [ see Overdosage (10) ]."

[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1, 9.2, 9.3)]. Abuse of carisoprodol poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [see Overdosage (10)]. Post-marketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol.

Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Concomitant use of CARISOPRODOL and meprobamate, a metabolite of CARISOPRODOL, is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors and Inducers Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with CARISOPRODOL could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with CARISOPRODOL could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed induction effect on CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of CARISOPRODOL is unknown."

The data described below are based on 839 patients pooled from two double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trials in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In these studies, patients were treated with 350 mg of CARISOPRODOL, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74% Caucasian, 16% Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other. There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in these two trials. In these two studies, 2.7%, and 5.4%, of patients treated with placebo and 350 mg of CARISOPRODOL, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5%, and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo and 350 mg of CARISOPRODOL, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions. Table 1 displays adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with CARISOPRODOL in the two trials described above. Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, postural hypotension, and facial flushing [ see Overdosage (10) ]. Central Nervous System: Drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, tremor, agitation, irritability, headache, depressive reactions, syncope, insomnia, and seizures [ see Overdosage (10) ].

There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of CARISOPRODOL. Since the sedative effects of CARISOPRODOL and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic anti-depressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the post marketing experience with CARISOPRODOL, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used CARISOPRODOL in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of CARISOPRODOL-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of CARISOPRODOL dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, CARISOPRODOL should be used with caution in addiction prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and CARISOPRODOL should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. CARISOPRODOL, and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Seizures There have been post marketing reports of seizures in patients who received CARISOPRODOL. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [ see Overdosage (10) ]."

There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol. Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Abuse, Dependence, and Withdrawal Carisoprodol has been subject to abuse, dependence, withdrawal, misuse, and criminal diversion. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1, 9.2, 9.3)]. Abuse of carisoprodol poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [see Overdosage (10)]. Post-marketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see Overdosage (10) ]."

There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of CARISOPRODOL. Since the sedative effects of CARISOPRODOL and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic anti-depressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the post marketing experience with CARISOPRODOL, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used CARISOPRODOL in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of CARISOPRODOL-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of CARISOPRODOL dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, CARISOPRODOL should be used with caution in addiction prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and CARISOPRODOL should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. CARISOPRODOL, and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may cause dependence. [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Seizures There have been post marketing reports of seizures in patients who received CARISOPRODOL. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [ see Overdosage (10) ]."

[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1, 9.2, 9.3)]. Abuse of carisoprodol poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [see Overdosage (10)]. Post-marketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol.

        "Drug Interactions Clinically important interactions may occur when certain drugs are administered concomitantly with aspirin or aspirin-containing drugs. 1. Oral Anticoagulants-By interfering with platelet function or decreasing plasma prothrombin concentration, aspirin enhances the potential for bleeding in patients on anticoagulants. 2. Methotrexate-aspirin enhances the toxic effects of this drug. 3. Probenecid and Sulfinpyrazone-large doses of aspirin reduce the uricosuric effect of both drugs. Renal excretion of salicylate may also be reduced. 4. Oral Antidiabetic Drugs-enhancement of hypoglycemia may occur. 5. Antacids-to the extent that they raise urinary pH, antacids may substantially decrease plasma salicylate concentrations; conversely, their withdrawal can result in a substantial increase. 6. Ammonium Chloride-this and other drugs that acidify a relatively alkaline urine can elevate plasma salicylate concentrations. 7. Ethyl Alcohol-enhanced aspirin-induced fecal blood loss has been reported. 8. Corticosteroids-salicylate plasma levels may be decreased when adrenal corticosteroids are given, and may be increased substantially when they are discontinued."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS If severe reactions occur, discontinue Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets and initiate appropriate symptomatic and supportive therapy. The following side effects which have occurred with the administration of the individual ingredients alone may also occur with the combination. Carisoprodol: Central Nervous System: Drowsiness is the most frequent complaint and along with other CNS effects may require dosage reduction. Observed less frequently are dizziness, vertigo and ataxia. Tremor, agitation, irritability, headache, depressive reactions, syncope and insomnia have been infrequent or rare. Idiosyncratic: Idiosyncratic reactions are very rare. They are usually seen within the period of the first to fourth dose in patients having had no previous contact with the drug (see WARNINGS). Allergic: Skin rash erythema multiforme, pruritus, eosinophilia and fixed drug eruptions with cross-reaction to meprobamate have been reported. If allergic reactions occur, discontinue Carisoprodol and Aspirin Tablets and treat symptomatically. In evaluating possible allergic reactions, also consider allergy to excipients. Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, postural hypotension and facial flushing. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress and hiccup. Hematologic: No serious blood dyscrasias have been attributed to carisoprodol alone. Leukopenia and pancytopenia have been reported, very rarely, in situations in which other drugs or viral infections may have been responsible. Aspirin: The most common adverse reactions associated with the use of aspirin have been gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, gastritis, occult bleeding, constipation and diarrhea. Gastric erosion, angioedema, asthma rash, pruritus and urticaria have been reported less commonly. Tinnitus is a sign of high serum salicylate levels (see OVERDOSAGE). Aspirin Intolerance: Allergic type reactions in aspirin-sensitive individuals may involve the respiratory tract or the skin. Symptoms of the former range from rhinorrhea and shortness of breath to severe asthma, and the latter may consist of urticaria, edema, rash or angioedema (giant hives). These may occur independently or in combination."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Due to sedative properties, may impair ability to perform hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery (5.1) Additive sedative effects when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol (5.1) Cases of Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse (5.2) Seizures (5.3) 5.1 Sedation SOMA has sedative properties (in the low back pain trials, 13% to 17% of patients who received SOMA experienced sedation compared to 6% of patients who received placebo) [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ] and may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of SOMA. Since the sedative effects of SOMA and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Drug Dependence, Withdrawal, and Abuse In the post-marketing experience with SOMA, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with prolonged use. Most cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used SOMA in combination with other drugs with abuse potential. However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of SOMA-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of SOMA dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, SOMA should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and SOMA should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort. SOMA, and one of its metabolites, meprobamate (both controlled substances), may cause dependence [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.3 Seizures There have been post-marketing reports of seizures in patients who received SOMA. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [ see Overdosage (10) ]."

Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Concomitant use of carisoprodol tablets and meprobamate, a metabolite of carisoprodol tablets, is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors and Inducers Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine, with carisoprodol tablets could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate. Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol tablets could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate. Low dose aspirin also showed an induction effect on CYP2C19. The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of carisoprodol tablets is unknown."

The data described below are based on 1387 patients pooled from two double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trials in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In these studies, patients were treated with 250 mg of carisoprodol tablets, 350 mg of carisoprodol tablets, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74 % Caucasian, 16 % Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other.

[see Drug Abuse and Dependence(9.1, 9.2, 9.3)]. Abuse of carisoprodol tablets poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and other disorders [see Overdosage (10) ]. Post-marketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol tablets after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodol's metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. To reduce the risk of carisoprodol tablets abuse, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been post-marketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol tablets. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [see Overdosage (10) ]."
