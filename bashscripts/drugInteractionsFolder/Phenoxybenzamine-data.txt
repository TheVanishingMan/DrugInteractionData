        "Drug Interactions2 Phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride may interact with compounds that stimulate both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors (i.e., epinephrine) to produce an exaggerated hypotensive response and tachycardia. (See WARNING.) Phenoxybenzamine blocks hyperthermia production by levarterenol, and blocks hypothermia production by reserpine."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been observed, but there are insufficient data to support an estimate of their frequency. Autonomic Nervous System*: Postural hypotension, tachycardia, inhibition of ejaculation, nasal congestion, miosis. *These so-called \"side effects\" are actually evidence of adrenergic blockade and vary according to the degree of blockade. Miscellaneous: Gastrointestinal irritation, drowsiness, fatigue.
