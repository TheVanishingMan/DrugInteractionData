        "DRUG INTERACTIONS This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions with ATRIPLA. Drug interaction trials are described elsewhere in the labeling [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Efavirenz has been shown in vivo to induce CYP3A and CYP2B6. Other compounds that are substrates of CYP3A or CYP2B6 may have decreased plasma concentrations when coadministered with efavirenz. In vitro studies have demonstrated that efavirenz inhibits CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 isozymes in the range of observed efavirenz plasma concentrations. Coadministration of efavirenz with drugs primarily metabolized by these isozymes may result in altered plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug. Therefore, appropriate dose adjustments may be necessary for these drugs. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity (e.g., phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin) would be expected to increase the clearance of efavirenz resulting in lowered plasma concentrations [See Dosage and Administration (2)]. Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of ATRIPLA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, and valganciclovir. Coadministration of tenofovir DF and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions [for didanosine dosing adjustment recommendations, see Table 4]. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir with ATRIPLA should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions [See Table 4]. Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended since coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF has been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of atazanavir. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA [See Table 4]. Other important drug interaction information for ATRIPLA is summarized in Table 1 and Table 4. The drug interactions described are based on trials conducted with efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir DF as individual agents or are potential drug interactions; no drug interaction trials have been conducted using ATRIPLA [for pharmacokinetics data see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Tables 5–9]. The tables include potentially significant interactions, but are not all inclusive. Table 4 Established and Other Potentially Significant* Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Trials or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect Clinical Comment Antiretroviral agents Protease inhibitor: atazanavir ↓atazanavir concentration ↑ tenofovir concentration Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF decreases plasma concentrations of atazanavir. The combined effect of efavirenz plus tenofovir DF on atazanavir plasma concentrations is not known. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA. Protease inhibitor: fosamprenavir calcium ↓ amprenavir concentration Fosamprenavir (unboosted): Appropriate doses of fosamprenavir and ATRIPLA with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir: An additional 100 mg/day (300 mg total) of ritonavir is recommended when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily. No change in the ritonavir dose is required when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir plus ritonavir twice daily. Protease inhibitor: indinavir ↓ indinavir concentration The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz, is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. Protease inhibitor: lopinavir/ritonavir ↓ lopinavir concentration ↑ tenofovir concentration A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir to 600/150 mg (3 tablets) twice daily may be considered when used in combination with efavirenz in treatment-experienced patients where decreased susceptibility to lopinavir is clinically suspected (by treatment history or laboratory evidence). Patients should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Protease inhibitor: ritonavir ↑ ritonavir concentration ↑ efavirenz concentration When ritonavir 500 mg every 12 hours was coadministered with efavirenz 600 mg once daily, the combination was associated with a higher frequency of adverse clinical experiences (e.g., dizziness, nausea, paresthesia) and laboratory abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes). Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when ATRIPLA is used in combination with ritonavir. Protease inhibitor: saquinavir ↓ saquinavir concentration Should not be used as sole protease inhibitor in combination with ATRIPLA. CCR5 co-receptor antagonist: maraviroc ↓ maraviroc concentration Efavirenz decreases plasma concentrations of maraviroc. Refer to the full prescribing information for maraviroc for guidance on coadministration with ATRIPLA. NRTI: didanosine ↑ didanosine concentration Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis and neuropathy. In patients weighing >60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg if coadministered with ATRIPLA. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for patients weighing <60 kg. Coadministration of ATRIPLA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. For additional information, please consult the Videx / Videx EC (didanosine) prescribing information. Other agents Anticoagulant: warfarin ↑ or ↓ warfarin concentration Plasma concentrations and effects potentially increased or decreased by efavirenz. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine ↓ carbamazepine concentration ↓ efavirenz concentration There are insufficient data to make a dose recommendation for ATRIPLA. Alternative anticonvulsant treatment should be used. phenytoin phenobarbital ↓ anticonvulsant concentration ↓ efavirenz concentration Potential for reduction in anticonvulsant and/or efavirenz plasma levels; periodic monitoring of anticonvulsant plasma levels should be conducted. Antidepressants: bupropion ↓ buproprion concentration The effect of efavirenz on bupropion exposure is thought to be due to the induction of bupropion metabolism. Increases in bupropion dosage should be guided by clinical response, but the maximum recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded. sertraline ↓ sertraline concentration Increases in sertraline dose should be guided by clinical response. Antifungals: itraconazole ↓ itraconazole concentration ↓ hydroxy-itraconazole concentration Since no dose recommendation for itraconazole can be made, alternative antifungal treatment should be considered. ketoconazole ↓ ketoconazole concentration Drug interaction trials with ATRIPLA and ketoconazole have not been conducted. Efavirenz has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of ketoconazole. posaconazole ↓ posaconazole concentration Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit outweighs the risks. Anti-infective: clarithromycin ↓ clarithromycin concentration ↑ 14-OH metabolite concentration Clinical significance unknown. In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving efavirenz and clarithromycin. No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is recommended when given with clarithromycin. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Other macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, have not been studied in combination with ATRIPLA. Antimycobacterial: rifabutin ↓ rifabutin concentration Increase daily dose of rifabutin by 50%. Consider doubling the rifabutin dose in regimens where rifabutin is given 2 or 3 times a week. Antimycobacterial: rifampin ↓ efavirenz concentration If ATRIPLA is coadministered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an additional 200 mg/day of efavirenz is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: diltiazem ↓ diltiazem concentration ↓ desacetyl diltiazem concentration ↓ N-monodes-methyl diltiazem concentration Diltiazem dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for diltiazem). No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is necessary when administered with diltiazem. Others (e.g., felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) ↓ calcium channel blocker No data are available on the potential interactions of efavirenz with other calcium channel blockers that are substrates of CYP3A. The potential exists for reduction in plasma concentrations of the calcium channel blocker. Dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for the calcium channel blocker). HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: atorvastatin pravastatin simvastatin ↓ atorvastatin concentration ↓ pravastatin concentration ↓ simvastatin concentration Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin decreased with efavirenz. Consult the full prescribing information for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for guidance on individualizing the dose. Hormonal contraceptives: Oral: ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate ↓ active metabolites of norgestimate A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. Efavirenz had no effect on ethinyl estradiol concentrations, but progestin levels (norelgestromin and levonorgestrel) were markedly decreased. No effect of ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate on efavirenz plasma concentrations was observed. Implant: etonogestrel ↓ etonogestrel A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. The interaction between etonogestrel and efavirenz has not been studied. Decreased exposure of etonogestrel may be expected. There have been postmarketing reports of contraceptive failure with etonogestrel in efavirenz-exposed patients. Immunosuppressants: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and others metabolized by CYP3A ↓ immuno-suppressant Decreased exposure of the immunosuppressant may be expected due to CYP3A induction by efavirenz. These immunosuppressants are not anticipated to affect exposure of efavirenz. Dose adjustments of the immunosuppressant may be required. Close monitoring of immunosuppressant concentrations for at least 2 weeks (until stable concentrations are reached) is recommended when starting or stopping treatment with ATRIPLA. Narcotic analgesic: methadone ↓ methadone concentration Coadministration of efavirenz in HIV-1 infected individuals with a history of injection drug use resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal. Methadone dose was increased by a mean of 22% to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be monitored for signs of withdrawal and their methadone dose increased as required to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. This table is not all inclusive. Cannabinoid Test Interaction: Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have been observed in non-HIV-infected volunteers receiving efavirenz when the Microgenics Cedia DAU Multi-Level THC assay was used for screening. Negative results were obtained when more specific confirmatory testing was performed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. For more information, please consult the SUSTIVA prescribing information."

For additional safety information about SUSTIVA (efavirenz), EMTRIVA (emtricitabine), or VIREAD (tenofovir DF) in combination with other antiretroviral agents, consult the prescribing information for these products. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects Study 934 Study 934 was an open-label active-controlled trial in which 511 antiretroviral-naive subjects received either emtricitabine + tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254). The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934 include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. Adverse reactions observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials of the individual components (Table 2). Table 2 Selected Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions* (Grades 2–4) Reported in ≥5% in Either Treatment Group in Study 934 (0–144 Weeks) FTC + TDF + EFV† AZT/3TC + EFV N=257 N=254 Gastrointestinal Disorder Diarrhea 9% 5% Nausea 9% 7% Vomiting 2% 5% General Disorders and Administration Site Condition Fatigue 9% 8% Infections and Infestations Sinusitis 8% 4% Upper respiratory tract infections 8% 5% Nasopharyngitis 5% 3% Nervous System Disorders Headache 6% 5% Dizziness 8% 7% Psychiatric Disorders Anxiety 5% 4% Depression 9% 7% Insomnia 5% 7% Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash Event‡ 7% 9% Frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug. From Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine + tenofovir DF with efavirenz. Rash event includes rash, exfoliative rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash pruritic, and rash vesicular. Study 073 In Study 073, subjects with stable, virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy and no history of virologic failure were randomized to receive ATRIPLA or to stay on their baseline regimen. The adverse reactions observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those seen in Study 934 and those seen with the individual components of ATRIPLA when each was administered in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, or Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate In addition to the adverse reactions in Study 934 and Study 073 the following adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Efavirenz: The most significant adverse reactions observed in subjects treated with efavirenz are nervous system symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], psychiatric symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], and rash [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Selected adverse reactions of moderate-severe intensity observed in greater than or equal to 2% of efavirenz-treated subjects in two controlled clinical trials included pain, impaired concentration, abnormal dreams, somnolence, anorexia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nervousness, and pruritus. Pancreatitis has also been reported, although a causal relationship with efavirenz has not been established. Asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels were observed in a significantly higher number of subjects treated with efavirenz 600 mg than in control subjects. Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials include arthralgia, increased cough, dyspepsia, fever, myalgia, pain, abdominal pain, back pain, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), pneumonia, rhinitis and rash event (including rash, pruritus, maculopapular rash, urticaria, vesiculobullous rash, pustular rash and allergic reaction). Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects Efavirenz: In a pediatric clinical trial in 57 NRTI-experienced subjects aged 3 to 16 years, the type and frequency of adverse experiences was generally similar to that of adult subjects with the exception of a higher incidence of rash, which was reported in 46% (26/57) of pediatric subjects compared to 26% of adults, and a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 rash reported in 5% (3/57) of pediatric subjects compared to 0.9% of adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. For additional information, please consult the SUSTIVA prescribing information. Emtricitabine: In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with emtricitabine in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, please consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a pediatric clinical trial conducted in subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with tenofovir DF were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of tenofovir DF in adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Laboratory abnormalities observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials (Table 3). Table 3 Significant Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in ≥1% of Subjects in Either Treatment Group in Study 934 (0–144 Weeks) FTC + TDF + EFV* AZT/3TC + EFV N=257 N=254 Any ≥ Grade 3 Laboratory Abnormality 30% 26% Fasting Cholesterol (>240 mg/dL) 22% 24% Creatine Kinase (M: >990 U/L) (F: >845 U/L) 9% 7% Serum Amylase (>175 U/L) 8% 4% Alkaline Phosphatase (>550 U/L) 1% 0% AST (M: >180 U/L) (F: >170 U/L) 3% 3% ALT (M: >215 U/L) (F: >170 U/L) 2% 3% Hemoglobin (<8.0 mg/dL) 0% 4% Hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL) 2% 1% Hematuria (>75 RBC/HPF) 3% 2% Glycosuria (≥3+) <1% 1% Neutrophils (<750/mm3) 3% 5% Fasting Triglycerides (>750 mg/dL) 4% 2% From Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine + tenofovir DF with efavirenz. Laboratory abnormalities observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those in Study 934. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described for Study 934 (Table 3), Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (greater than 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)), increased pancreatic amylase (greater than 2.0 × ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (less than 40 or greater than 250 mg/dL), and increased serum lipase (greater than 2.0 × ULN) occurred in up to 3% of subjects treated with emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Hepatic Events: In Study 934, 19 subjects treated with efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF and 20 subjects treated with efavirenz and fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine were hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody positive. Among these coinfected subjects, one subject (1/19) in the efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF arm had elevations in transaminases to greater than five times ULN through 144 weeks. In the fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine arm, two subjects (2/20) had elevations in transaminases to greater than five times ULN through 144 weeks. No HBV and/or HCV coinfected subject discontinued from the trial due to hepatobiliary disorders [See Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Efavirenz: Cardiac Disorders Palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Tinnitus, vertigo Endocrine Disorders Gynecomastia Eye Disorders Abnormal vision Gastrointestinal Disorders Constipation, malabsorption General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Asthenia Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatic enzyme increase, hepatic failure, hepatitis. A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, were characterized by a fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death. Immune System Disorders Allergic reactions Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [See Warnings and Precautions (5.14)], hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia, myalgia, myopathy Nervous System Disorders Abnormal coordination, ataxia, cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, convulsions, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, neuropathy, tremor Psychiatric Disorders Aggressive reactions, agitation, delusions, emotional lability, mania, neurosis, paranoia, psychosis, suicide Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Flushing, erythema multiforme, photoallergic dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome Emtricitabine: No postmarketing adverse reactions have been identified for inclusion in this section.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious psychiatric symptoms: Immediate medical evaluation is recommended. (5.5, 6.1) Nervous system symptoms (NSS): NSS are frequent, usually begin 1–2 days after initiating therapy and resolve in 2–4 weeks. Dosing at bedtime may improve tolerability. NSS are not predictive of onset of psychiatric symptoms. (2, 5.6) New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CrCl) before initiating treatment with ATRIPLA. Monitor CrCl and serum phosphorus in patients at risk. Avoid administering ATRIPLA with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.7) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. A pregnancy registry is available. (5.8, 8.1) Rash: Discontinue if severe rash develops. (5.9, 6.1) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment in patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C coinfection, marked transaminase elevations, or who are taking medications associated with liver toxicity. Among reported cases of hepatic failure, a few occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease. (5.10, 6.3, 8.6) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathological fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.11) Convulsions: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures. (5.12) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.13) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.14) Coadministration with other products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, or VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. SUSTIVA (efavirenz) should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless required for dose-adjustment when coadministered with rifampin. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs including tenofovir DF, a component of ATRIPLA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with ATRIPLA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic HBV before initiating antiretroviral therapy. ATRIPLA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, and the safety and efficacy of ATRIPLA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of ATRIPLA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with emtricitabine, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow up for at least several months after stopping treatment with ATRIPLA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. ATRIPLA should not be administered with HEPSERA® (adefovir dipivoxil) [See Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Efavirenz plasma concentrations may be altered by substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A. Likewise, efavirenz may alter plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2B6 [See Contraindications (4.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Related drugs not for coadministration with ATRIPLA include COMPLERA (emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF), EMTRIVA (emtricitabine), TRUVADA (emtricitabine/tenofovir DF), and VIREAD (tenofovir DF), which contain the same active components as ATRIPLA. SUSTIVA (efavirenz) should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless needed for dose-adjustment (e.g. with rifampin) [See Dosage and Administration (2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, ATRIPLA should not be coadministered with drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir, or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). Serious psychiatric adverse experiences have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. In controlled trials of 1008 subjects treated with regimens containing efavirenz for a mean of 2.1 years and 635 subjects treated with control regimens for a mean of 1.5 years, the frequency (regardless of causality) of specific serious psychiatric events among subjects who received efavirenz or control regimens, respectively, were: severe depression (2.4%, 0.9%), suicidal ideation (0.7%, 0.3%), nonfatal suicide attempts (0.5%, 0%), aggressive behavior (0.4%, 0.5%), paranoid reactions (0.4%, 0.3%), and manic reactions (0.2%, 0.3%). When psychiatric symptoms similar to those noted above were combined and evaluated as a group in a multifactorial analysis of data from Study AI266006 (006), treatment with efavirenz was associated with an increase in the occurrence of these selected psychiatric symptoms. Other factors associated with an increase in the occurrence of these psychiatric symptoms were history of injection drug use, psychiatric history, and receipt of psychiatric medication at trial entry; similar associations were observed in both the efavirenz and control treatment groups. In Study 006, onset of new serious psychiatric symptoms occurred throughout the trial for both efavirenz-treated and control-treated subjects. One percent of efavirenz-treated subjects discontinued or interrupted treatment because of one or more of these selected psychiatric symptoms. There have also been occasional postmarketing reports of death by suicide, delusions, and psychosis-like behavior, although a causal relationship to the use of efavirenz cannot be determined from these reports. Patients with serious psychiatric adverse experiences should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits [See Adverse Reactions (6)]. Fifty-three percent (531/1008) of subjects receiving efavirenz in controlled trials reported central nervous system symptoms (any grade, regardless of causality) compared to 25% (156/635) of subjects receiving control regimens. These symptoms included dizziness (28.1% of the 1008 subjects), insomnia (16.3%), impaired concentration (8.3%), somnolence (7.0%), abnormal dreams (6.2%), and hallucinations (1.2%). Other reported symptoms were euphoria, confusion, agitation, amnesia, stupor, abnormal thinking, and depersonalization. The majority of these symptoms were mild-moderate (50.7%); symptoms were severe in 2.0% of subjects. Overall, 2.1% of subjects discontinued therapy as a result. These symptoms usually begin during the first or second day of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2–4 weeks of therapy. After 4 weeks of therapy, the prevalence of nervous system symptoms of at least moderate severity ranged from 5% to 9% in subjects treated with regimens containing efavirenz and from 3% to 5% in subjects treated with a control regimen. Patients should be informed that these common symptoms were likely to improve with continued therapy and were not predictive of subsequent onset of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of these nervous system symptoms [See Dosage and Administration (2)]. Analysis of long-term data from Study 006, (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for subjects treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated subjects were generally similar to those in the indinavir-containing control arm. Patients receiving ATRIPLA should be alerted to the potential for additive central nervous system effects when ATRIPLA is used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms such as dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or drowsiness should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney; however, efavirenz is not. Since ATRIPLA is a combination product and the dose of the individual components cannot be altered, patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min should not receive ATRIPLA. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. It is recommended that creatinine clearance be calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with ATRIPLA. Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in patients at risk for renal impairment, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA. ATRIPLA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. Pregnancy Category D: Efavirenz may cause fetal harm when administered during the first trimester to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving ATRIPLA. Barrier contraception must always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (e.g., oral or other hormonal contraceptives). Because of the long half-life of efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of ATRIPLA is recommended. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of ATRIPLA. If this drug is used during the first trimester of pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of ATRIPLA in pregnant women. ATRIPLA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus, such as in pregnant women without other therapeutic options [See Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. In controlled clinical trials, 26% (266/1008) of subjects treated with 600 mg efavirenz experienced new-onset skin rash compared with 17% (111/635) of subjects treated in control groups. Rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation, or ulceration occurred in 0.9% (9/1008) of subjects treated with efavirenz. The incidence of Grade 4 rash (e.g., erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in subjects treated with efavirenz in all trials and expanded access was 0.1%. Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 2 weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz (median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days) and, in most subjects continuing therapy with efavirenz, rash resolves within 1 month (median duration, 16 days). The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was 1.7% (17/1008). ATRIPLA can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement, or fever. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. Experience with efavirenz in subjects who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited. Nineteen subjects who discontinued nevirapine because of rash have been treated with efavirenz. Nine of these subjects developed mild-to-moderate rash while receiving therapy with efavirenz, and two of these subjects discontinued because of rash. Rash was reported in 26 of 57 pediatric subjects (46%) treated with efavirenz [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. One pediatric subject experienced Grade 3 rash (confluent rash with fever), and two subjects had Grade 4 rash (erythema multiforme). The median time to onset of rash in pediatric subjects was 8 days. Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines before initiating therapy with ATRIPLA in pediatric patients should be considered. Monitoring of liver enzymes before and during treatment is recommended for patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C infection; patients with marked transaminase elevations; and patients treated with other medications associated with liver toxicity [See also Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Liver enzyme monitoring should also be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. In patients with persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued therapy with ATRIPLA needs to be weighed against the unknown risks of significant liver toxicity [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) should be considered for patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. In a 144-week trial of treatment-naive adult subjects receiving tenofovir DF, decreases in BMD were seen at the lumbar spine and hip in both arms of the trial. At Week 144, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving tenofovir DF + lamivudine + efavirenz compared with subjects receiving stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz. Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups. In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24–48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through 144 weeks. Twenty-eight percent of tenofovir DF-treated subjects vs. 21% of the comparator subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the tenofovir DF group and 6 subjects in the comparator group. Tenofovir DF was associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C-telopeptide, and urinary N-telopeptide), suggesting increased bone turnover. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. In a clinical trial of HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older (Study 321), bone effects were similar to adult subjects. Under normal circumstances BMD increases rapidly in this age group. In this trial, the mean rate of bone gain was less in the tenofovir DF-treated group compared to the placebo group. Six tenofovir DF-treated subjects and one placebo-treated subject had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at 48 weeks. Among 28 subjects receiving 96 weeks of tenofovir DF, Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. Skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. Markers of bone turnover in tenofovir DF-treated pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older suggest increased bone turnover, consistent with the effects observed in adults. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. For additional information, consult the VIREAD prescribing information. Cases of osteomalacia (associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and which may contribute to fractures) have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Convulsions have been observed in patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of known medical history of seizures. Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medications primarily metabolized by the liver, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels [See Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including the components of ATRIPLA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction trials have been conducted using TRUVADA tablets. Drug interaction trials have been conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the components of TRUVADA. This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions observed with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Didanosine: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations. Use with caution and monitor for evidence of didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis, neuropathy) when coadministered. Consider dose reductions or discontinuations of didanosine if warranted. (7.1) Atazanavir: Coadministration decreases atazanavir concentrations and increases tenofovir concentrations. Use atazanavir with TRUVADA only with ritonavir; monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.2) Lopinavir/ritonavir: Coadministration increases tenofovir concentrations. Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.3) 7.1 Didanosine Coadministration of TRUVADA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered with didanosine the Cmax and AUC of didanosine administered as either the buffered or enteric-coated formulation increased significantly [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis, and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg when it is coadministered with TRUVADA. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for adult or pediatric patients weighing less than 60 kg. When coadministered, TRUVADA and Videx EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (less than 400 kcal, 20% fat). Coadministration of didanosine buffered tablet formulation with TRUVADA should be under fasted conditions. 7.2 Atazanavir Atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving atazanavir and TRUVADA should be monitored for TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir decreases the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When coadministered with TRUVADA, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Atazanavir without ritonavir should not be coadministered with TRUVADA. 7.3 Lopinavir/Ritonavir Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir and TRUVADA should be monitored for TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No drug-drug interactions due to competition for renal excretion have been observed; however, coadministration of TRUVADA with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or the coadministered drug. Some examples include, but are not limited to acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, and valganciclovir. Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine and/or tenofovir."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe Acute Exacerbations of hepatitis B [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Decreases in Bone Mineral Density [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. In HIV1 infected patients, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) are diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. (6.1) In HIV-1 uninfected individuals in PrEP trials, adverse reactions that were reported by more than 2% of TRUVADA subjects and more frequently than by placebo subjects were headache, abdominal pain and weight decreased. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-445-3235 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in HIV-1 Infected Subjects Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934, an active-controlled clinical trial of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. See also Table 2 for the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse reactions (Grade 2–4) occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects treated in any treatment group in this trial. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles, was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Study 934 - Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions: In Study 934, 511 antiretroviral-naive subjects received either VIREAD + EMTRIVA administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254) for 144 weeks. Subjects had a mean age of 40 years (range 20 to 73 years) and were predominantly male (88%). Overall, 65% were White, 17% were Black, and 13% were Hispanic. Adverse reactions observed in this trial were generally consistent with those seen in other trials in treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving VIREAD and/or EMTRIVA (Table 2). Table 2 Selected Treatment-Emergent Adverse ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug.

In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above for Study 934, Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (>2.5 × ULN), increased pancreatic amylase (>2.0 × ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (<40 or >250 mg/dL), and increased serum lipase (>2.0 × ULN) occurred in up to 3% of subjects treated with EMTRIVA or VIREAD with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older Emtricitabine: In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with EMTRIVA in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, please consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a pediatric clinical trial conducted in subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with VIREAD were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of VIREAD in adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 6.2 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trial Experience in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Subjects No new adverse reactions to TRUVADA were identified from two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (iPrEx, Partners PrEP) in which 2830 HIV-1 uninfected adults received TRUVADA once daily for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Subjects were followed for a median of 71 weeks and 87 weeks, respectively. These trials enrolled HIV-negative individuals ranging in age from 18 to 67 years. The iPrEx trial enrolled only males or transgender females of Hispanic/Latino (72%), White (18%), Black (9%) and Asian (5%) race. The Partners PrEP trial enrolled both males (61–64% across treatment groups) and females in Kenya and Uganda. Table 4 provides a list of all adverse events that occurred ≥2% of subjects in any treatment group in the iPrEx and Partners PrEP trials. Laboratory Abnormalities: Table 5 provides a list of laboratory abnormalities observed in both trials. Six subjects in the TDF-containing arms of the Partners PrEP trial discontinued participation in the study due to an increase in blood creatinine compared with no discontinuations in the placebo group. One subject in the TRUVADA arm of the iPrEx trial discontinued from the study due to an increase in blood creatinine and another due to low phosphorous. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above, Grade 1 proteinuria (1+) occurred in 6% of subjects receiving TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial. Grade 2–3 proteinuria (2–4+) and glycosuria (3+) occurred in less than 1% of subjects treated with TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial and Partners PrEP trial.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CrCl) before initiating treatment with TRUVADA. Monitor CrCl and serum phosphorus in patients at risk. Avoid administering Truvada with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Coadministration with Other Products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.5) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.7) Triple nucleoside-only regimens: Early virologic failure has been reported in HIV-infected patients. Monitor carefully and consider treatment modification. (5.8) Comprehensive management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1: Use as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy including other prevention measures; strictly adhere to dosing schedule. (5.9) Management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 drug resistance: Prior to initiating TRUVADA for PrEP - if clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm negative HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. While using TRUVADA for PrEP - HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. (5.9) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including VIREAD, a component of TRUVADA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient or uninfected individual with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in HIV-1 infected patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with TRUVADA should be suspended in any patient or uninfected individual who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 HBV Infection It is recommended that all individuals be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating TRUVADA. TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients infected with HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are infected with HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with TRUVADA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. HBV -uninfected individuals should be offered vaccination. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. It is recommended that creatinine clearance be calculated in all individuals prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with TRUVADA. Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in all individuals at risk for renal impairment, including individuals who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA. TRUVADA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. Treatment of HIV-1 Infection Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min, [See Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received TRUVADA using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of TRUVADA therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. TRUVADA should not be administered to patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis TRUVADA for a PrEP indication should not be used if creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in creatinine clearance is observed in uninfected individuals while using TRUVADA for PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use [See Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.4 Coadministration with Other Products TRUVADA is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Do not coadminister TRUVADA with ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, or VIREAD. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, do not coadminister TRUVADA with other drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister TRUVADA with HEPSERA® (adefovir dipivoxil). 5.5 Decreases in Bone Mineral Density Assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) should be considered for adults and in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a 144-week trial of treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects, decreases in BMD were seen at the lumbar spine and hip in both arms of the trial. At Week 144, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving VIREAD + lamivudine + efavirenz compared with subjects receiving stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz. Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups. In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24–48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through 144 weeks. Twenty-eight percent of VIREAD-treated subjects vs. 21% of the comparator subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the VIREAD group and 6 subjects in the comparator group. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C-telopeptide, and urinary N-telopeptide), suggesting increased bone turnover. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving VIREAD. In a clinical trial of HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older (Study 321), bone effects were similar to adult subjects. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in this age group. In this trial, the mean rate of bone gain was less in the VIREAD-treated group compared to the placebo group. Six VIREAD treated subjects and one placebo treated subject had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss in 48 weeks. Among 28 subjects receiving 96 weeks of VIREAD, Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. Skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. Markers of bone turnover in VIREAD-treated pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older suggest increased bone turnover, consistent with the effects observed in adults. In clinical trials of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, decreases in BMD were observed. In the iPrEx trial, a substudy of 503 subjects found mean changes from baseline in BMD ranging from -0.4% to -1.0% across total hip, spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in the TRUVADA group compared with the placebo group, which returned toward baseline after discontinuation of treatment. Thirteen percent of subjects receiving TRUVADA vs. 6% of subjects receiving placebo lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine during treatment. Bone fractures were reported in 1.7% of the TRUVADA group compared with 1.4% in the placebo group. No correlation between BMD and fractures was noted [See Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The Partners PrEP trial found similar fracture rates between treatment and placebo groups (0.8% and 0.6%, respectively). No BMD evaluations were conducted during this trial [See Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The effects of VIREAD-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. For additional information, please consult the VIREAD prescribing information. Cases of osteomalacia (associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and which may contribute to fractures) have been reported in association with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in HIV-1 infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TRUVADA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Early Virologic Failure Clinical trials in HIV-1 infected subjects have demonstrated that certain regimens that only contain three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are generally less effective than triple drug regimens containing two NRTIs in combination with either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. In particular, early virological failure and high rates of resistance substitutions have been reported. Triple nucleoside regimens should therefore be used with caution. Patients on a therapy utilizing a triple nucleoside-only regimen should be carefully monitored and considered for treatment modification. 5.9 Comprehensive Management to Reduce the Risk of Acquiring HIV-1 Use TRUVADA for pre-exposure prophylaxis only as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes other prevention measures, such as safer sex practices, because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1 [See Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3)]. Counsel uninfected individuals about safer sex practices that include consistent and correct use of condoms, knowledge of their HIV-1 status and that of their partner(s), and regular testing for other sexually transmitted infections that can facilitate HIV-1 transmission (such as syphilis and gonorrhea). Inform uninfected individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior. Use TRUVADA to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 only in individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only TRUVADA, because TRUVADA alone does not constitute a complete treatment regimen for HIV-1 treatment [See Microbiology: Resistance (12.4)]; therefore, care should be taken to minimize drug exposure in HIV-infected individuals. Many HIV-1 tests, such as rapid tests, detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, evaluate seronegative individuals for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute viral infections (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash, etc.) and ask about potential exposure events (e.g., unprotected, or condom broke during sex with an HIV-1 infected partner) that may have occurred within the last month. If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. While using TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. If symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, PrEP should be discontinued until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. Counsel uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the recommended TRUVADA dosing schedule. The effectiveness of TRUVADA in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials [See Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See also Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). STRIBILD is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, STRIBILD should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. (5.4, 7.1) STRIBILD can alter the concentration of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A can alter the concentrations of one or more components of STRIBILD. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug-drug interactions. (4, 7.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Other Antiretroviral Medications STRIBILD is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, STRIBILD should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Complete information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided. 7.2 Potential for STRIBILD to Affect Other Drugs Cobicistat, a component of STRIBILD, is an inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of the following transporters: p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Thus, coadministration of STRIBILD with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6, or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs. Elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9 and may decrease the plasma concentrations of CYP2C9 substrates. 7.3 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect One or More Components of STRIBILD Elvitegravir and cobicistat, components of STRIBILD, are metabolized by CYP3A. Cobicistat is also metabolized, to a minor extent, by CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity are expected to increase the clearance of elvitegravir and cobicistat, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of cobicistat and elvitegravir, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and development of resistance (see Table 6). Coadministration of STRIBILD with other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance and increase the plasma concentration of cobicistat (see Table 6). 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of STRIBILD are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of STRIBILD with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include, but are not limited to acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g. gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.5 Established and Other Potentially Significant Interactions Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either STRIBILD, the components of STRIBILD, (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF) as individual agents and/or in combination, or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with STRIBILD [for magnitude of interaction, see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The table includes potentially significant interactions but is not all inclusive. Table 6 Established and Other Potentially SignificantThis table is not all inclusive. Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration ↑ = Increase, ↓ = Decrease, ⇔ = No Effect Clinical Comment Acid Reducing Agents: AntacidsIndicates that a drug-drug interaction trial was conducted. (for example aluminum and magnesium hydroxide) ↓ elvitegravir Elvitegravir plasma concentrations are lower when STRIBILD is administered simultaneously with antacids. It is recommended to separate STRIBILD and antacid administration by at least 2 hours. Antiarrhythmics: e.g. amiodarone bepridil digoxin disopyramide flecainide systemic lidocaine mexiletine propafenone quinidine ↑ antiarrhythmics ↑ digoxin Concentrations of these antiarrhythmic drugs may be increased when coadministered with STRIBILD. Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring, if available, is recommended for antiarrhythmics when coadministered with STRIBILD. Antibacterials: clarithromycin telithromycin ↑ clarithromycin ↑ telithromycin ↑ cobicistat Concentrations of clarithromycin and/or cobicistat may be altered when clarithromycin is coadministered with STRIBILD. Patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min: No dose adjustment of clarithromycin is required. Patients with CLcr between 50 mL/min and 60 mL/min: The dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%. Concentrations of telithromycin and/or cobicistat may be increased when telithromycin is coadministered with STRIBILD. Anticoagulants: warfarin Effect on warfarin unknown Concentrations of warfarin may be affected upon coadministration with STRIBILD. It is recommended that the international normalized ratio (INR) be monitored upon coadministration with STRIBILD. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine oxcarbazepine phenobarbital phenytoin ↑ carbamazepine ↓ elvitegravir ↓ cobicistat Coadministration of carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin with STRIBILD may significantly decrease cobicistat and elvitegravir plasma concentrations, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Alternative anticonvulsants should be considered. clonazepam ethosuximide ↑ clonazepam ↑ ethosuximide Concentrations of clonazepam and ethosuximide may be increased when coadministered with STRIBILD. Clinical monitoring is recommended upon coadministration with STRIBILD. Antidepressants: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) e.g. paroxetine Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) e.g. amitriptyline desipramine imipramine nortriptyline buproprion trazodone ↑ SSRIs ↑ TCAs ↑ trazodone Concentrations of these antidepressant agents may be increased when coadministered with STRIBILD. Careful dose titration of the antidepressant and monitoring for antidepressant response are recommended. Antifungals: itraconazole ketoconazole voriconazole ↑ elvitegravir ↑ cobicistat ↑ itraconazole ↑ ketoconazole ↑voriconazole Concentrations of ketoconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole may increase upon coadministration with STRIBILD. When administering with STRIBILD, the maximum daily dose of ketoconazole or itraconazole should not exceed 200 mg per day. An assessment of benefit/risk ratio is recommended to justify use of voriconazole with STRIBILD. Anti-gout: colchicine ↑ colchicine STRIBILD is not recommended to be coadministered with colchicine to patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Treatment of gout-flares – coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving STRIBILD: 0.6 mg (1 tablet) × 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Treatment course to be repeated no earlier than 3 days. Prophylaxis of gout-flares – coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving STRIBILD: If the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day. If the original regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day. Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever – coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving STRIBILD: Maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day). Antimycobacterial: rifabutin rifapentine ↓ elvitegravir ↓ cobicistat Coadministration of rifabutin and rifapentine with STRIBILD may significantly decrease elvitegravir and cobicistat plasma concentrations, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Coadministration of STRIBILD with rifabutin or rifapentine is not recommended. Beta-Blockers: e.g. metoprolol timolol ↑ beta-blockers Concentrations of beta-blockers may be increased when coadministered with STRIBILD. Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose decrease of the beta blocker may be necessary when these agents are coadministered with STRIBILD. Calcium Channel Blockers: e.g. amlodipine diltiazem felodipine nicardipine nifedipine verapamil ↑ calcium channel blockers Concentrations of calcium channel blockers may be increased when coadministered with STRIBILD. Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended upon coadministration with STRIBILD. Corticosteroid: Systemic: dexamethasone ↓ elvitegravir ↓ cobicistat Systemic dexamethasone, a CYP3A inducer, may significantly decrease elvitegravir and cobicistat plasma concentrations, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance. Corticosteroid: Inhaled/Nasal: fluticasone ↑ fluticasone Concomitant use of inhaled or nasal fluticasone and STRIBILD may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone, resulting in reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Alternative corticosteroids should be considered, particularly for long term use. Endothelin Receptor Antagonists: bosentan ↑ bosentan Coadministration of bosentan in patients on STRIBILD: In patients who have been receiving STRIBILD for at least 10 days, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability. Coadministration of STRIBILD in patients on bosentan: Discontinue use of bosentan at least 36 hours prior to initiation of STRIBILD. After at least 10 days following the initiation of STRIBILD, resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: atorvastatin ↑ atorvastatin Initiate with the lowest starting dose of atorvastatin and titrate carefully while monitoring for safety. Hormonal Contraceptives: norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol ↑ norgestimate ↓ ethinyl estradiol The effects of increases in the concentration of the progestational component norgestimate are not fully known and can include increased risk of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne, and venous thrombosis. The potential risks and benefits associated with coadministration of norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol with STRIBILD should be considered, particularly in women who have risk factors for these events. Coadministration of STRIBILD with other hormonal contraceptives (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive vaginal ring, or injectable contraceptives) or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied; therefore, alternative (non-hormonal) methods of contraception can be considered. Immuno-suppressants: e.g. cyclosporine sirolimus tacrolimus ↑ immuno-suppressants Concentrations of these immunosuppressant agents may be increased when coadministered with STRIBILD. Therapeutic monitoring of the immunosuppressive agents is recommended upon coadministration with STRIBILD. Narcotic Analgesics: buprenorphine/ naloxone ↑ buprenorphine ↑ norbuprenorphine ↓ naloxone Concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are increased when coadministered with STRIBILD. No dose adjustment of buprenorphine/naloxone is required upon coadministration with STRIBILD. Patients should be closely monitored for sedation and cognitive effects. Inhaled Beta Agonist: salmeterol ↑ salmeterol Coadministration of salmeterol and STRIBILD is not recommended. Coadministration of salmeterol with STRIBILD may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations, and sinus tachycardia. Neuroleptics: e.g. perphenazine risperidone thioridazine ↑ neuroleptics A decrease in dose of the neuroleptic may be needed when coadministered with STRIBILD. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) Inhibitors: sildenafil tadalafil vardenafil ↑ PDE5 inhibitors Coadministration with STRIBILD may result in an increase in PDE-5 inhibitor associated adverse reactions, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances, and priapism. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): Use of sildenafil is contraindicated when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The following dose adjustments are recommended for the use of tadalafil with STRIBILD: Coadministration of tadalafil in patients on STRIBILD: In patients receiving STRIBILD for at least 1 week, start tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase tadalafil dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Coadministration of STRIBILD in patients on tadalafil: Avoid use of tadalafil during the initiation of STRIBILD. Stop tadalafil at least 24 hours prior to starting STRIBILD. After at least one week following initiation of STRIBILD, resume tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase tadalafil dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction: Sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg in 72 hours, or tadalafil at a single dose not exceeding 10 mg in 72 hours can be used with increased monitoring for PDE-5 inhibitor associated with adverse events. Sedative/hypnotics: Benzodiazepines: e.g. Parenterally administered midazolam clorazepate diazepam estazolam flurazepam buspirone zolpidem ↑ sedatives/hypnotics Concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with STRIBILD may increase plasma concentrations of midazolam. Coadministration should be done in a setting that ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. Coadministration of oral midazolam with STRIBILD is contraindicated. With other sedative/hypnotics, dose reduction may be necessary and clinical monitoring is recommended. 7.6 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with STRIBILD Based on drug interaction studies conducted with the components of STRIBILD, no clinically significant drug interactions have been either observed or are expected when STRIBILD is combined with the following drugs: entecavir, famciclovir, H2 receptor antagonists, methadone, proton pump inhibitors and ribavirin."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse drug reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Most common adverse drug reactions to STRIBILD (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) are nausea and diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety assessment of STRIBILD is based on the Week 96 pooled data from 1408 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials, Study 102 and Study 103, in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult subjects [see Clinical Studies (14)]. A total of 701 subjects received STRIBILD once daily for at least 96 weeks. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with STRIBILD (elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg); ATRIPLA (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg); or atazanavir (ATV) + ritonavir (RTV) + TRUVADA (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg) due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 4.6%, 6.8% and 5.9%, respectively. Table 2 displays the frequency of adverse drug reactions greater than or equal to 5% of subjects in any treatment arm. Table 2 Adverse Drug ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events, attributed to study drugs.

Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials of the Components of STRIBILD Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In addition to the adverse reactions observed with STRIBILD, the following adverse reactions occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naïve subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: depression, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, fever, pain, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), anxiety, increased cough, and rhinitis. Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Laboratory Abnormalities The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3–4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving STRIBILD in Studies 102 and 103 are presented in Table 3. Table 3 Laboratory Abnormalities (Grades 3–4) Reported in ≥ 2% of Subjects Receiving STRIBILD in Studies 102 and 103 (Week 96 analysis) STRIBILD ATRIPLA ATV + RTV + TRUVADA Laboratory Parameter Abnormality Frequencies are based on treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. , For subjects with serum amylase > 1.5 × upper limit of normal, lipase test was also performed. The frequency of increased lipase (Grades 3–4) occurring in STRIBILD (N=61), ATRIPLA (N=36), and ATV +RTV + TRUVADA (N=36) was 15%, 17%, and 25%, respectively. N=701 N=352 N=355 AST (>5.0 × ULN) 2% 6% 6% Amylase (>2.0 × ULN) 3% 2% 4% Creatine Kinase (≥ 10.0 × ULN) 7% 14% 10% Urine RBC (Hematuria) (> 75 RBC/HPF) 3% 2% 4% In Study 103, BMD was assessed by DEXA in a non-random subset of 120 subjects. Mean percentage decreases in BMD from baseline to Week 96 in the STRIBILD group (N = 47) were comparable to the ATV + RTV + TRUVADA group (N = 53) at the lumbar spine (-2.0% versus -3.5%, respectively) and at the hip (-3.2% versus -4.2%, respectively). In Studies 102 and 103, bone fractures occurred in 14 subjects (2.0%) in the STRIBILD group, 8 subjects (2.3%) in the ATRIPLA group, and 14 subjects (3.9%) in the ATV + RTV + TRUVADA group. These findings were consistent with data from an earlier 144-week trial of treatment-naïve subjects receiving tenofovir DF + lamivudine + efavirenz. Proteinuria (all grades) occurred in 46% of subjects receiving STRIBILD, 38% of subjects receiving ATRIPLA, and 37% of subjects receiving ATV + RTV + TRUVADA. The cobicistat component of STRIBILD has been shown to increase serum creatinine and decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function. In Studies 102 and 103, increases in serum creatinine and decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment with STRIBILD, after which they stabilized. Table 4 displays the mean changes in serum creatinine and eGFR levels at Week 96 and the percentage of subjects with elevations in serum creatinine (All Grades). Table 4 Change from Baseline in Serum Creatinine and eGFR and Incidence of Elevated Serum Creatinine (All Grades) at Week 96 STRIBILD (N=701) ATRIPLA (N=352) ATV + RTV + TRUVADA (N=355) Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)Mean change ±SD 0.13 (±0.13) 0.01 (±0.13) 0.08 (±0.14) eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault (mL/min) -13.2 (±15.7) -0.9 (±16.1) -8.6 (±17.8) Subjects with Elevations in Serum Creatinine (All Grades)(%) 10 1 5 Emtricitabine or Tenofovir DF: In addition to the laboratory abnormalities observed with STRIBILD, the following laboratory abnormalities have been previously reported in subjects treated with emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities of ALT (M: greater than 215 U per L; F: greater than 170 U per L), alkaline phosphatase (greater than 550 U per L), bilirubin (greater than 2.5 × ULN), serum glucose (less than 40 or greater than 250 mg per dL), glycosuria (greater than or equal to 3+), neutrophils (less than 750 per mm3), fasting cholesterol (greater than 240 mg per dL), and fasting triglycerides (greater than 750 mg per dL). Serum Lipids: In the clinical trials of STRIBILD, a similar percentage of subjects receiving STRIBILD, ATRIPLA, and ATV + RTV + TRUVADA were on lipid lowering agents at baseline (11%, 11%, and 12%, respectively). While receiving study drug through Week 96, an additional 8% of STRIBILD subjects were started on lipid lowering agents, compared to 9% of ATRIPLA and 8% of ATV + RTV + TRUVADA subjects. Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides are presented in Table 5.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tenofovir DF. No additional postmarketing adverse reactions specific for emtricitabine have been identified. Immune System Disorders allergic reaction, including angioedema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders pancreatitis, increased amylase, abdominal pain Hepatobiliary Disorders hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes (most commonly AST, ALT gamma GT) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders rash Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and which may contribute to fractures), muscular weakness, myopathy Renal and Urinary Disorders acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, interstitial nephritis (including acute cases), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal insufficiency, increased creatinine, proteinuria, polyuria General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions asthenia The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, hypophosphatemia."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CLcr), urine glucose and urine protein before initiating treatment with STRIBILD. Monitor CLcr, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients at risk for renal impairment. Avoid administering STRIBILD with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Avoid coadministration with other anti-retroviral products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, or VIREAD; with drugs containing lamivudine; or with drugs or regimens containing ritonavir. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.5) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.7) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with STRIBILD should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy. STRIBILD is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of STRIBILD have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of STRIBILD. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with STRIBILD. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, and with the use of STRIBILD [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In the clinical trials of STRIBILD over 96 weeks, 10 (1.4%) subjects in the STRIBILD group (N=701) and 2 (0.3%) subjects in the combined comparator groups (N = 707) discontinued study drug due to a renal adverse reaction. Of these discontinuations, 8 in the STRIBILD group and 1 in the combined comparator groups occurred during the first 48 week. Four (0.6%) of the subjects who received STRIBILD developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction leading to discontinuation of STRIBILD compared to none in the comparator groups. Two of these four subjects had renal impairment (i.e. estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 mL per minute) at baseline. The laboratory findings in these 4 subjects with evidence of proximal tubulopathy improved but did not completely resolve in all subjects upon discontinuation of STRIBILD. Renal replacement therapy was not required for these subjects. Estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein should be documented in all patients prior to initiating therapy. Initiation of STRIBILD in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute is not recommended. STRIBILD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients. Routine monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein should be performed during STRIBILD therapy in all patients. Additionally, serum phosphorus should be measured in patients at risk for renal impairment. Although cobicistat (a component of STRIBILD) may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. The emtricitabine and tenofovir DF components of STRIBILD are primarily excreted by the kidney. STRIBILD should be discontinued if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL per minute as dose interval adjustment required for emtricitabine and tenofovir DF cannot be achieved with the fixed-dose combination tablet. 5.4 Avoid Use with Other Antiretroviral Products STRIBILD is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and coadministration with other antiretroviral products is not recommended. STRIBILD is not recommended for coadministration with the following: emtricitabine or tenofovir DF (ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, VIREAD); products containing lamivudine (COMBIVIR, EPIVIR, EPIVIR-HBV, EPZICOM, TRIZIVIR) or adefovir dipivoxil (HEPSERA); ritonavir (NORVIR, KALETRA). 5.5 Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF Bone Mineral Density: In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, tenofovir DF (a component of STRIBILD) was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1.25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. For additional information, see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and consult the VIREAD prescribing information. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for HIV-1 infected patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial in all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects: Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including STRIBILD. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions with ATRIPLA. Drug interaction trials are described elsewhere in the labeling [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Efavirenz: Coadministration of efavirenz can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of efavirenz. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered before and during therapy. (4.2, 7.1, 12.3) Didanosine: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations. Use with caution and monitor for evidence of didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis, neuropathy) when coadministered. Consider dose reductions or discontinuations of didanosine if warranted. (7.2) Atazanavir: Coadministration of ATRIPLA and atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir is not recommended. (7.3) Lopinavir/ritonavir: Coadministration increases tenofovir concentrations. Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.3) 7.1 Efavirenz Efavirenz has been shown in vivo to induce CYP3A and CYP2B6. Other compounds that are substrates of CYP3A or CYP2B6 may have decreased plasma concentrations when coadministered with efavirenz. In vitro studies have demonstrated that efavirenz inhibits CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 isozymes in the range of observed efavirenz plasma concentrations. Coadministration of efavirenz with drugs primarily metabolized by these isozymes may result in altered plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug. Therefore, appropriate dose adjustments may be necessary for these drugs. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity (e.g., phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin) would be expected to increase the clearance of efavirenz resulting in lowered plasma concentrations [See Dosage and Administration (2)]. 7.2 Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of ATRIPLA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, and valganciclovir. Coadministration of tenofovir DF and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions [for didanosine dosing adjustment recommendations, see Table 4 ]. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir with ATRIPLA should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions [See Table 4]. Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended since coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF has been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of atazanavir. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA [See Table 4]. 7.3 Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Other important drug interaction information for ATRIPLA is summarized in Table 1 and Table 4. The drug interactions described are based on trials conducted with efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir DF as individual agents or are potential drug interactions; no drug interaction trials have been conducted using ATRIPLA [for pharmacokinetics data see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Tables 5–9]. The tables include potentially significant interactions, but are not all inclusive. Table 4 Established and Other Potentially SignificantThis table is not all inclusive. Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Trials or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect Clinical Comment HIV antiviral agents Protease inhibitor: atazanavir ↓atazanavir ↑ tenofovir Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF decreases plasma concentrations of atazanavir. The combined effect of efavirenz plus tenofovir DF on atazanavir plasma concentrations is not known. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA. Protease inhibitor: fosamprenavir calcium ↓ amprenavir Fosamprenavir (unboosted): Appropriate doses of fosamprenavir and ATRIPLA with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir: An additional 100 mg/day (300 mg total) of ritonavir is recommended when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily. No change in the ritonavir dose is required when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir plus ritonavir twice daily. Protease inhibitor: indinavir ↓ indinavir The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz, is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. Protease inhibitor: lopinavir/ritonavir ↓ lopinavir ↑ tenofovir Do not use once daily administration of lopinavir/ritonavir. Dose adjustment of lopinavir/ritonavir is recommended when coadministered with efavirenz. Refer to the full prescribing information for lopinavir/ritonavir for guidance on coadministration with efavirenz- or tenofovir-containing regimens, such as ATRIPLA. Patients should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Protease inhibitor: ritonavir ↑ ritonavir ↑ efavirenz When ritonavir 500 mg every 12 hours was coadministered with efavirenz 600 mg once daily, the combination was associated with a higher frequency of adverse clinical experiences (e.g., dizziness, nausea, paresthesia) and laboratory abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes). Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when ATRIPLA is used in combination with ritonavir. Protease inhibitor: saquinavir ↓ saquinavir Appropriate doses of the combination of efavirenz and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. CCR5 co-receptor antagonist: maraviroc ↓ maraviroc Efavirenz decreases plasma concentrations of maraviroc. Refer to the full prescribing information for maraviroc for guidance on coadministration with ATRIPLA. NRTI: didanosine ↑ didanosine Coadministration of ATRIPLA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions including pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, and neuropathy. A dose reduction of didanosine is recommended when co-administered with tenofovir DF. For additional information on coadministration with tenofovir DF-containing products, please refer to the didanosine prescribing information. NNRTI: Other NNRTIs ↑ or ↓ efavirenz and/or NNRTI Combining two NNRTIs has not been shown to be beneficial. ATRIPLA contains efavirenz and should not be coadministered with other NNRTIs. Integrase strand transfer inhibitor: raltegravir ↓ raltegravir Efavirenz reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir. The clinical significance of this interaction has not been directly assessed. Hepatitis C antiviral agents Protease inhibitor: boceprevir ↓ boceprevir Plasma trough concentrations of boceprevir were decreased when boceprevir was coadministered with efavirenz, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect. The combination should be avoided. Protease inhibitor: telaprevir ↓ telaprevir ↓ efavirenz Concomitant administration of telaprevir and efavirenz resulted in reduced steady-state exposures to telaprevir and efavirenz. Other agents Anticoagulant: warfarin ↑ or ↓ warfarin Plasma concentrations and effects potentially increased or decreased by efavirenz. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine ↓ carbamazepine ↓ efavirenz There are insufficient data to make a dose recommendation for ATRIPLA. Alternative anticonvulsant treatment should be used. phenytoin phenobarbital ↓ anticonvulsant ↓ efavirenz Potential for reduction in anticonvulsant and/or efavirenz plasma levels; periodic monitoring of anticonvulsant plasma levels should be conducted. Antidepressants: bupropion ↓ buproprion The effect of efavirenz on bupropion exposure is thought to be due to the induction of bupropion metabolism. Increases in bupropion dosage should be guided by clinical response, but the maximum recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded. sertraline ↓ sertraline Increases in sertraline dose should be guided by clinical response. Antifungals: itraconazole ↓ itraconazole ↓ hydroxy-itraconazole Since no dose recommendation for itraconazole can be made, alternative antifungal treatment should be considered. ketoconazole ↓ ketoconazole Drug interaction trials with ATRIPLA and ketoconazole have not been conducted. Efavirenz has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of ketoconazole. posaconazole ↓ posaconazole Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit outweighs the risks. Anti-infective: clarithromycin ↓ clarithromycin ↑ 14-OH metabolite Clinical significance unknown. In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving efavirenz and clarithromycin. No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is recommended when given with clarithromycin. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Other macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, have not been studied in combination with ATRIPLA. Antimycobacterial: rifabutin ↓ rifabutin concentration Increase daily dose of rifabutin by 50%. Consider doubling the rifabutin dose in regimens where rifabutin is given 2 or 3 times a week. rifampin ↓ efavirenz If ATRIPLA is coadministered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an additional 200 mg/day of efavirenz is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: diltiazem ↓ diltiazem ↓ desacetyl diltiazem ↓ N-monodes-methyl diltiazem Diltiazem dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for diltiazem). No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is necessary when administered with diltiazem. Others (e.g., felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) ↓ calcium channel blocker No data are available on the potential interactions of efavirenz with other calcium channel blockers that are substrates of CYP3A. The potential exists for reduction in plasma concentrations of the calcium channel blocker. Dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for the calcium channel blocker). HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: atorvastatin pravastatin simvastatin ↓ atorvastatin ↓ pravastatin ↓ simvastatin Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin decreased with efavirenz. Consult the full prescribing information for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for guidance on individualizing the dose. Hormonal contraceptives: Oral: ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate ↓ active metabolites of norgestimate A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. Efavirenz had no effect on ethinyl estradiol concentrations, but progestin levels (norelgestromin and levonorgestrel) were markedly decreased. No effect of ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate on efavirenz plasma concentrations was observed. Implant: etonogestrel ↓ etonogestrel A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. The interaction between etonogestrel and efavirenz has not been studied. Decreased exposure of etonogestrel may be expected. There have been postmarketing reports of contraceptive failure with etonogestrel in efavirenz-exposed patients. Immunosuppressants: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and others metabolized by CYP3A ↓ immuno-suppressant Decreased exposure of the immunosuppressant may be expected due to CYP3A induction by efavirenz. These immunosuppressants are not anticipated to affect exposure of efavirenz. Dose adjustments of the immunosuppressant may be required. Close monitoring of immunosuppressant concentrations for at least 2 weeks (until stable concentrations are reached) is recommended when starting or stopping treatment with ATRIPLA. Narcotic analgesic: methadone ↓ methadone Coadministration of efavirenz in HIV-1 infected individuals with a history of injection drug use resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal. Methadone dose was increased by a mean of 22% to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be monitored for signs of withdrawal and their methadone dose increased as required to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. 7.4 Efavirenz Assay Interference Cannabinoid Test Interaction: Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have been observed in non-HIV-infected volunteers receiving efavirenz when the Microgenics Cedia DAU Multi-Level THC assay was used for screening. Negative results were obtained when more specific confirmatory testing was performed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. For more information, please consult the SUSTIVA prescribing information."

Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects Study 934 Study 934 was an open-label active-controlled trial in which 511 antiretroviral-naive subjects received either emtricitabine + tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254). The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934 include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. Adverse reactions observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials of the individual components (Table 2). Table 2 Selected Treatment-Emergent Adverse ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug. (Grades 2–4) Reported in ≥5% in Either Treatment Group in Study 934 (0–144 Weeks) FTC + TDF + EFVFrom Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine + tenofovir DF with efavirenz.

The adverse reactions observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those seen in Study 934 and those seen with the individual components of ATRIPLA when each was administered in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, or Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate In addition to the adverse reactions in Study 934 and Study 073 the following adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Efavirenz: The most significant adverse reactions observed in subjects treated with efavirenz are nervous system symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], psychiatric symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], and rash [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Selected adverse reactions of moderate-severe intensity observed in greater than or equal to 2% of efavirenz-treated subjects in two controlled clinical trials included pain, impaired concentration, abnormal dreams, somnolence, anorexia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nervousness, and pruritus. Pancreatitis has also been reported, although a causal relationship with efavirenz has not been established. Asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels were observed in a significantly higher number of subjects treated with efavirenz 600 mg than in control subjects. Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials include arthralgia, increased cough, dyspepsia, fever, myalgia, pain, abdominal pain, back pain, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), pneumonia, rhinitis and rash event (including rash, pruritus, maculopapular rash, urticaria, vesiculobullous rash, pustular rash and allergic reaction). Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects Efavirenz: In a pediatric clinical trial in 57 NRTI-experienced subjects aged 3 to 16 years, the type and frequency of adverse experiences was generally similar to that of adult subjects with the exception of a higher incidence of rash, which was reported in 46% (26/57) of pediatric subjects compared to 26% of adults, and a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 rash reported in 5% (3/57) of pediatric subjects compared to 0.9% of adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. For additional information, please consult the SUSTIVA prescribing information. Emtricitabine: In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with emtricitabine in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, please consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a pediatric clinical trial conducted in subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with tenofovir DF were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of tenofovir DF in adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. 6.2 Laboratory Abnormalities Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Laboratory abnormalities observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials (Table 3). Table 3 Significant Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in ≥1% of Subjects in Either Treatment Group in Study 934 (0–144 Weeks) FTC + TDF + EFVFrom Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine + tenofovir DF with efavirenz. AZT/3TC + EFV N=257 N=254 Any ≥ Grade 3 Laboratory Abnormality 30% 26% Fasting Cholesterol (>240 mg/dL) 22% 24% Creatine Kinase (M: >990 U/L) (F: >845 U/L) 9% 7% Serum Amylase (>175 U/L) 8% 4% Alkaline Phosphatase (>550 U/L) 1% 0% AST (M: >180 U/L) (F: >170 U/L) 3% 3% ALT (M: >215 U/L) (F: >170 U/L) 2% 3% Hemoglobin (<8.0 mg/dL) 0% 4% Hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL) 2% 1% Hematuria (>75 RBC/HPF) 3% 2% Glycosuria (≥3+) <1% 1% Neutrophils (<750/mm3) 3% 5% Fasting Triglycerides (>750 mg/dL) 4% 2% Laboratory abnormalities observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those in Study 934. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described for Study 934 (Table 3), Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (greater than 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)), increased pancreatic amylase (greater than 2.0 × ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (less than 40 or greater than 250 mg/dL), and increased serum lipase (greater than 2.0 × ULN) occurred in up to 3% of subjects treated with emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Hepatic Events: In Study 934, 19 subjects treated with efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF and 20 subjects treated with efavirenz and fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine were hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody positive. Among these coinfected subjects, one subject (1/19) in the efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF arm had elevations in transaminases to greater than five times ULN through 144 weeks. In the fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine arm, two subjects (2/20) had elevations in transaminases to greater than five times ULN through 144 weeks. No HBV and/or HCV coinfected subject discontinued from the trial due to hepatobiliary disorders [See Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Efavirenz: Cardiac Disorders Palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Tinnitus, vertigo Endocrine Disorders Gynecomastia Eye Disorders Abnormal vision Gastrointestinal Disorders Constipation, malabsorption General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Asthenia Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatic enzyme increase, hepatic failure, hepatitis. A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, were characterized by a fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death. Immune System Disorders Allergic reactions Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [See Warnings and Precautions (5.14)], hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia, myalgia, myopathy Nervous System Disorders Abnormal coordination, ataxia, cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, convulsions, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, neuropathy, tremor Psychiatric Disorders Aggressive reactions, agitation, delusions, emotional lability, mania, neurosis, paranoia, psychosis, suicide Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Flushing, erythema multiforme, photoallergic dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome Emtricitabine: No postmarketing adverse reactions have been identified for inclusion in this section. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Immune System Disorders Allergic reaction, including angioedema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders Pancreatitis, increased amylase, abdominal pain Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes (most commonly AST, ALT, gamma GT) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and which may contribute to fractures), muscular weakness, myopathy Renal and Urinary Disorders Acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, interstitial nephritis (including acute cases), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal insufficiency, increased creatinine, proteinuria, polyuria General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Asthenia The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, hypophosphatemia."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious psychiatric symptoms: Immediate medical evaluation is recommended. (5.5, 6.1) Nervous system symptoms (NSS): NSS are frequent, usually begin 1–2 days after initiating therapy and resolve in 2–4 weeks. Dosing at bedtime may improve tolerability. NSS are not predictive of onset of psychiatric symptoms. (2, 5.6) New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CrCl) before initiating treatment with ATRIPLA. Monitor CrCl and serum phosphorus in patients at risk. Avoid administering ATRIPLA with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.7) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. A pregnancy registry is available. (5.8, 8.1) Rash: Discontinue if severe rash develops. (5.9, 6.1) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment in patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C coinfection, marked transaminase elevations, or who are taking medications associated with liver toxicity. Among reported cases of hepatic failure, a few occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease. (5.10, 6.3, 8.6) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathological fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.11) Convulsions: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures. (5.12) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.13) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.14) Coadministration with other products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, STRIBILD, TRUVADA, or VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. SUSTIVA (efavirenz) should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless required for dose-adjustment when coadministered with rifampin. (5.4) Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.2) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs including tenofovir DF, a component of ATRIPLA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with ATRIPLA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic HBV before initiating antiretroviral therapy. ATRIPLA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, and the safety and efficacy of ATRIPLA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of ATRIPLA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with emtricitabine, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow up for at least several months after stopping treatment with ATRIPLA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. ATRIPLA should not be administered with HEPSERA® (adefovir dipivoxil) [See Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.3 Drug Interactions Efavirenz plasma concentrations may be altered by substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A. Likewise, efavirenz may alter plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2B6 [See Contraindications (4.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Coadministration with Related Products Related drugs not for coadministration with ATRIPLA include COMPLERA® (emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF), EMTRIVA® (emtricitabine), STRIBILD® (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF), TRUVADA® (emtricitabine/tenofovir DF), and VIREAD® (tenofovir DF), which contain the same active components as ATRIPLA. SUSTIVA® (efavirenz) should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless needed for dose-adjustment (e.g. with rifampin) [See Dosage and Administration (2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, ATRIPLA should not be coadministered with drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir, or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). 5.5 Psychiatric Symptoms Serious psychiatric adverse experiences have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. In controlled trials of 1008 subjects treated with regimens containing efavirenz for a mean of 2.1 years and 635 subjects treated with control regimens for a mean of 1.5 years, the frequency (regardless of causality) of specific serious psychiatric events among subjects who received efavirenz or control regimens, respectively, were: severe depression (2.4%, 0.9%), suicidal ideation (0.7%, 0.3%), nonfatal suicide attempts (0.5%, 0%), aggressive behavior (0.4%, 0.5%), paranoid reactions (0.4%, 0.3%), and manic reactions (0.2%, 0.3%). When psychiatric symptoms similar to those noted above were combined and evaluated as a group in a multifactorial analysis of data from Study AI266006 (006), treatment with efavirenz was associated with an increase in the occurrence of these selected psychiatric symptoms. Other factors associated with an increase in the occurrence of these psychiatric symptoms were history of injection drug use, psychiatric history, and receipt of psychiatric medication at trial entry; similar associations were observed in both the efavirenz and control treatment groups. In Study 006, onset of new serious psychiatric symptoms occurred throughout the trial for both efavirenz-treated and control-treated subjects. One percent of efavirenz-treated subjects discontinued or interrupted treatment because of one or more of these selected psychiatric symptoms. There have also been occasional postmarketing reports of death by suicide, delusions, and psychosis-like behavior, although a causal relationship to the use of efavirenz cannot be determined from these reports. Patients with serious psychiatric adverse experiences should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits [See Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.6 Nervous System Symptoms Fifty-three percent (531/1008) of subjects receiving efavirenz in controlled trials reported central nervous system symptoms (any grade, regardless of causality) compared to 25% (156/635) of subjects receiving control regimens. These symptoms included dizziness (28.1% of the 1008 subjects), insomnia (16.3%), impaired concentration (8.3%), somnolence (7.0%), abnormal dreams (6.2%), and hallucinations (1.2%). Other reported symptoms were euphoria, confusion, agitation, amnesia, stupor, abnormal thinking, and depersonalization. The majority of these symptoms were mild-moderate (50.7%); symptoms were severe in 2.0% of subjects. Overall, 2.1% of subjects discontinued therapy as a result. These symptoms usually begin during the first or second day of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2–4 weeks of therapy. After 4 weeks of therapy, the prevalence of nervous system symptoms of at least moderate severity ranged from 5% to 9% in subjects treated with regimens containing efavirenz and from 3% to 5% in subjects treated with a control regimen. Patients should be informed that these common symptoms were likely to improve with continued therapy and were not predictive of subsequent onset of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of these nervous system symptoms [See Dosage and Administration (2)]. Analysis of long-term data from Study 006, (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for subjects treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated subjects were generally similar to those in the indinavir-containing control arm. Patients receiving ATRIPLA should be alerted to the potential for additive central nervous system effects when ATRIPLA is used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms such as dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or drowsiness should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. 5.7 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney; however, efavirenz is not. Since ATRIPLA is a combination product and the dose of the individual components cannot be altered, patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min should not receive ATRIPLA. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. It is recommended that creatinine clearance be calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with ATRIPLA. Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in patients at risk for renal impairment, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA. ATRIPLA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. 5.8 Reproductive Risk Potential Pregnancy Category D: Efavirenz may cause fetal harm when administered during the first trimester to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving ATRIPLA. Barrier contraception must always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (e.g., oral or other hormonal contraceptives). Because of the long half-life of efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of ATRIPLA is recommended. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of ATRIPLA. If this drug is used during the first trimester of pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of ATRIPLA in pregnant women. ATRIPLA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus, such as in pregnant women without other therapeutic options [See Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Rash In controlled clinical trials, 26% (266/1008) of subjects treated with 600 mg efavirenz experienced new-onset skin rash compared with 17% (111/635) of subjects treated in control groups. Rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation, or ulceration occurred in 0.9% (9/1008) of subjects treated with efavirenz. The incidence of Grade 4 rash (e.g., erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in subjects treated with efavirenz in all trials and expanded access was 0.1%. Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 2 weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz (median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days) and, in most subjects continuing therapy with efavirenz, rash resolves within 1 month (median duration, 16 days). The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was 1.7% (17/1008). ATRIPLA can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement, or fever. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. For patients who have had a life-threatening cutaneous reaction (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), alternative therapy should be considered [See also Contraindications (4.1)]. Experience with efavirenz in subjects who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited. Nineteen subjects who discontinued nevirapine because of rash have been treated with efavirenz. Nine of these subjects developed mild-to-moderate rash while receiving therapy with efavirenz, and two of these subjects discontinued because of rash. Rash was reported in 26 of 57 pediatric subjects (46%) treated with efavirenz [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. One pediatric subject experienced Grade 3 rash (confluent rash with fever), and two subjects had Grade 4 rash (erythema multiforme). The median time to onset of rash in pediatric subjects was 8 days. Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines before initiating therapy with ATRIPLA in pediatric patients should be considered. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Monitoring of liver enzymes before and during treatment is recommended for patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C infection; patients with marked transaminase elevations; and patients treated with other medications associated with liver toxicity [See also Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Liver enzyme monitoring should also be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. In patients with persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued therapy with ATRIPLA needs to be weighed against the unknown risks of significant liver toxicity [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.11 Decreases in Bone Mineral Density Assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) should be considered for patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. In a 144-week trial of treatment-naive adult subjects receiving tenofovir DF, decreases in BMD were seen at the lumbar spine and hip in both arms of the trial. At Week 144, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving tenofovir DF + lamivudine + efavirenz compared with subjects receiving stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz. Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups. In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24–48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through 144 weeks. Twenty-eight percent of tenofovir DF-treated subjects vs. 21% of the comparator subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the tenofovir DF group and 6 subjects in the comparator group. Tenofovir DF was associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C-telopeptide, and urinary N-telopeptide), suggesting increased bone turnover. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. In a clinical trial of HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older (Study 321), bone effects were similar to adult subjects. Under normal circumstances BMD increases rapidly in this age group. In this trial, the mean rate of bone gain was less in the tenofovir DF-treated group compared to the placebo group. Six tenofovir DF-treated subjects and one placebo-treated subject had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at 48 weeks. Among 28 subjects receiving 96 weeks of tenofovir DF, Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. Skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. Markers of bone turnover in tenofovir DF-treated pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older suggest increased bone turnover, consistent with the effects observed in adults. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. For additional information, consult the VIREAD prescribing information. Cases of osteomalacia (associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and which may contribute to fractures) have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.12 Convulsions Convulsions have been observed in patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of known medical history of seizures. Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medications primarily metabolized by the liver, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels [See Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.13 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including the components of ATRIPLA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.14 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions with ATRIPLA. Drug interaction trials are described elsewhere in the labeling [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Efavirenz: Coadministration of efavirenz can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of efavirenz. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered before and during therapy. (4.2, 7.1, 12.3) Didanosine: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations. Use with caution and monitor for evidence of didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis, neuropathy) when coadministered. Consider dose reductions or discontinuations of didanosine if warranted. (7.2) HIV-1 protease inhibitors: Coadministration of ATRIPLA with either lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir and ritonavir increases tenofovir concentrations. Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. Coadministration of ATRIPLA with either atazanavir or atazanavir and ritonavir is not recommended. (7.3) 7.1 Efavirenz Efavirenz has been shown in vivo to induce CYP3A and CYP2B6. Other compounds that are substrates of CYP3A or CYP2B6 may have decreased plasma concentrations when coadministered with efavirenz. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity (e.g., phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin) would be expected to increase the clearance of efavirenz, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations [See Dosage and Administration (2)]. 7.2 Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of ATRIPLA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Coadministration of tenofovir DF and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions [for didanosine dosing adjustment recommendations, see Table 3]. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. Darunavir with ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir have been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. Tenofovir DF is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters. When tenofovir DF is coadministered with an inhibitor of these transporters, an increase in absorption may be observed. Patients receiving darunavir with ritonavir and ATRIPLA, or lopinavir/ritonavir with ATRIPLA, should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions [See Table 3]. Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended since coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF has been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of atazanavir. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA [See Table 3]. 7.3 Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Other important drug interaction information for ATRIPLA is summarized in Table 3. The drug interactions described are based on trials conducted with either ATRIPLA, the components of ATRIPLA (efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir DF) as individual agents, or are potential drug interactions [for pharmacokinetic data see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Tables 4–7]. The tables include potentially significant interactions, but are not all inclusive. Table 3 Established and Other Potentially SignificantThis table is not all inclusive. Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Trials or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect Clinical Comment HIV antiviral agents Protease inhibitor: atazanavir ↓atazanavir ↑ tenofovir Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF decreases plasma concentrations of atazanavir. The combined effect of efavirenz plus tenofovir DF on atazanavir plasma concentrations is not known. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA. Protease inhibitor: fosamprenavir calcium ↓ amprenavir Fosamprenavir (unboosted): Appropriate doses of fosamprenavir and ATRIPLA with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir: An additional 100 mg/day (300 mg total) of ritonavir is recommended when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily. No change in the ritonavir dose is required when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir plus ritonavir twice daily. Protease inhibitor: indinavir ↓ indinavir The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz, is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. Protease inhibitor: lopinavir/ritonavir ↓ lopinavir ↑ tenofovir Do not use once daily administration of lopinavir/ritonavir. Dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir is recommended for all patients when coadministered with efavirenz. Refer to the full prescribing information for lopinavir/ritonavir for guidance on coadministration with efavirenz- or tenofovir-containing regimens, such as ATRIPLA. Patients should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Protease inhibitor: ritonavir ↑ ritonavir ↑ efavirenz When ritonavir 500 mg every 12 hours was coadministered with efavirenz 600 mg once daily, the combination was associated with a higher frequency of adverse clinical experiences (e.g., dizziness, nausea, paresthesia) and laboratory abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes). Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when ATRIPLA is used in combination with ritonavir. Protease inhibitor: saquinavir ↓ saquinavir Appropriate doses of the combination of efavirenz and saquinavir/ritonavir with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. CCR5 co-receptor antagonist: maraviroc ↓ maraviroc Efavirenz decreases plasma concentrations of maraviroc. Refer to the full prescribing information for maraviroc for guidance on coadministration with ATRIPLA. NRTI: didanosine ↑ didanosine Coadministration of ATRIPLA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions including pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, and neuropathy. A dose reduction of didanosine is recommended when coadministered with tenofovir DF. For additional information on coadministration with tenofovir DF-containing products, please refer to the didanosine prescribing information. NNRTI: Other NNRTIs ↑ or ↓ efavirenz and/or NNRTI Combining two NNRTIs has not been shown to be beneficial. ATRIPLA contains efavirenz and should not be coadministered with other NNRTIs. Integrase strand transfer inhibitor: raltegravir ↓ raltegravir Efavirenz reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir. The clinical significance of this interaction has not been directly assessed. Hepatitis C antiviral agents Protease inhibitor: boceprevir ↓ boceprevir Plasma trough concentrations of boceprevir were decreased when boceprevir was coadministered with efavirenz, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect. The combination should be avoided. Protease inhibitor: simeprevir ↓ simeprevir ↔ efavirenz Concomitant administration of simeprevir with efavirenz is not recommended because it may result in loss of therapeutic effect of simeprevir. NS5A inhibitor/NS5B polymerase inhibitor : ledipasvir/sofosbuvir ↑ tenofovir Patients receiving ATRIPLA and HARVONI® (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) concomitantly should be monitored for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir DF. Other agents Anticoagulant: warfarin ↑ or ↓ warfarin Plasma concentrations and effects potentially increased or decreased by efavirenz. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine ↓ carbamazepine ↓ efavirenz There are insufficient data to make a dose recommendation for ATRIPLA. Alternative anticonvulsant treatment should be used. phenytoin phenobarbital ↓ anticonvulsant ↓ efavirenz Potential for reduction in anticonvulsant and/or efavirenz plasma levels; periodic monitoring of anticonvulsant plasma levels should be conducted. Antidepressants: bupropion ↓ buproprion The effect of efavirenz on bupropion exposure is thought to be due to the induction of bupropion metabolism. Increases in bupropion dosage should be guided by clinical response, but the maximum recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded. sertraline ↓ sertraline Increases in sertraline dose should be guided by clinical response. Antifungals: itraconazole ↓ itraconazole ↓ hydroxy-itraconazole Since no dose recommendation for itraconazole can be made, alternative antifungal treatment should be considered. ketoconazole ↓ ketoconazole Drug interaction trials with ATRIPLA and ketoconazole have not been conducted. Efavirenz has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of ketoconazole. posaconazole ↓ posaconazole Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit outweighs the risks. Anti-infective: clarithromycin ↓ clarithromycin ↑ 14-OH metabolite Clinical significance unknown. In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving efavirenz and clarithromycin. No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is recommended when given with clarithromycin. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Other macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, have not been studied in combination with ATRIPLA. Antimycobacterial: rifabutin ↓ rifabutin Increase daily dose of rifabutin by 50%. Consider doubling the rifabutin dose in regimens where rifabutin is given 2 or 3 times a week. rifampin ↓ efavirenz If ATRIPLA is coadministered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an additional 200 mg/day of efavirenz is recommended. Antimalarials: artemether/lumefantrine ↓ artemether ↓ dihydroartemisinin ↓ lumefantrine Artemether/lumefantrine should be used cautiously with ATRIPLA because decreased artemether, dihydroartemisinin (active metabolite of artemether), and/or lumefantrine concentrations may result in a decrease of antimalarial efficacy of artemether/lumefantrine. Calcium channel blockers: diltiazem ↓ diltiazem ↓ desacetyl diltiazem ↓ N-monodes-methyl diltiazem Diltiazem dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for diltiazem). No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is necessary when administered with diltiazem. Others (e.g., felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) ↓ calcium channel blocker No data are available on the potential interactions of efavirenz with other calcium channel blockers that are substrates of CYP3A. The potential exists for reduction in plasma concentrations of the calcium channel blocker. Dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for the calcium channel blocker). HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: atorvastatin pravastatin simvastatin ↓ atorvastatin ↓ pravastatin ↓ simvastatin Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin decreased with efavirenz. Consult the full prescribing information for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for guidance on individualizing the dose. Hormonal contraceptives: Oral: ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate ↓ active metabolites of norgestimate A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. Efavirenz had no effect on ethinyl estradiol concentrations, but progestin levels (norelgestromin and levonorgestrel) were markedly decreased. No effect of ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate on efavirenz plasma concentrations was observed. Implant: etonogestrel ↓ etonogestrel A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. The interaction between etonogestrel and efavirenz has not been studied. Decreased exposure of etonogestrel may be expected. There have been postmarketing reports of contraceptive failure with etonogestrel in efavirenz-exposed patients. Immunosuppressants: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and others metabolized by CYP3A ↓ immuno-suppressant Decreased exposure of the immunosuppressant may be expected due to CYP3A induction by efavirenz. These immunosuppressants are not anticipated to affect exposure of efavirenz. Dose adjustments of the immunosuppressant may be required. Close monitoring of immunosuppressant concentrations for at least 2 weeks (until stable concentrations are reached) is recommended when starting or stopping treatment with ATRIPLA. Narcotic analgesic: methadone ↓ methadone Coadministration of efavirenz in HIV-1 infected individuals with a history of injection drug use resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal. Methadone dose was increased by a mean of 22% to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be monitored for signs of withdrawal and their methadone dose increased as required to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. 7.4 Efavirenz Assay Interference Cannabinoid Test Interaction: Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV-infected subjects receiving efavirenz. Confirmation of positive screening tests for cannabinoids by a more specific method is recommended."

Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects Study 934 Study 934 was an open-label active-controlled trial in which 511 antiretroviral-naive subjects received either emtricitabine + tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254). The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934 include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. Adverse reactions observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials of the individual components (Table 1). Table 1 Selected Treatment-Emergent Adverse ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug. (Grades 2–4) Reported in ≥5% in Either Treatment Group in Study 934 (0–144 Weeks) FTC + TDF + EFVFrom Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine + tenofovir DF with efavirenz. AZT/3TC + EFV N=257 N=254 Gastrointestinal Disorder Diarrhea 9% 5% Nausea 9% 7% Vomiting 2% 5% General Disorders and Administration Site Condition Fatigue 9% 8% Infections and Infestations Sinusitis 8% 4% Upper respiratory tract infections 8% 5% Nasopharyngitis 5% 3% Nervous System Disorders Headache 6% 5% Dizziness 8% 7% Psychiatric Disorders Anxiety 5% 4% Depression 9% 7% Insomnia 5% 7% Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash EventRash event includes rash, exfoliative rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculopapular, rash pruritic, and rash vesicular. 7% 9% Study 073 In Study 073, subjects with stable, virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy and no history of virologic failure were randomized to receive ATRIPLA or to stay on their baseline regimen. The adverse reactions observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those seen in Study 934 and those seen with the individual components of ATRIPLA when each was administered in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, or Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate In addition to the adverse reactions in Study 934 and Study 073, the following adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Efavirenz: The most significant adverse reactions observed in subjects treated with efavirenz are nervous system symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], psychiatric symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], and rash [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Selected adverse reactions of moderate-to-severe intensity observed in greater than or equal to 2% of efavirenz-treated subjects in two controlled clinical trials included pain, impaired concentration, abnormal dreams, somnolence, anorexia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nervousness, and pruritus. Pancreatitis has also been reported, although a causal relationship with efavirenz has not been established. Asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels were observed in a significantly higher number of subjects treated with efavirenz 600 mg than in control subjects. Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials include arthralgia, increased cough, dyspepsia, fever, myalgia, pain, abdominal pain, back pain, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), pneumonia, rhinitis and rash event (including rash, pruritus, maculopapular rash, urticaria, vesiculobullous rash, pustular rash, and allergic reaction). Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects Efavirenz: Assessment of adverse reactions is based on three pediatric clinical trials in 182 HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 3 months to 21 years of age, who received efavirenz in combination with other antiretroviral agents for a median of 123 weeks. The type and frequency of adverse reactions in the three trials were generally similar to that of adult subjects with the exception of a higher incidence of rash, which was reported in 32% (59/182) of pediatric subjects compared to 26% of adults, and a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 rash reported in 3% (6/182) of pediatric subjects compared to 0.9% of adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. For additional information, please consult the SUSTIVA prescribing information. Emtricitabine: In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with emtricitabine in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, please consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a pediatric clinical trial conducted in subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with tenofovir DF were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of tenofovir DF in adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. 6.2 Laboratory Abnormalities Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Laboratory abnormalities observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials (Table 2). Table 2 Significant Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in ≥1% of Subjects in Either Treatment Group in Study 934 (0–144 Weeks) FTC + TDF + EFVFrom Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine + tenofovir DF with efavirenz. AZT/3TC + EFV N=257 N=254 Any ≥ Grade 3 Laboratory Abnormality 30% 26% Fasting Cholesterol (>240 mg/dL) 22% 24% Creatine Kinase (M: >990 U/L) (F: >845 U/L) 9% 7% Serum Amylase (>175 U/L) 8% 4% Alkaline Phosphatase (>550 U/L) 1% 0% AST (M: >180 U/L) (F: >170 U/L) 3% 3% ALT (M: >215 U/L) (F: >170 U/L) 2% 3% Hemoglobin (<8.0 mg/dL) 0% 4% Hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL) 2% 1% Hematuria (>75 RBC/HPF) 3% 2% Glycosuria (≥3+) <1% 1% Neutrophils (<750/mm3) 3% 5% Fasting Triglycerides (>750 mg/dL) 4% 2% Laboratory abnormalities observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those in Study 934. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described for Study 934 (Table 2), Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (greater than 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)), increased pancreatic amylase (greater than 2.0 × ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (less than 40 or greater than 250 mg/dL), and increased serum lipase (greater than 2.0 × ULN) occurred in up to 3% of subjects treated with emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Hepatic Events: In Study 934, 19 subjects treated with efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF and 20 subjects treated with efavirenz and fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine were hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody positive. Among these coinfected subjects, one subject (1/19) in the efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF arm had elevations in transaminases to greater than five times ULN through 144 weeks. In the fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine arm, two subjects (2/20) had elevations in transaminases to greater than five times ULN through 144 weeks. No HBV and/or HCV coinfected subject discontinued from the trial due to hepatobiliary disorders [See Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Efavirenz: Cardiac Disorders Palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Tinnitus, vertigo Endocrine Disorders Gynecomastia Eye Disorders Abnormal vision Gastrointestinal Disorders Constipation, malabsorption General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Asthenia Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatic enzyme increase, hepatic failure, hepatitis. A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, were characterized by a fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death. Immune System Disorders Allergic reactions Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [See Warnings and Precautions (5.14)], hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia, myalgia, myopathy Nervous System Disorders Abnormal coordination, ataxia, cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, convulsions, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, neuropathy, tremor Psychiatric Disorders Aggressive reactions, agitation, delusions, emotional lability, mania, neurosis, paranoia, psychosis, suicide Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Flushing, erythema multiforme, photoallergic dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome Emtricitabine: No postmarketing adverse reactions have been identified for inclusion in this section. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Immune System Disorders Allergic reaction, including angioedema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders Pancreatitis, increased amylase, abdominal pain Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes (most commonly AST, ALT, gamma GT) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and which may contribute to fractures), muscular weakness, myopathy Renal and Urinary Disorders Acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, interstitial nephritis (including acute cases), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal insufficiency, increased creatinine, proteinuria, polyuria General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Asthenia The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, hypophosphatemia."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious psychiatric symptoms: Immediate medical evaluation is recommended. (5.5, 6.1) Nervous system symptoms (NSS): NSS are frequent, usually begin 1–2 days after initiating therapy and resolve in 2–4 weeks. Dosing at bedtime may improve tolerability. NSS are not predictive of onset of psychiatric symptoms. (2, 5.6) New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess estimated creatinine clearance before initiating treatment with ATRIPLA. In patients at risk for renal dysfunction, assess estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose and urine protein before initiating treatment with ATRIPLA and periodically during treatment. Avoid administering ATRIPLA with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.7) Pregnancy: Fetal harm may occur when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. A pregnancy registry is available. (5.8, 8.1) Rash: Discontinue if severe rash develops. (5.9, 6.1) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment in patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C coinfection, marked transaminase elevations, or who are taking medications associated with liver toxicity. Among reported cases of hepatic failure, a few occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease. (5.10, 6.3, 8.6) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathological fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.11) Convulsions: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures. (5.12) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.13) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.14) Coadministration with other products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, STRIBILD, TRUVADA, or VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. SUSTIVA (efavirenz) should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless required for dose-adjustment when coadministered with rifampin. (5.4) Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.2) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs including tenofovir DF, a component of ATRIPLA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with ATRIPLA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic HBV before initiating antiretroviral therapy. ATRIPLA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, and the safety and efficacy of ATRIPLA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of ATRIPLA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with emtricitabine, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with ATRIPLA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. ATRIPLA should not be administered with HEPSERA® (adefovir dipivoxil) [See Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.3 Drug Interactions Efavirenz plasma concentrations may be altered by substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A. Likewise, efavirenz may alter plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2B6. The most prominent effect of efavirenz at steady-state is induction of CYP3A and CYP2B6. [ Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Coadministration with Related Products Related drugs not for coadministration with ATRIPLA include COMPLERA® (emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF), EMTRIVA® (emtricitabine), STRIBILD® (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF), TRUVADA® (emtricitabine/tenofovir DF), and VIREAD® (tenofovir DF), which contain the same active components as ATRIPLA. SUSTIVA® (efavirenz) should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless needed for dose-adjustment (e.g., with rifampin) [See Dosage and Administration (2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, ATRIPLA should not be coadministered with drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir, or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). 5.5 Psychiatric Symptoms Serious psychiatric adverse experiences have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. In controlled trials of 1008 subjects treated with regimens containing efavirenz for a mean of 2.1 years and 635 subjects treated with control regimens for a mean of 1.5 years, the frequency (regardless of causality) of specific serious psychiatric events among subjects who received efavirenz or control regimens, respectively, were: severe depression (2.4%, 0.9%), suicidal ideation (0.7%, 0.3%), nonfatal suicide attempts (0.5%, 0%), aggressive behavior (0.4%, 0.5%), paranoid reactions (0.4%, 0.3%), and manic reactions (0.2%, 0.3%). When psychiatric symptoms similar to those noted above were combined and evaluated as a group in a multifactorial analysis of data from Study AI266006 (006), treatment with efavirenz was associated with an increase in the occurrence of these selected psychiatric symptoms. Other factors associated with an increase in the occurrence of these psychiatric symptoms were history of injection drug use, psychiatric history, and receipt of psychiatric medication at trial entry; similar associations were observed in both the efavirenz and control treatment groups. In Study 006, onset of new serious psychiatric symptoms occurred throughout the trial for both efavirenz-treated and control-treated subjects. One percent of efavirenz-treated subjects discontinued or interrupted treatment because of one or more of these selected psychiatric symptoms. There have also been occasional postmarketing reports of death by suicide, delusions, and psychosis-like behavior, although a causal relationship to the use of efavirenz cannot be determined from these reports. Patients with serious psychiatric adverse experiences should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits [See Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.6 Nervous System Symptoms Fifty-three percent (531/1008) of subjects receiving efavirenz in controlled trials reported central nervous system symptoms (any grade, regardless of causality) compared to 25% (156/635) of subjects receiving control regimens. These symptoms included dizziness (28.1% of the 1008 subjects), insomnia (16.3%), impaired concentration (8.3%), somnolence (7.0%), abnormal dreams (6.2%), and hallucinations (1.2%). Other reported symptoms were euphoria, confusion, agitation, amnesia, stupor, abnormal thinking, and depersonalization. The majority of these symptoms were mild-to-moderate (50.7%); symptoms were severe in 2.0% of subjects. Overall, 2.1% of subjects discontinued therapy as a result. These symptoms usually begin during the first or second day of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2–4 weeks of therapy. After 4 weeks of therapy, the prevalence of nervous system symptoms of at least moderate severity ranged from 5% to 9% in subjects treated with regimens containing efavirenz and from 3% to 5% in subjects treated with a control regimen. Patients should be informed that these common symptoms were likely to improve with continued therapy and were not predictive of subsequent onset of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of these nervous system symptoms [See Dosage and Administration (2)]. Analysis of long-term data from Study 006 (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for subjects treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated subjects were generally similar to those in the indinavir-containing control arm. Patients receiving ATRIPLA should be alerted to the potential for additive central nervous system effects when ATRIPLA is used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms such as dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or drowsiness should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. 5.7 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney; however, efavirenz is not. Since ATRIPLA is a combination product and the dose of the individual components cannot be altered, patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min should not receive ATRIPLA. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. It is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance be assessed in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with ATRIPLA. In patients at risk of renal dysfunction, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA, it is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed prior to initiation of ATRIPLA, and periodically during ATRIPLA therapy. ATRIPLA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [See Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients. 5.8 Reproductive Risk Potential Pregnancy Category D: Efavirenz may cause fetal harm when administered during the first trimester to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving ATRIPLA. Barrier contraception must always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (e.g., oral or other hormonal contraceptives). Because of the long half-life of efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of ATRIPLA is recommended. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of ATRIPLA. If this drug is used during the first trimester of pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of ATRIPLA in pregnant women. ATRIPLA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus, such as in pregnant women without other therapeutic options [See Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Rash In controlled clinical trials, 26% (266/1008) of adult subjects treated with 600 mg efavirenz experienced new-onset skin rash compared with 17% (111/635) of those treated in control groups. Rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation, or ulceration occurred in 0.9% (9/1008) of subjects treated with efavirenz. The incidence of Grade 4 rash (e.g., erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in adult subjects treated with efavirenz in all trials and expanded access was 0.1%. Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 2 weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz (median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days) and, in most subjects continuing therapy with efavirenz, rash resolves within 1 month (median duration, 16 days). The discontinuation rate for rash in adult clinical trials was 1.7% (17/1008). ATRIPLA can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement, or fever. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. For patients who have had a life-threatening cutaneous reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome), alternative therapy should be considered [See Contraindications (4.1)]. Experience with efavirenz in subjects who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited. Nineteen subjects who discontinued nevirapine because of rash have been treated with efavirenz. Nine of these subjects developed mild-to-moderate rash while receiving therapy with efavirenz, and two of these subjects discontinued because of rash. Rash was reported in 59 of 182 pediatric subjects (32%) treated with efavirenz [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Two pediatric subjects experienced Grade 3 rash (confluent rash with fever, generalized rash), and four subjects had Grade 4 rash (erythema multiforme). The median time to onset of rash in pediatric subjects was 28 days (range 3–1642 days). Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines before initiating therapy with ATRIPLA in pediatric patients should be considered. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Monitoring of liver enzymes before and during treatment is recommended for patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C infection; patients with marked transaminase elevations; and patients treated with other medications associated with liver toxicity [See also Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Liver enzyme monitoring should also be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. In patients with persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued therapy with ATRIPLA needs to be weighed against the unknown risks of significant liver toxicity [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.11 Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF Bone Mineral Density: In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, tenofovir DF was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. Clinical trials evaluating tenofovir DF in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the tenofovir DF treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in chronic hepatitis B infected adolescent subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. For more information, consult the VIREAD prescribing information. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects: Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 5.12 Convulsions Convulsions have been observed in adult and pediatric patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of known medical history of seizures. Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medications primarily metabolized by the liver, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels [See Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.13 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including the components of ATRIPLA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.14 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS GENVOYA should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. (5.3, 7.1) GENVOYA can alter the concentration of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A can alter the concentrations of one or more components of GENVOYA. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug-drug interactions. (4, 7.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Other Antiretroviral Medications GENVOYA is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, coadministration of GENVOYA with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection should be avoided. Complete information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided [see Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Potential for GENVOYA to Affect Other Drugs Cobicistat, a component of GENVOYA, is an inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of the following transporters: p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Thus, coadministration of GENVOYA with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6, or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs (see Table 5). Elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9 and may decrease the plasma concentrations of CYP2C9 substrates. TAF is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or UGT1A1. TAF is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A in vitro. 7.3 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect One or More Components of GENVOYA Elvitegravir and cobicistat, components of GENVOYA, are metabolized by CYP3A. Cobicistat is also metabolized, to a minor extent, by CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity are expected to increase the clearance of elvitegravir and cobicistat, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of cobicistat, elvitegravir, and TAF, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of GENVOYA and development of resistance (see Table 5). Coadministration of GENVOYA with other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance and increase the plasma concentration of cobicistat (see Table 5). TAF, a component of GENVOYA, is a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Drugs that inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP, such as cobicistat, may increase the absorption of TAF (see Table 10). However, when TAF is administered as a component of GENVOYA, its availability is increased by cobicistat and a further increase of TAF concentrations is not expected upon coadministration of an additional P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitor. Drugs that induce P-gp activity are expected to decrease the absorption of TAF, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of TAF. 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Because emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of GENVOYA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 7.5 Established and Other Potentially Significant Interactions Table 5 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either GENVOYA, the components of GENVOYA (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide) as individual agents and/or in combination, or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with GENVOYA [for magnitude of interaction, see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The table includes potentially significant interactions but is not all inclusive. Table 5 Established and Other Potentially SignificantThis table is not all inclusive. Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration↑ = Increase, ↓ = Decrease, ↔ = No Effect Clinical Comment Acid Reducing Agents: antacidsIndicates that a drug-drug interaction trial was conducted. e.g., aluminum and magnesium hydroxide ↓ elvitegravir Separate GENVOYA and antacid administration by at least 2 hours. Antiarrhythmics: e.g., amiodarone bepridil digoxin disopyramide flecainide systemic lidocaine mexiletine propafenone quinidine ↑ antiarrhythmics ↑ digoxin Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring, if available, is recommended for antiarrhythmics when coadministered with GENVOYA. Antibacterials: clarithromycin telithromycin ↑ clarithromycin ↑ telithromycin ↑ cobicistat Patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute: No dosage adjustment of clarithromycin is required. Patients with CLcr between 50 mL/minute and 60 mL/minute: The dosage of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%. Anticoagulants: warfarin Effect on warfarin unknown Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) upon coadministration with GENVOYA. Anticonvulsants: ethosuximide oxcarbazepine ↑ ethosuximide ↓ elvitegravir ↓ cobicistat ↓ TAF Alternative anticonvulsants should be considered when GENVOYA is administered with oxcarbazepine. Clinical monitoring is recommended upon coadministration of ethosuximide with GENVOYA. Antidepressants: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) e.g., paroxetine Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) e.g., amitriptyline desipramine imipramine nortriptyline bupropion trazodone ↑ SSRIs (except sertraline) ↑ TCAs ↑ trazodone Careful dosage titration of the antidepressant and monitoring for antidepressant response are recommended when coadministered with GENVOYA. Antifungals: itraconazole ketoconazole voriconazole ↑ elvitegravir ↑ cobicistat ↑ itraconazole ↑ ketoconazole ↑ voriconazole When administering with GENVOYA, the maximum daily dosage of ketoconazole or itraconazole should not exceed 200 mg per day. An assessment of benefit/risk ratio is recommended to justify use of voriconazole with GENVOYA. Anti-gout: colchicine ↑ colchicine GENVOYA is not recommended to be coadministered with colchicine to patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Treatment of gout-flares – coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving GENVOYA: 0.6 mg (1 tablet) × 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Treatment course to be repeated no earlier than 3 days. Prophylaxis of gout-flares – coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving GENVOYA: If the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day. If the original regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day. Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever – coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving GENVOYA: Maximum daily dosage of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day). Antimycobacterial: rifabutin rifapentine ↓ elvitegravir ↓ cobicistat ↓ TAF Coadministration of GENVOYA with rifabutin or rifapentine is not recommended. Antipsychotics: quetiapine ↑ quetiapine Initiation of GENVOYA in patients taking quetiapine: Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposure. If coadministration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring. Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking GENVOYA: Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine. Benzodiazepines: e.g., Parenterally administered midazolam clorazepate diazepam estazolam flurazepam lorazepam ↑ diazepam ↔ lorazepam ↑ midazolam Coadministration of GENVOYA with diazepam or parenterally administered midazolam should be done in a setting that ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. Based on non-CYP-mediated elimination pathways for lorazepam, no effect on plasma concentrations is expected upon coadministration with GENVOYA. Beta-Blockers: e.g., metoprolol timolol ↑ beta-blockers Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dosage decrease of the beta blocker may be necessary when these agents are coadministered with GENVOYA. Calcium Channel Blockers: e.g., amlodipine diltiazem felodipine nicardipine nifedipine verapamil ↑ calcium channel blockers Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring is recommended upon coadministration of calcium channel blockers with GENVOYA. Corticosteroid: Systemic: dexamethasone ↓ elvitegravir ↓ cobicistat An alternative corticosteroid should be considered for coadministration with GENVOYA. Corticosteroid: Inhaled/Nasal: fluticasone ↑ fluticasone Alternative corticosteroids should be considered, particularly for long term use. Endothelin Receptor Antagonists: bosentan ↑ bosentan Coadministration of bosentan in patients on GENVOYA: In patients who have been receiving GENVOYA for at least 10 days, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability. Coadministration of GENVOYA in patients on bosentan: Discontinue use of bosentan at least 36 hours prior to initiation of GENVOYA. After at least 10 days following the initiation of GENVOYA, resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: atorvastatin ↑ atorvastatin Initiate with the lowest starting dose of atorvastatin and titrate carefully while monitoring for safety. Hormonal Contraceptives: norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol ↑ norgestimate ↓ ethinyl estradiol The effects of increases in the concentration of the progestational component norgestimate are not fully known and can include increased risk of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne, and venous thrombosis. The potential risks and benefits associated with coadministration of norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol with GENVOYA should be considered, particularly in women who have risk factors for these events. The effect of GENVOYA on other hormonal contraceptives (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive vaginal ring, or injectable contraceptives) or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate is not known; therefore, alternative (non-hormonal) methods of contraception can be considered. Immuno-suppressants: e.g., cyclosporine (CsA) sirolimus tacrolimus ↑ immuno-suppressants ↑ elvitegravir (with CsA) ↑ cobicistat (with CsA) Therapeutic monitoring of the immunosuppressive agents is recommended upon coadministration with GENVOYA. Monitor for adverse events associated with GENVOYA when coadministered with cyclosporine. Narcotic Analgesics: buprenorphine/naloxone ↑ buprenorphine ↑ norbuprenorphine ↓ naloxone No dosage adjustment of buprenorphine/naloxone is required upon coadministration with GENVOYA. Patients should be closely monitored for sedation and cognitive effects. Inhaled Beta Agonist: salmeterol ↑ salmeterol Coadministration of salmeterol and GENVOYA is not recommended. Coadministration of salmeterol with GENVOYA may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations, and sinus tachycardia. Neuroleptics: e.g., perphenazine risperidone thioridazine ↑ neuroleptics A decrease in dosage of the neuroleptic may be needed when coadministered with GENVOYA. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) Inhibitors: sildenafil tadalafil vardenafil ↑ PDE5 inhibitors Coadministration with GENVOYA may result in an increase in PDE-5 inhibitor associated adverse reactions, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances, and priapism. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): Use of sildenafil is contraindicated when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The following dose adjustments are recommended for the use of tadalafil with GENVOYA: Coadministration of tadalafil in patients on GENVOYA: In patients receiving GENVOYA for at least 1 week, start tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase tadalafil dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Coadministration of GENVOYA in patients on tadalafil: Avoid use of tadalafil during the initiation of GENVOYA. Stop tadalafil at least 24 hours prior to starting GENVOYA. After at least one week following initiation of GENVOYA, resume tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase tadalafil dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction: Sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg in 72 hours, or tadalafil at a single dose not exceeding 10 mg in 72 hours can be used with increased monitoring for PDE-5 inhibitor associated with adverse events. Sedative/hypnotics: buspirone zolpidem ↑ sedatives/hypnotics With sedative/hypnotics, dose reduction may be necessary and clinical monitoring is recommended. 7.6 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with GENVOYA Based on drug interaction studies conducted with the components of GENVOYA, no clinically significant drug interactions have been either observed or are expected when GENVOYA is combined with the following drugs: entecavir, famciclovir, H2 receptor antagonists, ledipasvir, lorazepam, methadone, proton pump inhibitors, ribavirin, sertraline, and sofosbuvir.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse drug reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Most common adverse reaction (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) is nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Treatment Naïve Adults The primary safety assessment of GENVOYA was based on Week 48 pooled data from 1733 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trials, Study 104 and Study 111, in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult subjects. A total of 866 subjects received one tablet of GENVOYA once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The most common adverse reaction (all Grades) reported in at least 10% of subjects in the GENVOYA group was nausea. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with GENVOYA or STRIBILD® due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively. Table 2 displays the frequency of adverse reactions (all Grades) greater than or equal to 5% in the GENVOYA group. Table 2 Adverse ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all adverse events attributed to study drugs by the investigator. (All Grades) Reported in ≥ 5% of HIV-1 Infected Treatment Naïve Adults Receiving GENVOYA in Studies 104 and 111 (Week 48 analysis) GENVOYA N=866 STRIBILD N=867 GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS Diarrhea 7% 9% Nausea 10% 13% GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS Fatigue 5% 4% NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS Headache 6% 5% The majority of events presented in Table 2 occurred at severity Grade 1. Clinical Trials in Virologically Suppressed Adults The safety of GENVOYA in virologically-suppressed adults was based on Week 48 data from 959 subjects in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (Study 109) in which virologically-suppressed subjects were switched from a TDF-containing combination regimen to GENVOYA one tablet taken orally once daily. Overall, the safety profile of GENVOYA in subjects in this study was similar to that of treatment naïve subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects with Renal Impairment In an open-label trial (Study 112), 248 HIV-1 infected subjects with eGFR of 30 to 69 mL per minute (by Cockcroft-Gault method) were treated with GENVOYA for a median duration of 43 weeks. Of these subjects, 64% had previously been on a stable TDF-containing regimen. Among the 80 subjects with baseline eGFR less than 50 mL per minute receiving GENVOYA, two subjects developed worsening renal impairment and discontinued treatment. One subject with an eGFR over 50 mL per minute developed transient acute renal failure. Otherwise, the safety profile of GENVOYA in subjects in this study was similar to that of subjects with normal renal function [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Renal Laboratory Tests Treatment Naïve Adults: In two 48-week randomized, controlled trials in a total of 1733 treatment naïve adults with a median baseline eGFR of 115 mL per minute, mean serum creatinine increased by 0.1 mg per dL in the GENVOYA and STRIBILD groups from baseline to Week 48. Median urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) was 44 mg per gram at baseline and at Week 48 in the GENVOYA group. Median UPCR was 44 mg per gram at baseline and 55 mg per gram at Week 48 in those receiving STRIBILD. Virologically Suppressed Adults: In a study of 1436 virologically-suppressed TDF-treated adults with a mean baseline eGFR of 112 mL per minute who were randomized to continue their treatment regimen or switch to GENVOYA, at Week 48 mean serum creatinine was similar to baseline for both those continuing baseline treatment and those switching to GENVOYA. Median UPCR was 61 mg per gram at baseline and 46 mg per gram at Week 48 in subjects switching to GENVOYA. In subjects remaining on their initial regimen, UPCR was 60 mg per gram at baseline and 63 mg per gram at Week 48. Adult Subjects with Renal Impairment: In a 24-week trial in 248 subjects with renal impairment (baseline eGFR 30 to 69 mL per minute) who received GENVOYA, mean serum creatinine was 1.5 mg per dL at both baseline and Week 24. Median UPCR was 161 mg per gram at baseline and 93 mg per gram at Week 24. Bone Mineral Density Effects Treatment Naïve Adults: In the pooled analysis of Studies 104 and 111, bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to Week 48 was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to compare the bone safety of TAF to that of TDF when administered as GENVOYA or STRIBILD, respectively. Mean BMD decreased from baseline to Week 48 -1.30% with GENVOYA compared to -2.86% with STRIBILD at the lumbar spine and -0.66% compared to -2.95% at the total hip. BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 10% of GENVOYA subjects and 22% of STRIBILD subjects. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 7% of GENVOYA subjects and 19% of STRIBILD subjects. The long-term clinical significance of these BMD changes is not known. Fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 7 (0.8%) subjects in the GENVOYA group and 12 (1.4%) subjects in the STRIBILD group through 48 weeks. Virologically Suppressed Adults: In Study 109, TDF-treated subjects were randomized to continue their TDF-based regimen or switch to GENVOYA; changes in BMD from baseline to Week 48 were assessed by DXA. Mean BMD increased in subjects who switched to GENVOYA (1.86% lumbar spine, 1.95% total hip) and decreased slightly in subjects who continued their baseline regimen (-0.11% lumbar spine, -0.14% total hip). BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine were experienced by 1% of GENVOYA subjects and 6% of subjects who continued their TDF-based regimen. BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were experienced by 1% of GENVOYA subjects and 4% of subjects who continued their TDF-based regimen. Fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 10 (1%) subjects who switched to GENVOYA and 2 (0.4%) subjects who continued their TDF-based regimen through 48 weeks. Laboratory Abnormalities: The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3–4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving GENVOYA in Studies 104 and 111 are presented in Table 3. Table 3 Laboratory Abnormalities (Grades 3–4) Reported in ≥ 2% of Subjects Receiving GENVOYA in Studies 104 and 111 (Week 48 analysis) Laboratory Parameter AbnormalityFrequencies are based on treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities.

The safety profile in 23 adolescent subjects who received treatment with GENVOYA was similar to that in adults. One 13 year old female subject developed unexplained uveitis while receiving GENVOYA that resolved and did not require discontinuation of GENVOYA. Among the 23 pediatric subjects receiving GENVOYA for 24 weeks, mean BMD increased from baseline to Week 24, + 1.7% at the lumbar spine and + 0.8% for the total body less head. Mean changes from baseline BMD Z-scores were -0.10 for lumbar spine and -0.11 for total body less head at Week 24. Two GENVOYA subjects had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at Week 24."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Avoid coadministration with other antiretroviral products: Do not use with drugs containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, ritonavir, or adefovir dipivoxil. (5.3) Risk of adverse reactions or loss of virologic response due to drug interactions: The concomitant use of GENVOYA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of GENVOYA and possible development of resistance; and possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. (5.4) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.6) New onset or worsening renal impairment: Assess creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients before initiating GENVOYA therapy and monitor during therapy. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. (5.7) Bone loss and mineralization defects: Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.8) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with GENVOYA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations) [see Boxed Warning]. 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. GENVOYA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of GENVOYA have not been established in patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine and/or TDF, and may occur with GENVOYA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with emtricitabine, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue GENVOYA should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure [see Boxed Warning]. 5.3 Avoid Use with Other Antiretroviral Products Coadministration of GENVOYA with other antiretroviral products is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. GENVOYA is not recommended for coadministration with drugs that contain any of the following: elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, ritonavir. 5.4 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of GENVOYA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.5)]: Loss of therapeutic effect of GENVOYA and possible development of resistance. Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. See Table 5 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during GENVOYA therapy; review concomitant medications during GENVOYA therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution or accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including emtricitabine, a component of GENVOYA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir prodrugs in both animal toxicology studies and human trials. In clinical trials of GENVOYA, there have been no cases of Fanconi syndrome or Proximal Renal Tubulopathy (PRT). In clinical trials of GENVOYA in treatment naïve subjects and in virally suppressed subjects switched to GENVOYA with eGFRs greater than 50 mL per minute, renal serious adverse events or discontinuations due to renal adverse reactions were encountered in less than 1% of participants treated with GENVOYA. In a study of virally suppressed subjects with baseline eGFRs between 30 and 69 mL per minute treated with GENVOYA for a median duration of 43 weeks, GENVOYA was permanently discontinued due to worsening renal function in two of 80 (3%) subjects with a baseline eGFR between 30 and 50 mL per minute [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. GENVOYA is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL per minute because data in this population are insufficient. Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are at increased risk of developing renal-related adverse reactions. Estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein should be assessed before initiating GENVOYA therapy and should be monitored during therapy in all patients. Serum phosphorus should be monitored in patients with chronic kidney disease because these patients are at greater risk of developing Fanconi syndrome on tenofovir prodrugs. Discontinue GENVOYA in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Cobicistat, a component of GENVOYA, produces elevations of serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting glomerular filtration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The elevation is typically seen within 2 weeks of starting therapy and is reversible after discontinuation. Patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. 5.8 Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects Bone Mineral Density (BMD): In animal toxicology studies and human clinical trials, TAF and tenofovir have been associated with decreases in bone mineral density and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism suggestive of increased bone turnover. In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve adults, a significant decline in bone mineral density was observed in 15% of subjects treated with GENVOYA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The long-term clinical significance of these changes has not been established. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adults and pediatric patients treated with GENVOYA who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects: Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of TDF-containing products. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy have occurred in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing TDF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. While not observed in clinical studies of GENVOYA, the risk of osteomalacia with GENVOYA is not known."

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%, any severity) identified from any of the 3 large controlled clinical trials include headache, diarrhea nausea, fatigue, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, rash, abdominal pain, asthenia, increased cough, and rhinitis. Studies 301A and 303 - Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving EMTRIVA with other antiretroviral agents in clinical studies 301A and 303 were headache, diarrhea, nausea, and rash, which were generally of mild to moderate severity. Approximately 1% of patients discontinued participation in the clinical studies due to these events. All adverse reactions were reported with similar frequency in EMTRIVA and control treatment groups with the exception of skin discoloration which was reported with higher frequency in the EMTRIVA treated group. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Products with same active ingredient: Do not use with other emtricitabine-containing products (e.g., ATRIPLA, COMPLERA and TRUVADA). (5.3) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.6) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs alone or in combination, including emtricitabine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver diseases; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EMTRIVA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy. EMTRIVA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of EMTRIVA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of Hepatitis B have been reported in patients after the discontinuation of EMTRIVA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue EMTRIVA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-Hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 Coadministration with Related Products EMTRIVA is a component of ATRIPLA (a fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), COMPLERA (a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and TRUVADA (a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). EMTRIVA should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, or TRUVADA. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, EMTRIVA should not be coadministered with other drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). 5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine is principally eliminated by the kidney. Reduction of the dosage of EMTRIVA is recommended for patients with impaired renal function [See Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EMTRIVA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS COMPLERA is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, COMPLERA should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications. Information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided. Please refer to the EDURANT, VIREAD and EMTRIVA prescribing information as needed. There were no drug-drug interaction trials conducted with the fixed-dose combination tablet. Drug interaction studies were conducted with emtricitabine, rilpivirine, or tenofovir DF, the components of COMPLERA. This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions with COMPLERA [See Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. COMPLERA is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, COMPLERA should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors: Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may affect the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. (7.1) Drugs that increase gastric pH: Drugs that increase gastric pH may decrease plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Inducing or Inhibiting CYP3A Enzymes Rilpivirine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, and drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Contraindications (4)]. Coadministration of rilpivirine and drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine and loss of virologic response and possible resistance to rilpivirine or to the class of NNRTIs. Coadministration of rilpivirine and drugs that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. Rilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes. 7.2 Drugs Increasing Gastric pH Coadministration of rilpivirine with drugs that increase gastric pH may decrease plasma concentrations of rilpivirine and loss of virologic response and possible resistance to rilpivirine or to the class of NNRTIs [See Table 4]. 7.3 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Because emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys through a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of COMPLERA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, and valganciclovir. 7.4 QT Prolonging Drugs There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between rilpivirine and drugs that prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram. In a study of healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. COMPLERA should be used with caution when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. 7.5 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Important drug interaction information for COMPLERA is summarized in Table 4. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with emtricitabine, rilpivirine, or tenofovir DF as individual medications that may occur with COMPLERA or are potential drug interactions; no drug interaction studies have been conducted using COMPLERA [for pharmacokinetic data see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Tables 6–7]. The tables include potentially significant interactions, but are not all inclusive. Table 4 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration Clinical Comment Antacids: antacids (e.g., aluminium, magnesium hydroxide, or calcium carbonate) ↔ rilpivirine (antacids taken at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after rilpivirine) ↓ rilpivirine (concomitant intake) The combination of COMPLERA and antacids should be used with caution as coadministration may cause significant decreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations (increase in gastric pH). Antacids should only be administered either at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after COMPLERA. Azole Antifungal Agents: fluconazole itraconazole ketoconazole posaconazole voriconazole ↑ rilpivirineThe interaction was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug-drug interactions shown are predicted. , This interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for rilpivirine. The dosing recommendation is applicable to the recommended dose of rilpivirine 25 mg once daily. ↓ ketoconazole , Concomitant use of COMPLERA with azole antifungal agents may cause an increase in the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine (inhibition of CYP3A enzymes). No dose adjustment is required when COMPLERA is coadministered with azole antifungal agents. Clinically monitor for breakthrough fungal infections when azole antifungals are coadministered with COMPLERA. H2-Receptor Antagonists: cimetidine famotidine nizatidine ranitidine ↔ rilpivirine , (famotidine taken 12 hours before rilpivirine or 4 hours after rilpivirine) ↓ rilpivirine , (famotidine taken 2 hours before rilpivirine) The combination of COMPLERA and H2-receptor antagonists should be used with caution as coadministration may cause significant decreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations (increase in gastric pH). H2-receptor antagonists should only be administered at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after COMPLERA. Macrolide or Ketolide Antibiotics: clarithromycin erythromycin telithromycin ↑ rilpivirine ↔ clarithromycin ↔ erythromycin ↔ telithromycin Concomitant use of COMPLERA with clarithromycin, erythromycin or telithromycin may cause an increase in the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine (inhibition of CYP3A enzymes). Where possible, alternatives such as azithromycin should be considered. Narcotic Analgesics: methadone ↓ R(–) methadone ↓ S(+) methadone ↔ rilpivirine ↔ methadone (when used with tenofovir) No dose adjustments are required when initiating coadministration of methadone with COMPLERA. However, clinical monitoring is recommended as methadone maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients. 7.6 Drugs with No Observed or Predicted Interactions with COMPLERA No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between emtricitabine and the following medications: famciclovir or tenofovir DF. Similarly, no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between tenofovir DF and the following medications: entecavir, methadone, oral contraceptives, ribavirin, or tacrolimus in studies conducted in healthy subjects. No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between rilpivirine and the following medications: acetaminophen, atorvastatin, chlorzoxazone, ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone, sildenafil, or tenofovir DF. No clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is expected when rilpivirine is coadministered with ribavirin."

Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Most common adverse drug reactions to rilpivirine (incidence greater than or equal to 2%, Grades 2–4) are depressive disorders, insomnia, and headache. (6.1) Most common adverse drug reactions to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (incidence ≥10%) are diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Studies C209 and C215 – Treatment-Emergent Adverse Drug Reactions: The safety assessment of rilpivirine, used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, is based on the Week 96 pooled data from 1368 subjects in the Phase 3 trials TMC278-C209 (ECHO) and TMC278-C215 (THRIVE) in antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects. A total of 686 subjects received rilpivirine in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as background regimen; most (N=550) received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF as background regimen. The number of subjects randomized to the control arm efavirenz was 682, of which 546 received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF as background regimen [See Clinical Studies (14)]. The median duration of exposure for subjects in either treatment arm was 104 weeks. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) observed at Week 96 in subjects who received rilpivirine or efavirenz plus emtricitabine/tenofovir DF as background regimen are shown in Table 1. No new types of adverse reactions were identified between Week 48 and Week 96. The adverse drug reactions observed in this subset of subjects were generally consistent with those seen for the overall patient population participating in these studies (refer to the prescribing information for EDURANT). The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with rilpivirine or efavirenz + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF due to ADR, regardless of severity, was 2% and 5%, respectively. The most common ADRs leading to discontinuation were psychiatric disorders: 9 (1.6%) subjects in the rilpivirine + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF arm and 12 (2.2%) subjects in the efavirenz + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF arm. Rash led to discontinuation in 1 (0.2%) subjects in the rilpivirine + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF arm and 10 (1.8%) subjects in the efavirenz + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF arm. Common Adverse Drug Reactions Clinical ADRs to rilpivirine or efavirenz of at least moderate intensity (≥ Grade 2) reported in at least 2% of adult subjects are shown in Table 1.

Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: The following adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials of emtricitabine or tenofovir DF in combination with other antiretroviral agents: The most common adverse drug reactions occurred in at least 10% of treatment-naive subjects in a phase 3 clinical trial of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF in combination with another antiretroviral agent are diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. In addition, adverse drug reactions that occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials include abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, fever, pain, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), anxiety, increased cough, and rhinitis. Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown.

Adrenal Function In the pooled Phase 3 trials of C209 and C215, in subjects treated with rilpivirine plus any of the allowed background regimen (N=686), at Week 96, there was an overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol of -19.1 (95% CI: -30.9; -7.4) nmol/L in the rilpivirine group, and of +0.1 (95% CI: -12.6; 12.8) nmol/L in the efavirenz group. At Week 96, the mean change from baseline in ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels was lower in the rilpivirine group (+18.4± 8.36 nmol/L) than in the efavirenz group (+54.1± 7.24 nmol/L). Mean values for both basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol values at Week 96 were within the normal range. Overall, there were no serious adverse events, deaths, or treatment discontinuations that could clearly be attributed to adrenal insufficiency. Effects on adrenal function were comparable by background N(t)RTIs. Serum Creatinine In the pooled Phase 3 trials of C209 and C215 trials in subjects treated with rilpivirine plus any of the allowed background regimen (N=686), there was a small increase in serum creatinine over 96 weeks of treatment with rilpivirine. Most of this increase occurred within the first four weeks of treatment with a mean change of 0.1 mg/dL (range: -0.3 mg/dL to 0.6 mg/dL) observed through Week 96. In subjects who entered the trial with mild or moderate renal impairment, the serum creatinine increase observed was similar to that seen in subjects with normal renal function. These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant and no subject discontinued treatment due to increases in serum creatinine. Creatinine increases were comparable by background N(t)RTIs. Serum Lipids Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides are presented in Table 3.

The same increase was also observed in the efavirenz arm. The pharmacokinetic exposure of rilpivirine in coinfected subjects was comparable to that in subjects without coinfection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of emtricitabine or tenofovir DF. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Rilpivirine: Renal and Urinary Disorders nephrotic syndrome Emtricitabine: No postmarketing adverse reactions have been identified for inclusion in this section. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Immune System Disorders allergic reaction, including angioedema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders pancreatitis, increased amylase, abdominal pain Hepatobiliary Disorders hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes (most commonly AST, ALT gamma GT) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders rash Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and which may contribute to fractures), muscular weakness, myopathy Renal and Urinary Disorders acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, interstitial nephritis (including acute cases), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal insufficiency, increased creatinine, proteinuria, polyuria General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions asthenia The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, hypophosphatemia."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CrCl) before initiating treatment with COMPLERA. Monitor CrCl and serum phosphorus in patients at risk. Avoid administering COMPLERA with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Caution should be given to prescribing COMPLERA with drugs that may reduce the exposure of rilpivirine. (5.4) Caution should be given to prescribing COMPLERA with drugs with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. (5.4) Depressive disorders: Severe depressive disorders have been reported. Immediate medical evaluation is recommended for severe depressive disorders. (5.5) Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a rilpivirine-containing regimen. Monitor serum liver biochemistries before and during treatment with COMPLERA in patients with underlying hepatic disease or marked elevations in serum liver biochemistries. Also consider monitoring serum liver biochemistries in patients without risk factors. (5.6) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.7) Coadministration with other products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine, rilpivirine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, EDURANT, EMTRIVA, STRIBILD, TRUVADA, VIREAD, or with drugs containing lamivudine. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.8) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.9) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.10) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir DF, a component of COMPLERA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with COMPLERA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus before initiating antiretroviral therapy. COMPLERA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of COMPLERA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of COMPLERA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA®, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with COMPLERA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. It is recommended that creatinine clearance be calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with COMPLERA. Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in patients at risk for renal impairment, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA®. COMPLERA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney; however, rilpivirine is not. Since COMPLERA is a combination product and the dose of the individual components cannot be altered, patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL per minute should not receive COMPLERA. 5.4 Drug Interactions Caution should be given to prescribing COMPLERA with drugs that may reduce the exposure of rilpivirine [See Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram [See Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. COMPLERA should be used with caution when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. 5.5 Depressive Disorders The adverse reaction depressive disorders (depressed mood, depression, dysphoria, major depression, mood altered, negative thoughts, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation) has been reported with rilpivirine. During the Phase 3 trials (N=1368) through 96 weeks, the incidence of depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) reported among rilpivirine (N=686) or efavirenz (N=682) was 9% and 8%, respectively. Most events were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 depressive disorders (regardless of causality) was 1% for both rilpivirine and efavirenz. The incidence of discontinuation due to depressive disorders among rilpivirine or efavirenz was 1% in each arm. Suicidal ideation was reported in 4 subjects in each arm while suicide attempt was reported in 2 subjects in the rilpivirine arm. Patients with severe depressive symptoms should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms are related to COMPLERA, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits. 5.6 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a rilpivirine containing regimen. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C, or marked elevations in serum liver biochemistries prior to treatment may be at increased risk for worsening or development of serum liver biochemistries elevations with use of COMPLERA. A few cases of hepatic toxicity have been reported in patients receiving a rilpivirine containing regimen who had no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with COMPLERA is recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C, or in patients with marked elevations in serum liver biochemistries prior to treatment initiation. Serum liver biochemistries monitoring should also be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. 5.7 Decreases in Bone Mineral Density Bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring should be considered for HIV-1 infected patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and Vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a 144 week study of HIV-1 infected treatment-naive adult subjects treated with tenofovir DF (Study 903), decreases in BMD were seen at the lumbar spine and hip in both arms of the study. At Week 144, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving tenofovir DF + lamivudine + efavirenz (-2.2% ± 3.9) compared with subjects receiving stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz (-1.0% ± 4.6). Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups (-2.8% ± 3.5 in the tenofovir DF group vs. -2.4% ± 4.5 in the stavudine group). In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24–48 weeks of the study and this reduction was sustained through 144 weeks. Twenty-eight percent of tenofovir DF-treated subjects vs. 21% of the comparator subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the tenofovir DF group and 6 subjects in the comparator group. Tenofovir DF was associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C telopeptide, and urinary N telopeptide), suggesting increased bone turnover. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. For additional information, please consult the VIREAD® prescribing information. Cases of osteomalacia (associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and which may contribute to fractures) have been reported in association with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.8 Coadministration with Other Products COMPLERA should not be administered concurrently with other medicinal products containing any of the same active components, emtricitabine, rilpivirine, or tenofovir DF (ATRIPLA®, Edurant®, EMTRIVA, STRIBILD™, TRUVADA®, VIREAD), with medicinal products containing lamivudine (Epivir®, Epivir-HBV®, Epzicom®, Combivir®, Trizivir®), or with adefovir dipivoxil (HEPSERA). 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.10 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including the components of COMPLERA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction trials have been conducted using TRUVADA tablets. Drug interaction trials have been conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the components of TRUVADA. This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions observed with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Didanosine: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations. Use with caution and monitor for evidence of didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis, neuropathy) when coadministered. Consider dose reductions or discontinuations of didanosine if warranted. (7.1) HIV-1 protease inhibitors: Coadministration decreases atazanavir concentrations and increases tenofovir concentrations. When coadministered with TRUVADA, use atazanavir given with ritonavir. Coadministration of TRUVADA with atazanavir and ritonavir, darunavir and ritonavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir increases tenofovir concentrations. Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.2) 7.1 Didanosine Coadministration of TRUVADA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered with didanosine the Cmax and AUC of didanosine increased significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis, and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg when it is coadministered with TRUVADA. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for adult or pediatric patients weighing less than 60 kg. When coadministered, TRUVADA and Videx EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (less than 400 kcal, 20% fat). 7.2 HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors Tenofovir decreases the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When coadministered with TRUVADA, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. TRUVADA should not be coadministered with atazanavir without ritonavir. Lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir, and darunavir coadministered with ritonavir have been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters. When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is co-administered with an inhibitor of these transporters, an increase in absorption may be observed. Patients receiving TRUVADA concomitantly with lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, or ritonavir-boosted darunavir should be monitored for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated adverse reactions. 7.3 Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and HARVONI® (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In patients receiving TRUVADA concomitantly with HARVONI without an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/ritonavir or an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/cobicistat combination, monitor for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In patients receiving TRUVADA concomitantly with HARVONI and an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/ritonavir or an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/cobicistat combination, consider an alternative HCV or antiretroviral therapy, as the safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in this setting has not been established. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No drug-drug interactions due to competition for renal excretion have been observed; however, coadministration of TRUVADA with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or the coadministered drug. Some examples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine and/or tenofovir."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe Acute Exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. In HIV-1 infected patients, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) are diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. (6.1) In HIV-1 uninfected individuals in PrEP trials, adverse reactions that were reported by more than 2% of TRUVADA subjects and more frequently than by placebo subjects were headache, abdominal pain and weight decreased. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-445-3235 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in HIV-1 Infected Subjects Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934, an active-controlled clinical trial of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. See also Table 3 for the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse reactions (Grades 2–4) occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects treated in any treatment group in this trial. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles, was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Study 934 - Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions: In Study 934, 511 antiretroviral-naïve subjects received either VIREAD + EMTRIVA administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254) for 144 weeks. Subjects had a mean age of 40 years (range 20 to 73 years) and were predominantly male (88%). Overall, 65% were White, 17% were Black, and 13% were Hispanic. Adverse reactions observed in this trial were generally consistent with those seen in other trials in treatment-experienced or treatment-naïve subjects receiving VIREAD and/or EMTRIVA (Table 3).

In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above for Study 934, Grades 3–4 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (>2.5 × ULN), increased pancreatic amylase (>2.0 × ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (<40 or >250 mg/dL), and increased serum lipase (>2.0 × ULN) occurred in up to 3% of subjects treated with EMTRIVA or VIREAD with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects Emtricitabine: In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with EMTRIVA in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In pediatric clinical trials (Studies 352 and 321) conducted in 184 HIV-1 infected subjects 2 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with VIREAD were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of VIREAD in adults. Eighty-nine pediatric subjects (2 to less than 12 years of age) received VIREAD in Study 352 for a median exposure of 104 weeks. Of these, 4 subjects discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy. Three of these 4 subjects presented with hypophosphatemia and also had decreases in total body or spine BMD Z score [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. For additional information, consult the VIREAD prescribing information. 6.2 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trial Experience in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Subjects No new adverse reactions to TRUVADA were identified from two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (iPrEx, Partners PrEP), in which 2,830 HIV-1 uninfected adults received TRUVADA once daily for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Subjects were followed for a median of 71 weeks and 87 weeks, respectively. These trials enrolled HIV-negative individuals ranging in age from 18 to 67 years. The iPrEx trial enrolled only men or transgender women of Hispanic/Latino (72%), White (18%), Black (9%) and Asian (5%) race. The Partners PrEP trial enrolled both men (61–64% across treatment groups) and women in Kenya and Uganda. Table 5 provides a list of all adverse events that occurred in 2% or more of subjects in any treatment group in the iPrEx and Partners PrEP trials. Laboratory Abnormalities: Table 6 provides a list of laboratory abnormalities observed in both trials. Six subjects in the TDF-containing arms of the Partners PrEP trial discontinued participation in the study due to an increase in blood creatinine compared with no discontinuations in the placebo group. One subject in the TRUVADA arm of the iPrEx trial discontinued from the study due to an increase in blood creatinine and another due to low phosphorous. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above, Grade 1 proteinuria (1+) occurred in 6% of subjects receiving TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial. Grades 2–3 proteinuria (2–4+) and glycosuria (3+) occurred in less than 1% of subjects treated with TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial and Partners PrEP trial.

In the iPrEx trial, a substudy of 503 subjects found mean changes from baseline in BMD ranging from –0.4% to –1.0% across total hip, spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in the TRUVADA group compared with the placebo group, which returned toward baseline after discontinuation of treatment. Thirteen percent of subjects receiving TRUVADA versus 6% of subjects receiving placebo lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine during treatment. Bone fractures were reported in 1.7% of the TRUVADA group compared with 1.4% in the placebo group. No correlation between BMD and fractures was noted [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The Partners PrEP trial found similar fracture rates between treatment and placebo groups (0.8% and 0.6%, respectively). No BMD evaluations were performed during this trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of VIREAD. No additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of EMTRIVA. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders allergic reaction, including angioedema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders pancreatitis, increased amylase, abdominal pain Hepatobiliary Disorders hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes (most commonly AST, ALT gamma GT) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders rash Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and which may contribute to fractures), muscular weakness, myopathy Renal and Urinary Disorders acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, interstitial nephritis (including acute cases), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal insufficiency, increased creatinine, proteinuria, polyuria General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions asthenia The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, hypophosphatemia."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess estimated creatinine clearance before initiating treatment with TRUVADA. In patients at risk for renal dysfunction, assess estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose and urine protein before initiating treatment with TRUVADA and periodically during treatment. Avoid administering Truvada with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Coadministration with Other Products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, GENVOYA, ODEFSEY, STRIBILD, VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.5) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.7) Triple nucleoside-only regimens: Early virologic failure has been reported in HIV-infected patients. Monitor carefully and consider treatment modification. (5.8) Comprehensive management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1: Use as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy including other prevention measures; strictly adhere to dosing schedule. (5.9) Management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 drug resistance: Prior to initiating TRUVADA for PrEP - if clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm negative HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. While using TRUVADA for PrEP - HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. (5.9) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including VIREAD, a component of TRUVADA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient or uninfected individual with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in HIV-1 infected patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with TRUVADA should be suspended in any patient or uninfected individual who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 HBV Infection It is recommended that all individuals be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating TRUVADA. TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients infected with HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are infected with HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with TRUVADA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. HBV-uninfected individuals should be offered vaccination. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. It is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance be assessed in all individuals prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with TRUVADA. In patients at risk of renal dysfunction, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA®, it is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed prior to initiation of TRUVADA, and periodically during TRUVADA therapy. TRUVADA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF). Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients. Treatment of HIV-1 Infection Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with estimated creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received TRUVADA using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of TRUVADA therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. TRUVADA should not be administered to patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis TRUVADA for a PrEP indication should not be used if estimated creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance is observed in uninfected individuals while using TRUVADA for PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.4 Coadministration with Other Products TRUVADA is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Do not coadminister TRUVADA with other drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or containing tenofovir alafenamide, including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, GENVOYA, ODEFSEY, STRIBILD, or VIREAD. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, do not coadminister TRUVADA with other drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Dutrebis (lamivudine/raltegravir), Epivir or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), Triumeq (abacavir sulfate/dolutegravir/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister TRUVADA with HEPSERA (adefovir dipivoxil). 5.5 Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF Bone Mineral Density: In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults and in a clinical trial of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, tenofovir DF was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and VIREAD prescribing information]. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. Clinical trials evaluating tenofovir DF in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the tenofovir DF treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in chronic hepatitis B infected adolescent subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. For more information, consult the VIREAD prescribing information. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects: Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in HIV-1 infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TRUVADA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Early Virologic Failure Clinical trials in HIV-1 infected subjects have demonstrated that certain regimens that only contain three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are generally less effective than triple drug regimens containing two NRTIs in combination with either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. In particular, early virologic failure and high rates of resistance substitutions have been reported. Triple nucleoside regimens should therefore be used with caution. Patients on a therapy utilizing a triple nucleoside-only regimen should be carefully monitored and considered for treatment modification. 5.9 Comprehensive Management to Reduce the Risk of Acquiring HIV-1 Use TRUVADA for pre-exposure prophylaxis only as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes other prevention measures, such as safer sex practices, because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1 [see Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3)]. Counsel uninfected individuals about safer sex practices that include consistent and correct use of condoms, knowledge of their HIV-1 status and that of their partner(s), and regular testing for other sexually transmitted infections that can facilitate HIV-1 transmission (such as syphilis and gonorrhea). Inform uninfected individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior. Use TRUVADA to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 only in individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only TRUVADA, because TRUVADA alone does not constitute a complete treatment regimen for HIV-1 treatment [see Microbiology (12.4)]; therefore, care should be taken to minimize drug exposure in HIV-infected individuals. Many HIV-1 tests, such as rapid tests, detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, evaluate seronegative individuals for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute viral infections (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash, etc.) and ask about potential exposure events (e.g., unprotected, or condom broke during sex with an HIV-1 infected partner) that may have occurred within the last month. If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. While using TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. If symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, PrEP should be discontinued until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. Counsel uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the recommended TRUVADA dosing schedule. The effectiveness of TRUVADA in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions with ATRIPLA. Drug interaction trials are described elsewhere in the labeling [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Efavirenz: Coadministration of efavirenz can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of efavirenz. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered before and during therapy. (4.2, 7.1, 12.3) Didanosine: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations. Use with caution and monitor for evidence of didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis, neuropathy) when coadministered. Consider dose reductions or discontinuations of didanosine if warranted. (7.2) Atazanavir: Coadministration of ATRIPLA and atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir is not recommended. (7.3) Lopinavir/ritonavir: Coadministration increases tenofovir concentrations. Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.3) 7.1 Efavirenz Efavirenz has been shown in vivo to induce CYP3A and CYP2B6. Other compounds that are substrates of CYP3A or CYP2B6 may have decreased plasma concentrations when coadministered with efavirenz. In vitro studies have demonstrated that efavirenz inhibits CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 isozymes in the range of observed efavirenz plasma concentrations. Coadministration of efavirenz with drugs primarily metabolized by these isozymes may result in altered plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug. Therefore, appropriate dose adjustments may be necessary for these drugs. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity (e.g., phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin) would be expected to increase the clearance of efavirenz resulting in lowered plasma concentrations [See Dosage and Administration (2)]. 7.2 Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys, coadministration of ATRIPLA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, and valganciclovir. Coadministration of tenofovir DF and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions [for didanosine dosing adjustment recommendations, see Table 4]. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir with ATRIPLA should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions [See Table 4]. Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended since coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF has been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of atazanavir. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA [See Table 4]. 7.3 Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Other important drug interaction information for ATRIPLA is summarized in Table 1 and Table 4. The drug interactions described are based on trials conducted with efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir DF as individual agents or are potential drug interactions; no drug interaction trials have been conducted using ATRIPLA [for pharmacokinetics data see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Tables 5–9]. The tables include potentially significant interactions, but are not all inclusive. Table 4 Established and Other Potentially SignificantThis table is not all inclusive. Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Trials or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect Clinical Comment Antiretroviral agents Protease inhibitor: atazanavir ↓atazanavir concentration ↑ tenofovir concentration Coadministration of atazanavir with ATRIPLA is not recommended. Coadministration of atazanavir with either efavirenz or tenofovir DF decreases plasma concentrations of atazanavir. The combined effect of efavirenz plus tenofovir DF on atazanavir plasma concentrations is not known. Also, atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations. There are insufficient data to support dosing recommendations for atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with ATRIPLA. Protease inhibitor: fosamprenavir calcium ↓ amprenavir concentration Fosamprenavir (unboosted): Appropriate doses of fosamprenavir and ATRIPLA with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. Fosamprenavir/ritonavir: An additional 100 mg/day (300 mg total) of ritonavir is recommended when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily. No change in the ritonavir dose is required when ATRIPLA is administered with fosamprenavir plus ritonavir twice daily. Protease inhibitor: indinavir ↓ indinavir concentration The optimal dose of indinavir, when given in combination with efavirenz, is not known. Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased indinavir metabolism due to efavirenz. Protease inhibitor: lopinavir/ritonavir ↓ lopinavir concentration ↑ tenofovir concentration A dose increase of lopinavir/ritonavir to 600/150 mg (3 tablets) twice daily may be considered when used in combination with efavirenz in treatment-experienced patients where decreased susceptibility to lopinavir is clinically suspected (by treatment history or laboratory evidence). Patients should be monitored for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Protease inhibitor: ritonavir ↑ ritonavir concentration ↑ efavirenz concentration When ritonavir 500 mg every 12 hours was coadministered with efavirenz 600 mg once daily, the combination was associated with a higher frequency of adverse clinical experiences (e.g., dizziness, nausea, paresthesia) and laboratory abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes). Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when ATRIPLA is used in combination with ritonavir. Protease inhibitor: saquinavir ↓ saquinavir concentration Should not be used as sole protease inhibitor in combination with ATRIPLA. CCR5 co-receptor antagonist: maraviroc ↓ maraviroc concentration Efavirenz decreases plasma concentrations of maraviroc. Refer to the full prescribing information for maraviroc for guidance on coadministration with ATRIPLA. NRTI: didanosine ↑ didanosine concentration Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis and neuropathy. In patients weighing >60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg if coadministered with ATRIPLA. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for patients weighing <60 kg. Coadministration of ATRIPLA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. For additional information, please consult the Videx / Videx EC (didanosine) prescribing information. Other agents Anticoagulant: warfarin ↑ or ↓ warfarin concentration Plasma concentrations and effects potentially increased or decreased by efavirenz. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine ↓ carbamazepine concentration ↓ efavirenz concentration There are insufficient data to make a dose recommendation for ATRIPLA. Alternative anticonvulsant treatment should be used. phenytoin phenobarbital ↓ anticonvulsant concentration ↓ efavirenz concentration Potential for reduction in anticonvulsant and/or efavirenz plasma levels; periodic monitoring of anticonvulsant plasma levels should be conducted. Antidepressants: bupropion ↓ buproprion concentration The effect of efavirenz on bupropion exposure is thought to be due to the induction of bupropion metabolism. Increases in bupropion dosage should be guided by clinical response, but the maximum recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded. sertraline ↓ sertraline concentration Increases in sertraline dose should be guided by clinical response. Antifungals: itraconazole ↓ itraconazole concentration ↓ hydroxy-itraconazole concentration Since no dose recommendation for itraconazole can be made, alternative antifungal treatment should be considered. ketoconazole ↓ ketoconazole concentration Drug interaction trials with ATRIPLA and ketoconazole have not been conducted. Efavirenz has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of ketoconazole. posaconazole ↓ posaconazole concentration Avoid concomitant use unless the benefit outweighs the risks. Anti-infective: clarithromycin ↓ clarithromycin concentration ↑ 14-OH metabolite concentration Clinical significance unknown. In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving efavirenz and clarithromycin. No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is recommended when given with clarithromycin. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. Other macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, have not been studied in combination with ATRIPLA. Antimycobacterial: rifabutin ↓ rifabutin concentration Increase daily dose of rifabutin by 50%. Consider doubling the rifabutin dose in regimens where rifabutin is given 2 or 3 times a week. Antimycobacterial: rifampin ↓ efavirenz concentration If ATRIPLA is coadministered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an additional 200 mg/day of efavirenz is recommended. Calcium channel blockers: diltiazem ↓ diltiazem concentration ↓ desacetyl diltiazem concentration ↓ N-monodes-methyl diltiazem concentration Diltiazem dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for diltiazem). No dose adjustment of ATRIPLA is necessary when administered with diltiazem. Others (e.g., felodipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil) ↓ calcium channel blocker No data are available on the potential interactions of efavirenz with other calcium channel blockers that are substrates of CYP3A. The potential exists for reduction in plasma concentrations of the calcium channel blocker. Dose adjustments should be guided by clinical response (refer to the full prescribing information for the calcium channel blocker). HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: atorvastatin pravastatin simvastatin ↓ atorvastatin concentration ↓ pravastatin concentration ↓ simvastatin concentration Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin decreased with efavirenz. Consult the full prescribing information for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for guidance on individualizing the dose. Hormonal contraceptives: Oral: ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate ↓ active metabolites of norgestimate A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. Efavirenz had no effect on ethinyl estradiol concentrations, but progestin levels (norelgestromin and levonorgestrel) were markedly decreased. No effect of ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate on efavirenz plasma concentrations was observed. Implant: etonogestrel ↓ etonogestrel A reliable method of barrier contraception must be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. The interaction between etonogestrel and efavirenz has not been studied. Decreased exposure of etonogestrel may be expected. There have been postmarketing reports of contraceptive failure with etonogestrel in efavirenz-exposed patients. Immunosuppressants: cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and others metabolized by CYP3A ↓ immuno-suppressant Decreased exposure of the immunosuppressant may be expected due to CYP3A induction by efavirenz. These immunosuppressants are not anticipated to affect exposure of efavirenz. Dose adjustments of the immunosuppressant may be required. Close monitoring of immunosuppressant concentrations for at least 2 weeks (until stable concentrations are reached) is recommended when starting or stopping treatment with ATRIPLA. Narcotic analgesic: methadone ↓ methadone concentration Coadministration of efavirenz in HIV-1 infected individuals with a history of injection drug use resulted in decreased plasma levels of methadone and signs of opiate withdrawal. Methadone dose was increased by a mean of 22% to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be monitored for signs of withdrawal and their methadone dose increased as required to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. 7.4 Efavirenz Assay Interference Cannabinoid Test Interaction: Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have been observed in non-HIV-infected volunteers receiving efavirenz when the Microgenics Cedia DAU Multi-Level THC assay was used for screening. Negative results were obtained when more specific confirmatory testing was performed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects Study 934 Study 934 was an open-label active-controlled trial in which 511 antiretroviral-naive subjects received either emtricitabine + tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254). The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934 include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. Adverse reactions observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials of the individual components (Table 2). Table 2 Selected Treatment-Emergent Adverse ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug. (Grades 2–4) Reported in ≥5% in Either Treatment Group in Study 934 (0–144 Weeks) FTC + TDF + EFVFrom Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine + tenofovir DF with efavirenz. AZT/3TC + EFV N=257 N=254 Gastrointestinal Disorder Diarrhea 9% 5% Nausea 9% 7% Vomiting 2% 5% General Disorders and Administration Site Condition Fatigue 9% 8% Infections and Infestations Sinusitis 8% 4% Upper respiratory tract infections 8% 5% Nasopharyngitis 5% 3% Nervous System Disorders Headache 6% 5% Dizziness 8% 7% Psychiatric Disorders Anxiety 5% 4% Depression 9% 7% Insomnia 5% 7% Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash EventRash event includes rash, exfoliative rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash pruritic, and rash vesicular. 7% 9% Study 073 In Study 073, subjects with stable, virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy and no history of virologic failure were randomized to receive ATRIPLA or to stay on their baseline regimen. The adverse reactions observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those seen in Study 934 and those seen with the individual components of ATRIPLA when each was administered in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, or Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate In addition to the adverse reactions in Study 934 and Study 073 the following adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Efavirenz: The most significant adverse reactions observed in subjects treated with efavirenz are nervous system symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], psychiatric symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], and rash [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Selected adverse reactions of moderate-severe intensity observed in greater than or equal to 2% of efavirenz-treated subjects in two controlled clinical trials included pain, impaired concentration, abnormal dreams, somnolence, anorexia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nervousness, and pruritus. Pancreatitis has also been reported, although a causal relationship with efavirenz has not been established. Asymptomatic increases in serum amylase levels were observed in a significantly higher number of subjects treated with efavirenz 600 mg than in control subjects. Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials include arthralgia, increased cough, dyspepsia, fever, myalgia, pain, abdominal pain, back pain, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), pneumonia, rhinitis and rash event (including rash, pruritus, maculopapular rash, urticaria, vesiculobullous rash, pustular rash and allergic reaction). Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects Efavirenz: In a pediatric clinical trial in 57 NRTI-experienced subjects aged 3 to 16 years, the type and frequency of adverse experiences was generally similar to that of adult subjects with the exception of a higher incidence of rash, which was reported in 46% (26/57) of pediatric subjects compared to 26% of adults, and a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 rash reported in 5% (3/57) of pediatric subjects compared to 0.9% of adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. For additional information, please consult the SUSTIVA prescribing information. Emtricitabine: In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with emtricitabine in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, please consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a pediatric clinical trial conducted in subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with tenofovir DF were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of tenofovir DF in adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. 6.2 Laboratory Abnormalities Efavirenz, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Laboratory abnormalities observed in Study 934 were generally consistent with those seen in previous trials (Table 3). Table 3 Significant Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in ≥1% of Subjects in Either Treatment Group in Study 934 (0–144 Weeks) FTC + TDF + EFVFrom Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF administered in combination with efavirenz in place of emtricitabine + tenofovir DF with efavirenz. AZT/3TC + EFV N=257 N=254 Any ≥ Grade 3 Laboratory Abnormality 30% 26% Fasting Cholesterol (>240 mg/dL) 22% 24% Creatine Kinase (M: >990 U/L) (F: >845 U/L) 9% 7% Serum Amylase (>175 U/L) 8% 4% Alkaline Phosphatase (>550 U/L) 1% 0% AST (M: >180 U/L) (F: >170 U/L) 3% 3% ALT (M: >215 U/L) (F: >170 U/L) 2% 3% Hemoglobin (<8.0 mg/dL) 0% 4% Hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL) 2% 1% Hematuria (>75 RBC/HPF) 3% 2% Glycosuria (≥3+) <1% 1% Neutrophils (<750/mm3) 3% 5% Fasting Triglycerides (>750 mg/dL) 4% 2% Laboratory abnormalities observed in Study 073 were generally consistent with those in Study 934. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described for Study 934 (Table 3), Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (greater than 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)), increased pancreatic amylase (greater than 2.0 × ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (less than 40 or greater than 250 mg/dL), and increased serum lipase (greater than 2.0 × ULN) occurred in up to 3% of subjects treated with emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Hepatic Events: In Study 934, 19 subjects treated with efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF and 20 subjects treated with efavirenz and fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine were hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody positive. Among these coinfected subjects, one subject (1/19) in the efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir DF arm had elevations in transaminases to greater than five times ULN through 144 weeks. In the fixed-dose zidovudine/lamivudine arm, two subjects (2/20) had elevations in transaminases to greater than five times ULN through 144 weeks. No HBV and/or HCV coinfected subject discontinued from the trial due to hepatobiliary disorders [See Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of efavirenz, emtricitabine, or tenofovir DF. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Efavirenz: Cardiac Disorders Palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Tinnitus, vertigo Endocrine Disorders Gynecomastia Eye Disorders Abnormal vision Gastrointestinal Disorders Constipation, malabsorption General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Asthenia Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatic enzyme increase, hepatic failure, hepatitis. A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, were characterized by a fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death. Immune System Disorders Allergic reactions Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [See Warnings and Precautions (5.14)], hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia, myalgia, myopathy Nervous System Disorders Abnormal coordination, ataxia, cerebellar coordination and balance disturbances, convulsions, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, neuropathy, tremor Psychiatric Disorders Aggressive reactions, agitation, delusions, emotional lability, mania, neurosis, paranoia, psychosis, suicide Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Flushing, erythema multiforme, photoallergic dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome Emtricitabine: No postmarketing adverse reactions have been identified for inclusion in this section.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious psychiatric symptoms: Immediate medical evaluation is recommended. (5.5, 6.1) Nervous system symptoms (NSS): NSS are frequent, usually begin 1–2 days after initiating therapy and resolve in 2–4 weeks. Dosing at bedtime may improve tolerability. NSS are not predictive of onset of psychiatric symptoms. (2, 5.6) New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CrCl) before initiating treatment with ATRIPLA. Monitor CrCl and serum phosphorus in patients at risk. Avoid administering ATRIPLA with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.7) Pregnancy: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. A pregnancy registry is available. (5.8, 8.1) Rash: Discontinue if severe rash develops. (5.9, 6.1) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment in patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C coinfection, marked transaminase elevations, or who are taking medications associated with liver toxicity. Among reported cases of hepatic failure, a few occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease. (5.10, 6.3, 8.6) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathological fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.11) Convulsions: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures. (5.12) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.13) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.14) Coadministration with other products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, or VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. SUSTIVA (efavirenz) should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless required for dose-adjustment when coadministered with rifampin. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs including tenofovir DF, a component of ATRIPLA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with ATRIPLA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic HBV before initiating antiretroviral therapy. ATRIPLA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, and the safety and efficacy of ATRIPLA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of ATRIPLA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with emtricitabine, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow up for at least several months after stopping treatment with ATRIPLA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. ATRIPLA should not be administered with HEPSERA® (adefovir dipivoxil) [See Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.3 Drug Interactions Efavirenz plasma concentrations may be altered by substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A. Likewise, efavirenz may alter plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2B6 [See Contraindications (4.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.4 Coadministration with Related Products Related drugs not for coadministration with ATRIPLA include COMPLERA (emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir DF), EMTRIVA (emtricitabine), TRUVADA (emtricitabine/tenofovir DF), and VIREAD (tenofovir DF), which contain the same active components as ATRIPLA. SUSTIVA (efavirenz) should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA unless needed for dose-adjustment (e.g. with rifampin) [See Dosage and Administration (2), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, ATRIPLA should not be coadministered with drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir, or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). 5.5 Psychiatric Symptoms Serious psychiatric adverse experiences have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. In controlled trials of 1008 subjects treated with regimens containing efavirenz for a mean of 2.1 years and 635 subjects treated with control regimens for a mean of 1.5 years, the frequency (regardless of causality) of specific serious psychiatric events among subjects who received efavirenz or control regimens, respectively, were: severe depression (2.4%, 0.9%), suicidal ideation (0.7%, 0.3%), nonfatal suicide attempts (0.5%, 0%), aggressive behavior (0.4%, 0.5%), paranoid reactions (0.4%, 0.3%), and manic reactions (0.2%, 0.3%). When psychiatric symptoms similar to those noted above were combined and evaluated as a group in a multifactorial analysis of data from Study AI266006 (006), treatment with efavirenz was associated with an increase in the occurrence of these selected psychiatric symptoms. Other factors associated with an increase in the occurrence of these psychiatric symptoms were history of injection drug use, psychiatric history, and receipt of psychiatric medication at trial entry; similar associations were observed in both the efavirenz and control treatment groups. In Study 006, onset of new serious psychiatric symptoms occurred throughout the trial for both efavirenz-treated and control-treated subjects. One percent of efavirenz-treated subjects discontinued or interrupted treatment because of one or more of these selected psychiatric symptoms. There have also been occasional postmarketing reports of death by suicide, delusions, and psychosis-like behavior, although a causal relationship to the use of efavirenz cannot be determined from these reports. Patients with serious psychiatric adverse experiences should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits [See Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.6 Nervous System Symptoms Fifty-three percent (531/1008) of subjects receiving efavirenz in controlled trials reported central nervous system symptoms (any grade, regardless of causality) compared to 25% (156/635) of subjects receiving control regimens. These symptoms included dizziness (28.1% of the 1008 subjects), insomnia (16.3%), impaired concentration (8.3%), somnolence (7.0%), abnormal dreams (6.2%), and hallucinations (1.2%). Other reported symptoms were euphoria, confusion, agitation, amnesia, stupor, abnormal thinking, and depersonalization. The majority of these symptoms were mild-moderate (50.7%); symptoms were severe in 2.0% of subjects. Overall, 2.1% of subjects discontinued therapy as a result. These symptoms usually begin during the first or second day of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2–4 weeks of therapy. After 4 weeks of therapy, the prevalence of nervous system symptoms of at least moderate severity ranged from 5% to 9% in subjects treated with regimens containing efavirenz and from 3% to 5% in subjects treated with a control regimen. Patients should be informed that these common symptoms were likely to improve with continued therapy and were not predictive of subsequent onset of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of these nervous system symptoms [See Dosage and Administration (2)]. Analysis of long-term data from Study 006, (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for subjects treated with efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among efavirenz-treated subjects were generally similar to those in the indinavir-containing control arm. Patients receiving ATRIPLA should be alerted to the potential for additive central nervous system effects when ATRIPLA is used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms such as dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or drowsiness should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. 5.7 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney; however, efavirenz is not. Since ATRIPLA is a combination product and the dose of the individual components cannot be altered, patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min should not receive ATRIPLA. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. It is recommended that creatinine clearance be calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with ATRIPLA. Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in patients at risk for renal impairment, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA. ATRIPLA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. 5.8 Reproductive Risk Potential Pregnancy Category D: Efavirenz may cause fetal harm when administered during the first trimester to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving ATRIPLA. Barrier contraception must always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (e.g., oral or other hormonal contraceptives). Because of the long half-life of efavirenz, use of adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of ATRIPLA is recommended. Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of ATRIPLA. If this drug is used during the first trimester of pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of ATRIPLA in pregnant women. ATRIPLA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus, such as in pregnant women without other therapeutic options [See Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.9 Rash In controlled clinical trials, 26% (266/1008) of subjects treated with 600 mg efavirenz experienced new-onset skin rash compared with 17% (111/635) of subjects treated in control groups. Rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation, or ulceration occurred in 0.9% (9/1008) of subjects treated with efavirenz. The incidence of Grade 4 rash (e.g., erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in subjects treated with efavirenz in all trials and expanded access was 0.1%. Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 2 weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz (median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days) and, in most subjects continuing therapy with efavirenz, rash resolves within 1 month (median duration, 16 days). The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was 1.7% (17/1008). ATRIPLA can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. ATRIPLA should be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement, or fever. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. Experience with efavirenz in subjects who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited. Nineteen subjects who discontinued nevirapine because of rash have been treated with efavirenz. Nine of these subjects developed mild-to-moderate rash while receiving therapy with efavirenz, and two of these subjects discontinued because of rash. Rash was reported in 26 of 57 pediatric subjects (46%) treated with efavirenz [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. One pediatric subject experienced Grade 3 rash (confluent rash with fever), and two subjects had Grade 4 rash (erythema multiforme). The median time to onset of rash in pediatric subjects was 8 days. Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines before initiating therapy with ATRIPLA in pediatric patients should be considered. 5.10 Hepatotoxicity Monitoring of liver enzymes before and during treatment is recommended for patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B or C infection; patients with marked transaminase elevations; and patients treated with other medications associated with liver toxicity [See also Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. A few of the postmarketing reports of hepatic failure occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Liver enzyme monitoring should also be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. In patients with persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range, the benefit of continued therapy with ATRIPLA needs to be weighed against the unknown risks of significant liver toxicity [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.11 Decreases in Bone Mineral Density Assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) should be considered for patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. In a 144-week trial of treatment-naive adult subjects receiving tenofovir DF, decreases in BMD were seen at the lumbar spine and hip in both arms of the trial. At Week 144, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving tenofovir DF + lamivudine + efavirenz compared with subjects receiving stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz. Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups. In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24–48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through 144 weeks. Twenty-eight percent of tenofovir DF-treated subjects vs. 21% of the comparator subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the tenofovir DF group and 6 subjects in the comparator group. Tenofovir DF was associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C-telopeptide, and urinary N-telopeptide), suggesting increased bone turnover. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. In a clinical trial of HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older (Study 321), bone effects were similar to adult subjects. Under normal circumstances BMD increases rapidly in this age group. In this trial, the mean rate of bone gain was less in the tenofovir DF-treated group compared to the placebo group. Six tenofovir DF-treated subjects and one placebo-treated subject had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at 48 weeks. Among 28 subjects receiving 96 weeks of tenofovir DF, Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. Skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. Markers of bone turnover in tenofovir DF-treated pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older suggest increased bone turnover, consistent with the effects observed in adults. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. For additional information, consult the VIREAD prescribing information. Cases of osteomalacia (associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and which may contribute to fractures) have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.12 Convulsions Convulsions have been observed in patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of known medical history of seizures. Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medications primarily metabolized by the liver, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels [See Drug Interactions (7.3)]. 5.13 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including the components of ATRIPLA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.14 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See also Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3). STRIBILD is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, STRIBILD should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. (5.4, 7.1) STRIBILD can alter the concentration of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A can alter the concentrations of one or more components of STRIBILD. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug-drug interactions. (4, 7.2, 7.3, 12.3) 7.1 Other Antiretroviral Medications STRIBILD is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, STRIBILD should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Complete information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided. 7.2 Potential for STRIBILD to Affect Other Drugs Cobicistat, a component of STRIBILD, is an inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of the following transporters: P-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. Thus, coadministration of STRIBILD with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6, or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3, may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs. Elvitegravir is a modest inducer of CYP2C9 and may decrease the plasma concentrations of CYP2C9 substrates. 7.3 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect One or More Components of STRIBILD Elvitegravir and cobicistat, components of STRIBILD, are metabolized by CYP3A. Cobicistat is also metabolized, to a minor extent, by CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity are expected to increase the clearance of elvitegravir and cobicistat, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of cobicistat and elvitegravir, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and development of resistance (See Table 6). Coadministration of STRIBILD with other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the clearance and increase the plasma concentration of cobicistat (See Table 6). 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Because emtricitabine and tenofovir, components of STRIBILD, are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of STRIBILD with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 7.5 Established and Other Potentially Significant Interactions Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either STRIBILD or the components of STRIBILD (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF) as individual agents and/or in combination, or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with STRIBILD [for magnitude of interaction, See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The table includes potentially significant interactions but is not all inclusive. Table 6 Established and Other Potentially SignificantThis table is not all inclusive. Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration ↑=Increase, ↓=Decrease, ⇔=No Effect Clinical Comment Acid Reducing Agents: AntacidsIndicates that a drug-drug interaction trial was conducted. e.g., aluminum and magnesium hydroxide ↓ elvitegravir Separate STRIBILD and antacid administration by at least 2 hours. Antiarrhythmics: e.g., amiodarone bepridil digoxin disopyramide flecainide systemic lidocaine mexiletine propafenone quinidine ↑ antiarrhythmics ↑ digoxin Therapeutic concentration monitoring, if available, is recommended for antiarrhythmics when coadministered with STRIBILD. Antibacterials: clarithromycin ↑ clarithromycin ↑ cobicistat Patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute: No dose adjustment of clarithromycin is required. Patients with CLcr between 50 mL/minute and 60 mL/minute: The dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%. Anticoagulants: warfarin Effect on warfarin unknown Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) upon coadministration of warfarin with STRIBILD. Anticonvulsants: oxcarbazepine ↓ elvitegravir ↓ cobicistat Alternative anticonvulsants should be considered when STRIBILD is coadministered with oxcarbazepine. clonazepam ethosuximide ↑ clonazepam ↑ ethosuximide Clinical monitoring is recommended upon coadministration of clonazepam or ethosuximide with STRIBILD. Antidepressants: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) e.g., paroxetine Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) e.g., amitriptyline desipramine imipramine nortriptyline bupropion trazodone ↑ SSRIs ↑ TCAs ↑ trazodone Careful dose titration of the antidepressant and monitoring for antidepressant response are recommended when coadministered with STRIBILD. Antifungals: itraconazole ketoconazole voriconazole ↑ elvitegravir ↑ cobicistat ↑ itraconazole ↑ ketoconazole ↑ voriconazole When coadministered with STRIBILD, the maximum daily dose of ketoconazole or itraconazole should not exceed 200 mg per day. An assessment of benefit/risk ratio is recommended to justify use of voriconazole with STRIBILD. Anti-gout: colchicine ↑ colchicine STRIBILD is not recommended to be coadministered with colchicine to patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Treatment of gout-flares – coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving STRIBILD: 0.6 mg (1 tablet) × 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Treatment course to be repeated no earlier than 3 days. Prophylaxis of gout-flares – coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving STRIBILD: If the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day. If the original regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day. Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever – coadministration of colchicine in patients receiving STRIBILD: Maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day). Antimycobacterial: rifabutin rifapentine ↓ elvitegravir ↓ cobicistat Coadministration of STRIBILD with rifabutin or rifapentine is not recommended. Antipsychotics: quetiapine ↑ quetiapine Initiation of STRIBILD in patients taking quetiapine: Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposure. If coadministration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring. Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking STRIBILD: Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine. Beta-Blockers: e.g., metoprolol timolol ↑ beta-blockers Clinical monitoring is recommended and a dose decrease of the beta-blocker may be necessary when these agents are coadministered with STRIBILD. Calcium Channel Blockers: e.g., amlodipine diltiazem felodipine nicardipine nifedipine verapamil ↑ calcium channel blockers Clinical monitoring is recommended upon coadministration of calcium channel blockers with STRIBILD. Corticosteroid: Systemic: dexamethasone ↓ elvitegravir ↓ cobicistat Alternative corticosteroids should be considered. Corticosteroid: Inhaled/Nasal: fluticasone ↑ fluticasone Concomitant use of STRIBILD with inhaled or nasal fluticasone may reduce serum cortisol concentrations. Alternative corticosteroids should be considered, particularly for long-term use. Endothelin Receptor Antagonists: bosentan ↑ bosentan Coadministration of bosentan in patients on STRIBILD: In patients who have been receiving STRIBILD for at least 10 days, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability. Coadministration of STRIBILD in patients on bosentan: Discontinue use of bosentan at least 36 hours prior to initiation of STRIBILD. After at least 10 days following the initiation of STRIBILD, resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents: ledipasvir/sofosbuvir ↑ tenofovir The safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in the setting of HARVONI® and STRIBILD has not been established. Coadministration is not recommended. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: atorvastatin ↑ atorvastatin Initiate with the lowest starting dose of atorvastatin and titrate carefully while monitoring for safety. Hormonal Contraceptives: norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol ↑ norgestimate ↓ ethinyl estradiol The effects of increases in the concentration of the progestational component norgestimate are not fully known and can include increased risk of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, acne, and venous thrombosis. The potential risks and benefits associated with coadministration of norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol with STRIBILD should be considered, particularly in women who have risk factors for these events. Coadministration of STRIBILD with other hormonal contraceptives (e.g., contraceptive patch, contraceptive vaginal ring, or injectable contraceptives) or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norgestimate has not been studied; therefore, alternative (nonhormonal) methods of contraception can be considered. Immuno-suppressants: e.g., cyclosporine sirolimus tacrolimus ↑ immuno-suppressants Therapeutic monitoring of the immunosuppressive agents is recommended upon coadministration with STRIBILD. Narcotic Analgesics: buprenorphine/ naloxone ↑ buprenorphine ↑ norbuprenorphine ↓ naloxone Patients should be closely monitored for sedation and cognitive effects. Inhaled Beta Agonist: salmeterol ↑ salmeterol Coadministration of salmeterol and STRIBILD is not recommended because it may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations, and sinus tachycardia. Neuroleptics: e.g., perphenazine risperidone thioridazine ↑ neuroleptics A decrease in dose of the neuroleptic may be needed when coadministered with STRIBILD. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) Inhibitors: sildenafil tadalafil vardenafil ↑ PDE-5 inhibitors Coadministration with STRIBILD may result in an increase in PDE-5 inhibitor associated adverse reactions, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances, and priapism. Use of tadalafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): Coadministration of tadalafil in patients on STRIBILD: In patients receiving STRIBILD for at least 1 week, start tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase tadalafil dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Coadministration of STRIBILD in patients on tadalafil: Avoid use of tadalafil during the initiation of STRIBILD. Stop tadalafil at least 24 hours prior to starting STRIBILD. After at least one week following initiation of STRIBILD, resume tadalafil at 20 mg once daily. Increase tadalafil dose to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction: The below PDE-5 inhibitors can be used along with increased monitoring for PDE-5-inhibitor associated adverse events: Sildenafil at a single dose not exceeding 25 mg in 48 hours, or Tadalafil at a single dose not exceeding 10 mg in 72 hours, or Vardenafil at a single dose not exceeding 2.5 mg in 72 hours Sedative/hypnotics: Benzodiazepines: e.g., parenterally administered midazolam clorazepate diazepam estazolam flurazepam buspirone zolpidem ↑ sedatives/hypnotics Coadministration of parenteral midazolam with STRIBILD should be done in a setting that ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered. With other sedative/hypnotics, dose reduction may be necessary and clinical monitoring is recommended. 7.6 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with STRIBILD Based on drug interaction studies conducted with the components of STRIBILD, no clinically significant drug interactions have been either observed or are expected when STRIBILD is combined with the following drugs: entecavir, famciclovir, H2 receptor antagonists, methadone, proton pump inhibitors, and ribavirin."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B [See Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Most common adverse drug reactions to STRIBILD (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) are nausea and diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In HIV-1-Infected Subjects with No Antiretroviral Treatment History The safety assessment of STRIBILD is based on the Week-144 pooled data from 1408 subjects in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials, Study 102 and Study 103, in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected adult subjects [See Clinical Studies (14)]. A total of 701 subjects received STRIBILD once daily in these two studies. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with STRIBILD, ATRIPLA, or ATV+RTV+TRUVADA due to adverse events, regardless of severity, was 6.0%, 7.4%, and 8.5%, respectively. Table 2 displays the frequency of adverse reactions greater than or equal to 5% of subjects in any treatment arm. Table 2 Adverse ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events attributed to study drugs. (All Grades) Reported in ≥5% of Subjects in Any Treatment Arm in Studies 102 and 103 (Week-144 Analysis) STRIBILD N=701 ATRIPLA N=352 ATV+RTV+ TRUVADA N=355 EYE DISORDERS Ocularicterus <1% 0% 13% GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS Diarrhea 12% 11% 17% Flatulence 2% <1% 8% Nausea 16% 9% 14% GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS Fatigue 4% 8% 6% HEPATOBILIARY DISORDERS Jaundice 0% <1% 9% NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS Somnolence 1% 7% 1% Headache 7% 4% 6% Dizziness 3% 21% 5% PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS Insomnia 3% 9% 1% Abnormal dreams 9% 27% 4% SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE DISORDERS RashRash event includes dermatitis, drug eruption, eczema, pruritus, pruritus generalized, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash morbilliform, rash papular, rash pruritic, and urticaria. 4% 15% 6% See Warnings and Precautions (5.3) for a discussion of renal adverse reactions from clinical trials experience with STRIBILD. Additional adverse reactions observed with STRIBILD included suicidal ideation and suicide attempt (0.3%), all in subjects with a preexisting history of depression or psychiatric illness. In Virologically Suppressed HIV-1-Infected Subjects No new adverse reactions to STRIBILD through Week 48 were identified in 584 virologically stably suppressed subjects switching to STRIBILD from a regimen containing a RTV-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). In a combined analysis of studies 115 and 121, the frequency of adverse reactions (all grades) was 24% in subjects switching to STRIBILD compared to 6% of subjects in either group who stayed on their baseline antiretroviral regimen, RTV-boosted PI+TRUVADA or NNRTI+TRUVADA. Common adverse reactions that occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of subjects switching to STRIBILD were nausea (4%), flatulence (2%), and headache (2%). The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with STRIBILD, the RTV-boosted PI, or the NNRTI due to adverse events was 2%, 3%, and 1%, respectively. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials of the Components of STRIBILD Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In addition to the adverse reactions observed with STRIBILD, the following adverse reactions occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naïve subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: depression, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, fever, pain, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), anxiety, increased cough, and rhinitis. Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Laboratory Abnormalities The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3−4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving STRIBILD in studies 102 and 103 are presented in Table 3. Table 3 Laboratory Abnormalities (Grades 3−4) Reported in ≥2% of Subjects Receiving STRIBILD in Studies 102 and 103 (Week-144 Analysis) Laboratory Parameter AbnormalityFrequencies are based on treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. , For subjects with serum amylase >1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), lipase test was also performed. The frequency of increased lipase (Grades 3−4) occurring in STRIBILD (N=69), ATRIPLA (N=40), and ATV+RTV+TRUVADA (N=38) was 17%, 15%, and 24%, respectively. STRIBILD N=701 ATRIPLA N=352 ATV+RTV+ TRUVADA N=355 AST (>5.0 × ULN) 3% 6% 6% ALT (>3.0 × ULN) 2% 5% 4% Amylase (>2.0 × ULN) 3% 3% 5% Creatine Kinase (≥10.0 × ULN) 8% 15% 11% Urine RBC (Hematuria) (>75 RBC/HPF) 4% 2% 4% In Study 103, BMD was assessed by DEXA in a nonrandom subset of 120 subjects (STRIBILD group, N=54; ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group, N=66). Mean percentage decreases in BMD from baseline to Week 144 in the STRIBILD group were comparable to that in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group at the lumbar spine (−1.43% versus −3.68%, respectively) and at the hip (−2.83% versus −3.77%, respectively). In studies 102 and 103, bone fractures occurred in 27 subjects (3.9%) in the STRIBILD group, 8 subjects (2.3%) in the ATRIPLA group, and 19 subjects (5.4%) in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group. These findings were consistent with data from an earlier 144-week trial of treatment-naïve subjects receiving tenofovir DF + lamivudine + efavirenz. Proteinuria (all grades) occurred in 52% of subjects receiving STRIBILD, 41% of subjects receiving ATRIPLA, and 42% of subjects receiving ATV+RTV+TRUVADA. The cobicistat component of STRIBILD has been shown to increase serum creatinine and decrease estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function. In studies 102 and 103, increases in serum creatinine and decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in treatment with STRIBILD, after which levels stabilized. Table 4 displays the mean changes in serum creatinine and eGFR levels at Week 144 and the percentage of subjects with elevations in serum creatinine (all grades). Table 4 Change from Baseline in Serum Creatinine and eGFR and Incidence of Elevated Serum Creatinine (All Grades) in Studies 102 and 103 at Week 144 STRIBILD N=701 ATRIPLA N=352 ATV+RTV+ TRUVADA N=355 Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)Mean change ± standard deviation 0.14 (±0.14) 0.01 (±0.12) 0.09 (±0.15) eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault (mL/minute) −14.0 (±16.6) −1.9 (±17.9) −9.8 (±19.4) Subjects with Elevations in Serum Creatinine (All Grades) (%) 12 2 6 Emtricitabine or Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In addition to the laboratory abnormalities observed with STRIBILD, the following laboratory abnormalities have been previously reported in subjects treated with emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in other clinical trials: Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities of ALT (M: greater than 215 U per L; F: greater than 170 U per L), alkaline phosphatase (greater than 550 U per L), bilirubin (greater than 2.5 × ULN), serum glucose (less than 40 or greater than 250 mg per dL), glycosuria (greater than or equal to 3+), neutrophils (less than 750 per mm3), fasting cholesterol (greater than 240 mg per dL), and fasting triglycerides (greater than 750 mg per dL). Serum Lipids: In the clinical trials of STRIBILD, a similar percentage of subjects receiving STRIBILD, ATRIPLA, and ATV+RTV+TRUVADA were on lipid-lowering agents at baseline (12%, 12%, and 13%, respectively). While receiving study drug through Week 144, an additional 11% of STRIBILD subjects were started on lipid-lowering agents, compared to 13% of ATRIPLA and 12% of ATV+RTV+TRUVADA subjects. Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides are presented in Table 5. Table 5 Lipid Values, Mean Change from Baseline at Week 144 in Subjects Receiving STRIBILD or Comparator in Studies 102 and 103 STRIBILD N=701 ATRIPLA N=352 ATV+RTV+TRUVADA N=355 Baseline Week 144 Baseline Week 144 Baseline Week 144 mg/dL ChangeThe change from baseline is the mean of within-patient changes from baseline for patients with both baseline and Week 144 values. mg/dL Change mg/dL Change Total Cholesterol (fasted) 166 [N=675] +17 [N=535] 161 [N=343] +22 [N=262] 168 [N=337] +16 [N=243] HDL-cholesterol (fasted) 43 [N=675] +7 [N=535] 43 [N=343] +9 [N=262] 42 [N=335] +7 [N=242] LDL-cholesterol (fasted) 100 [N=675] +15 [N=535] 97 [N=343] +19 [N=262] 101 [N=337] +18 [N=242] Triglycerides (fasted) 122 [N=675] +12 [N=535] 121 [N=343] +5 [N=262] 132 [N=337] +22 [N=242] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tenofovir DF. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. No additional postmarketing adverse reactions specific for emtricitabine have been identified. Immune System Disorders allergic reaction, including angioedema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders pancreatitis, increased amylase, abdominal pain Hepatobiliary Disorders hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes (most commonly AST, ALT, gamma GT) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders rash Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and which may contribute to fractures), muscular weakness, myopathy Renal and Urinary Disorders acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, interstitial nephritis (including acute cases), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal insufficiency, increased creatinine, proteinuria, polyuria General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions asthenia The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, hypophosphatemia."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CLcr), urine glucose, and urine protein before initiating treatment with STRIBILD. Monitor CLcr, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients at risk for renal impairment. Avoid administering STRIBILD with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Avoid coadministration with other antiretroviral products: Do not use with products containing any of the components of STRIBILD (cobicistat, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, TYBOST, VIREAD, or VITEKTA; with drugs containing lamivudine; or with drugs or regimens containing ritonavir. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Risk of adverse reactions or loss of virologic response due to drug interactions: The concomitant use of STRIBILD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and possible development of resistance; and possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. (5.5) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.6) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.8) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with STRIBILD should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic HBV before initiating antiretroviral therapy. STRIBILD is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, and the safety and efficacy of STRIBILD have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of STRIBILD. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA®, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with STRIBILD. If appropriate, initiation of antihepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, and with the use of STRIBILD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In the clinical trials of STRIBILD over 144 weeks, 13 (1.9%) subjects in the STRIBILD group (N=701), 8 (2.3%) subjects in the atazanavir (ATV) + ritonavir (RTV) + TRUVADA® (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg) group (N=355), and no subjects in the ATRIPLA® (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir DF 300 mg) group (N=352) discontinued study drug due to a renal adverse reaction. Of these discontinuations, 8 in the STRIBILD group and 1 in the ATV+RTV+TRUVADA group occurred during the first 48 weeks. Four (0.6%) subjects who received STRIBILD developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, leading to discontinuation of STRIBILD during the first 48 weeks of treatment. Two of the four subjects had renal impairment (i.e., estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 mL per minute) at baseline. The laboratory findings in these 4 subjects improved but did not completely resolve in all subjects upon discontinuation of STRIBILD. Renal replacement therapy was not required for these subjects. One (0.3%) subject who received ATV+RTV+TRUVADA developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, leading to discontinuation of ATV+RTV+TRUVADA after Week 96. STRIBILD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [See Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients. Estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein should be documented in all patients prior to initiating therapy. Initiation of STRIBILD in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute is not recommended. Routine monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein should be performed during STRIBILD therapy in all patients. Additionally, serum phosphorus should be measured in patients at risk for renal impairment. Although cobicistat (a component of STRIBILD) may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)], patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. The emtricitabine and tenofovir DF components of STRIBILD are primarily excreted by the kidney. STRIBILD should be discontinued if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL per minute as dose interval adjustment required for emtricitabine and tenofovir DF cannot be achieved with the fixed-dose combination tablet. 5.4 Avoid Use with Other Antiretroviral Products STRIBILD is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, and coadministration with other antiretroviral products is not recommended. STRIBILD is not recommended for coadministration with the following: cobicistat (TYBOST®) elvitegravir (VITEKTA®) products containing emtricitabine or tenofovir DF (ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, VIREAD®) products containing lamivudine (Combivir, Epivir, Epivir-HBV, Epzicom, Triumeq, Trizivir) adefovir dipivoxil (HEPSERA®) products containing ritonavir (Norvir, Kaletra). 5.5 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of STRIBILD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [See Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.5)]: Loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and possible development of resistance. Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. See Table 6 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [See Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during STRIBILD therapy; review concomitant medications during STRIBILD therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs. 5.6 Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF Bone Mineral Density In clinical trials in HIV-1-infected adults, tenofovir DF (a component of STRIBILD) was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1.25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. For additional information, see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and consult the VIREAD prescribing information. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for HIV-1-infected patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial in all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including STRIBILD. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction trials have been conducted using TRUVADA tablets. Drug interaction trials have been conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the components of TRUVADA. This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions observed with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Didanosine: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations. Use with caution and monitor for evidence of didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis, neuropathy) when coadministered. Consider dose reductions or discontinuations of didanosine if warranted. (7.1) Atazanavir: Coadministration decreases atazanavir concentrations and increases tenofovir concentrations. Use atazanavir with TRUVADA only with ritonavir; monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.2) Lopinavir/ritonavir: Coadministration increases tenofovir concentrations. Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.2) 7.1 Didanosine Coadministration of TRUVADA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered with didanosine the Cmax and AUC of didanosine administered as either the buffered or enteric-coated formulation increased significantly [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis, and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg when it is coadministered with TRUVADA. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for adult or pediatric patients weighing less than 60 kg. When coadministered, TRUVADA and Videx EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (less than 400 kcal, 20% fat). Coadministration of didanosine buffered tablet formulation with TRUVADA should be under fasted conditions. 7.2 Atazanavir Atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving atazanavir and TRUVADA should be monitored for TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir decreases the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When coadministered with TRUVADA, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Atazanavir without ritonavir should not be coadministered with TRUVADA. 7.3 Lopinavir/Ritonavir Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir and TRUVADA should be monitored for TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No drug-drug interactions due to competition for renal excretion have been observed; however, coadministration of TRUVADA with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or the coadministered drug. Some examples include, but are not limited to acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, and valganciclovir. Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine and/or tenofovir."

Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934, an active-controlled clinical trial of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. See also Table 2 for the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse reactions (Grade 2–4) occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects treated with efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in this trial. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Study 934 - Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions: In Study 934, 511 antiretroviral-naive subjects received either VIREAD + EMTRIVA administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254).

In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above for Study 934, Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (>2.5 × ULN), increased pancreatic amylase (>2.0 × ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (<40 or >250 mg/dL), and increased serum lipase (>2.0 × ULN) occurred in up to 3% of subjects treated with EMTRIVA or VIREAD with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older Emtricitabine: In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with EMTRIVA in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, please consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a pediatric clinical trial conducted in subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with VIREAD were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of VIREAD in adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of VIREAD. No additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of EMTRIVA. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CrCl) before initiating treatment with TRUVADA. Monitor CrCl and serum phosphorus in patients at risk. Avoid administering Truvada with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Coadministration with Other Products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, EMTRIVA, VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.5) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.7) Triple nucleoside-only regimens: Early virologic failure has been reported in HIV-infected patients. Monitor carefully and consider treatment modification. (5.8) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including VIREAD, a component of TRUVADA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with TRUVADA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy. TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow up for at least several months after stopping treatment with Truvada. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. It is recommended that creatinine clearance be calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with TRUVADA. Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in patients at risk for renal impairment, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA. Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min, [See Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received TRUVADA using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of TRUVADA therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. TRUVADA should not be administered to patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis. TRUVADA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. 5.4 Coadministration with Other Products TRUVADA is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. TRUVADA should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA, EMTRIVA, or VIREAD. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, TRUVADA should not be coadministered with other drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). TRUVADA should not be administered with HEPSERA® (adefovir dipivoxil). 5.5 Decreases in Bone Mineral Density Assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) should be considered for HIV-1 infected adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a 144-week trial of treatment-naive adult subjects, decreases in BMD were seen at the lumbar spine and hip in both arms of the trial. At Week 144, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving VIREAD + lamivudine + efavirenz compared with subjects receiving stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz. Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups. In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24–48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through 144 weeks. Twenty-eight percent of VIREAD-treated subjects vs. 21% of the comparator subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the VIREAD group and 6 subjects in the comparator group. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C-telopeptide, and urinary N-telopeptide), suggesting increased bone turnover. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving VIREAD. In a clinical trial of HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older (Study 321), bone effects were similar to adult subjects. Under normal circumstances BMD increases rapidly in this age group. In this trial, the mean rate of bone gain was less in the VIREAD-treated group compared to the placebo group. Six VIREAD treated subjects and one placebo treated subject had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss in 48 weeks. Among 28 subjects receiving 96 weeks of VIREAD, Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. Skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. Markers of bone turnover in VIREAD-treated pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older suggest increased bone turnover, consistent with the effects observed in adults. The effects of VIREAD-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. For additional information, please consult the VIREAD prescribing information. Cases of osteomalacia (associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and which may contribute to fractures) have been reported in association with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TRUVADA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.8 Early Virologic Failure Clinical trials in HIV-infected subjects have demonstrated that certain regimens that only contain three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are generally less effective than triple drug regimens containing two NRTIs in combination with either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. In particular, early virological failure and high rates of resistance substitutions have been reported. Triple nucleoside regimens should therefore be used with caution. Patients on a therapy utilizing a triple nucleoside-only regimen should be carefully monitored and considered for treatment modification."

Drug interaction trials have been conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the components of TRUVADA. This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions observed with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Didanosine: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations. Use with caution and monitor for evidence of didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis, neuropathy) when coadministered. Consider dose reductions or discontinuations of didanosine if warranted. ( 7.1) HIV-1 protease inhibitors: Coadministration decreases atazanavir concentrations and increases tenofovir concentrations. When coadministered with TRUVADA, use atazanavir given with ritonavir. Coadministration of TRUVADA with atazanavir and ritonavir, darunavir and ritonavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir increases tenofovir concentrations. Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. ( 7.2) 7.1 Didanosine Coadministration of TRUVADA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered with didanosine the C max and AUC of didanosine increased significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis, and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg when it is coadministered with TRUVADA. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for adult or pediatric patients weighing less than 60 kg. When coadministered, TRUVADA and Videx EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (less than 400 kcal, 20% fat). 7.2 HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors Tenofovir decreases the AUC and C min of atazanavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . When coadministered with TRUVADA, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. TRUVADA should not be coadministered with atazanavir without ritonavir . Lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir, and darunavir coadministered with ritonavir have been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters. When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is co-administered with an inhibitor of these transporters, an increase in absorption may be observed. Patients receiving TRUVADA concomitantly with lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, or ritonavir-boosted darunavir should be monitored for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated adverse reactions . 7.3 Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and HARVONI ® (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . In patients receiving TRUVADA concomitantly with HARVONI without an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/ritonavir or an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/cobicistat combination, monitor for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In patients receiving TRUVADA concomitantly with HARVONI and an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/ritonavir or an HIV-1 protease inhibitor/cobicistat combination, consider an alternative HCV or antiretroviral therapy, as the safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in this setting has not been established. If coadministration is necessary, monitor for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . No drug-drug interactions due to competition for renal excretion have been observed; however, coadministration of TRUVADA with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or the coadministered drug. Some examples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine and/or tenofovir."

Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934, an active-controlled clinical trial of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. See also Table 3 for the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse reactions (Grades 2–4) occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects treated in any treatment group in this trial. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles, was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Study 934 - Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions: In Study 934, 511 antiretroviral-naïve subjects received either VIREAD + EMTRIVA administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254) for 144 weeks. Subjects had a mean age of 40 years (range 20 to 73 years) and were predominantly male (88%). Overall, 65% were White, 17% were Black, and 13% were Hispanic. Adverse reactions observed in this trial were generally consistent with those seen in other trials in treatment-experienced or treatment-naïve subjects receiving VIREAD and/or EMTRIVA (Table 3). Table 3 Selected Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug.

In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above for Study 934, Grades 3–4 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (>2.5 × ULN), increased pancreatic amylase (>2.0 × ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (<40 or >250 mg/dL), and increased serum lipase (>2.0 × ULN) occurred in up to 3% of subjects treated with EMTRIVA or VIREAD with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects Emtricitabine: In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with EMTRIVA in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In pediatric clinical trials (Studies 352 and 321) conducted in 184 HIV-1 infected subjects 2 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with VIREAD were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of VIREAD in adults. Eighty-nine pediatric subjects (2 to less than 12 years of age) received VIREAD in Study 352 for a median exposure of 104 weeks. Of these, 4 subjects discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy. Three of these 4 subjects presented with hypophosphatemia and also had decreases in total body or spine BMD Z score [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. For additional information, consult the VIREAD prescribing information. 6.2 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trial Experience in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Subjects No new adverse reactions to TRUVADA were identified from two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (iPrEx, Partners PrEP), in which 2,830 HIV-1 uninfected adults received TRUVADA once daily for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Subjects were followed for a median of 71 weeks and 87 weeks, respectively. These trials enrolled HIV-negative individuals ranging in age from 18 to 67 years. The iPrEx trial enrolled only men or transgender women of Hispanic/Latino (72%), White (18%), Black (9%) and Asian (5%) race. The Partners PrEP trial enrolled both men (61–64% across treatment groups) and women in Kenya and Uganda. Table 5 provides a list of all adverse events that occurred in 2% or more of subjects in any treatment group in the iPrEx and Partners PrEP trials. Laboratory Abnormalities: Table 6 provides a list of laboratory abnormalities observed in both trials. Six subjects in the TDF-containing arms of the Partners PrEP trial discontinued participation in the study due to an increase in blood creatinine compared with no discontinuations in the placebo group. One subject in the TRUVADA arm of the iPrEx trial discontinued from the study due to an increase in blood creatinine and another due to low phosphorous. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above, Grade 1 proteinuria (1+) occurred in 6% of subjects receiving TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial. Grades 2–3 proteinuria (2–4+) and glycosuria (3+) occurred in less than 1% of subjects treated with TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial and Partners PrEP trial.

In the iPrEx trial, a substudy of 503 subjects found mean changes from baseline in BMD ranging from –0.4% to –1.0% across total hip, spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in the TRUVADA group compared with the placebo group, which returned toward baseline after discontinuation of treatment. Thirteen percent of subjects receiving TRUVADA versus 6% of subjects receiving placebo lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine during treatment. Bone fractures were reported in 1.7% of the TRUVADA group compared with 1.4% in the placebo group. No correlation between BMD and fractures was noted [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . The Partners PrEP trial found similar fracture rates between treatment and placebo groups (0.8% and 0.6%, respectively). No BMD evaluations were performed during this trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] . 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of VIREAD. No additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of EMTRIVA. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess estimated creatinine clearance before initiating treatment with TRUVADA. In patients at risk for renal dysfunction, assess estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose and urine protein before initiating treatment with TRUVADA and periodically during treatment. Avoid administering Truvada with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. ( 5.3) Coadministration with Other Products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, GENVOYA, ODEFSEY, STRIBILD, VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. ( 5.4) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. ( 5.5) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. ( 5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. ( 5.7) Triple nucleoside-only regimens: Early virologic failure has been reported in HIV-infected patients. Monitor carefully and consider treatment modification. ( 5.8) Comprehensive management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1: Use as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy including other prevention measures; strictly adhere to dosing schedule. ( 5.9) Management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 drug resistance: Prior to initiating TRUVADA for PrEP - if clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm negative HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. While using TRUVADA for PrEP - HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. ( 5.9) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including VIREAD, a component of TRUVADA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient or uninfected individual with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in HIV-1 infected patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with TRUVADA should be suspended in any patient or uninfected individual who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 HBV Infection It is recommended that all individuals be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating TRUVADA. TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients infected with HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are infected with HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with TRUVADA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. HBV-uninfected individuals should be offered vaccination. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . It is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance be assessed in all individuals prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with TRUVADA. In patients at risk of renal dysfunction, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA ®, it is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed prior to initiation of TRUVADA, and periodically during TRUVADA therapy. TRUVADA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] . Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF). Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients. Treatment of HIV-1 Infection Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with estimated creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received TRUVADA using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of TRUVADA therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. TRUVADA should not be administered to patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis TRUVADA for a PrEP indication should not be used if estimated creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance is observed in uninfected individuals while using TRUVADA for PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.4 Coadministration with Other Products TRUVADA is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Do not coadminister TRUVADA with other drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or containing tenofovir alafenamide, including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, GENVOYA, ODEFSEY, STRIBILD, or VIREAD. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, do not coadminister TRUVADA with other drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Dutrebis (lamivudine/raltegravir) , Epivir or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), Triumeq (abacavir sulfate/dolutegravir/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister TRUVADA with HEPSERA (adefovir dipivoxil) Do not coadminister TRUVADA with HEPSERA (adefovir dipivoxil) . 5.5 Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF Bone Mineral Density: In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults and in a clinical trial of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, tenofovir DF was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and VIREAD prescribing information ]. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. Clinical trials evaluating tenofovir DF in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the tenofovir DF treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in chronic hepatitis B infected adolescent subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. For more information, consult the VIREAD prescribing information. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects: Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in HIV-1 infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TRUVADA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Early Virologic Failure Clinical trials in HIV-1 infected subjects have demonstrated that certain regimens that only contain three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are generally less effective than triple drug regimens containing two NRTIs in combination with either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. In particular, early virologic failure and high rates of resistance substitutions have been reported. Triple nucleoside regimens should therefore be used with caution. Patients on a therapy utilizing a triple nucleoside-only regimen should be carefully monitored and considered for treatment modification. 5.9 Comprehensive Management to Reduce the Risk of Acquiring HIV-1 Use TRUVADA for pre-exposure prophylaxis only as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes other prevention measures, such as safer sex practices, because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1 [see Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3)] . Counsel uninfected individuals about safer sex practices that include consistent and correct use of condoms, knowledge of their HIV-1 status and that of their partner(s), and regular testing for other sexually transmitted infections that can facilitate HIV-1 transmission (such as syphilis and gonorrhea). Inform uninfected individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior. Use TRUVADA to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 only in individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only TRUVADA, because TRUVADA alone does not constitute a complete treatment regimen for HIV-1 treatment [see Microbiology (12.4)] ; therefore, care should be taken to minimize drug exposure in HIV-infected individuals. Many HIV-1 tests, such as rapid tests, detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, evaluate seronegative individuals for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute viral infections (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash, etc.) and ask about potential exposure events (e.g., unprotected, or condom broke during sex with an HIV-1 infected partner) that may have occurred within the last month. If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. While using TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. If symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, PrEP should be discontinued until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. Counsel uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the recommended TRUVADA dosing schedule. The effectiveness of TRUVADA in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3)] ."

Severe acute exacerbations of Hepatitis B [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Immune reconstitution syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, rash, abdominal pain, asthenia, increased cough, and rhinitis. Skin hyperpigmentation was very common (≥10%) in pediatric patients.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%, any severity) identified from any of the 3 large controlled clinical trials include headache, diarrhea nausea, fatigue, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, rash, abdominal pain, asthenia, increased cough, and rhinitis. Studies 301A and 303 - Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving EMTRIVA with other antiretroviral agents in clinical studies 301A and 303 were headache, diarrhea, nausea, and rash, which were generally of mild to moderate severity. Approximately 1% of patients discontinued participation in the clinical studies due to these events. All adverse reactions were reported with similar frequency in EMTRIVA and control treatment groups with the exception of skin discoloration which was reported with higher frequency in the EMTRIVA treated group. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. A summary of EMTRIVA treatment emergent clinical adverse reactions in studies 301A and 303 is provided in Table 2.

The adverse reaction profile in pediatric patients was generally comparable to that observed in clinical studies of EMTRIVA in adult patients [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hyperpigmentation was more frequent in children. Additional adverse reactions identified from this study include anemia. Selected treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of causality, reported in patients during 48 weeks of treatment were the following: infection (44%), hyperpigmentation (32%), increased cough (28%), vomiting (23%), otitis media (23%), rash (21%), rhinitis (20%), diarrhea (20%), fever (18%), pneumonia (15%), gastroenteritis (11%), abdominal pain (10%), and anemia (7%). Treatment-emergent grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities were experienced by 9% of pediatric patients, including amylase >2.0 × ULN (n=4), neutrophils <750/mm3 (n=3), ALT >5 × ULN (n=2), elevated CPK (>4 × ULN) (n=2) and one patient each with elevated bilirubin (>3.0 × ULN), elevated GGT (>10 × ULN), elevated lipase (>2.5 × ULN), decreased hemoglobin (<7 g/dL), and decreased glucose (<40 mg/dL)."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Products with same active ingredient: Do not use with other emtricitabine-containing products (e.g., ATRIPLA and TRUVADA). (5.3) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.6) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs alone or in combination, including emtricitabine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver diseases; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EMTRIVA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy. EMTRIVA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of EMTRIVA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of Hepatitis B have been reported in patients after the discontinuation of EMTRIVA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue EMTRIVA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-Hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 Coadministration with Related Products EMTRIVA is a component of TRUVADA (a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and ATRIPLA (a fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). EMTRIVA should not be coadministered with TRUVADA or ATRIPLA. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, EMTRIVA should not be coadministered with other drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). 5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine is principally eliminated by the kidney. Reduction of the dosage of EMTRIVA is recommended for patients with impaired renal function [See Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EMTRIVA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction trials have been conducted using TRUVADA tablets. Drug interaction trials have been conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the components of TRUVADA. This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions observed with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Didanosine: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations. Use with caution and monitor for evidence of didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis, neuropathy) when coadministered. Consider dose reductions or discontinuations of didanosine if warranted. (7.1) Atazanavir: Coadministration decreases atazanavir concentrations and increases tenofovir concentrations. Use atazanavir with TRUVADA only with ritonavir; monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.2) Lopinavir/ritonavir: Coadministration increases tenofovir concentrations. Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.3) 7.1 Didanosine Coadministration of TRUVADA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered with didanosine the Cmax and AUC of didanosine administered as either the buffered or enteric-coated formulation increased significantly [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis, and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg when it is coadministered with TRUVADA. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for adult or pediatric patients weighing less than 60 kg. When coadministered, TRUVADA and Videx EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (less than 400 kcal, 20% fat). Coadministration of didanosine buffered tablet formulation with TRUVADA should be under fasted conditions. 7.2 Atazanavir Atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving atazanavir and TRUVADA should be monitored for TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir decreases the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When coadministered with TRUVADA, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Atazanavir without ritonavir should not be coadministered with TRUVADA. 7.3 Lopinavir/Ritonavir Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir and TRUVADA should be monitored for TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No drug-drug interactions due to competition for renal excretion have been observed; however, coadministration of TRUVADA with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or the coadministered drug. Some examples include, but are not limited to acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, and valganciclovir. Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine and/or tenofovir."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe Acute Exacerbations of hepatitis B [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Decreases in Bone Mineral Density [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. In HIV1 infected patients, the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%) are diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. (6.1) In HIV-1 uninfected individuals in PrEP trials, adverse reactions that were reported by more than 2% of TRUVADA subjects and more frequently than by placebo subjects were headache, abdominal pain and weight decreased. (6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-445-3235 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in HIV-1 Infected Subjects Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934, an active-controlled clinical trial of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. See also Table 2 for the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse reactions (Grade 2–4) occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects treated in any treatment group in this trial. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles, was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Study 934 - Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions: In Study 934, 511 antiretroviral-naive subjects received either VIREAD + EMTRIVA administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254) for 144 weeks. Subjects had a mean age of 40 years (range 20 to 73 years) and were predominantly male (88%). Overall, 65% were White, 17% were Black, and 13% were Hispanic. Adverse reactions observed in this trial were generally consistent with those seen in other trials in treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving VIREAD and/or EMTRIVA (Table 2).

In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above for Study 934, Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (>2.5 × ULN), increased pancreatic amylase (>2.0 × ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (<40 or >250 mg/dL), and increased serum lipase (>2.0 × ULN) occurred in up to 3% of subjects treated with EMTRIVA or VIREAD with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older Emtricitabine: In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with EMTRIVA in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, please consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a pediatric clinical trial conducted in subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with VIREAD were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of VIREAD in adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 6.2 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trial Experience in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Subjects No new adverse reactions to TRUVADA were identified from two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (iPrEx, Partners PrEP) in which 2830 HIV-1 uninfected adults received TRUVADA once daily for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Subjects were followed for a median of 71 weeks and 87 weeks, respectively. These trials enrolled HIV-negative individuals ranging in age from 18 to 67 years. The iPrEx trial enrolled only males or transgender females of Hispanic/Latino (72%), White (18%), Black (9%) and Asian (5%) race. The Partners PrEP trial enrolled both males (61–64% across treatment groups) and females in Kenya and Uganda. Table 4 provides a list of all adverse events that occurred ≥2% of subjects in any treatment group in the iPrEx and Partners PrEP trials. Laboratory Abnormalities: Table 5 provides a list of laboratory abnormalities observed in both trials. Six subjects in the TDF-containing arms of the Partners PrEP trial discontinued participation in the study due to an increase in blood creatinine compared with no discontinuations in the placebo group. One subject in the TRUVADA arm of the iPrEx trial discontinued from the study due to an increase in blood creatinine and another due to low phosphorous. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above, Grade 1 proteinuria (1+) occurred in 6% of subjects receiving TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial. Grade 2–3 proteinuria (2–4+) and glycosuria (3+) occurred in less than 1% of subjects treated with TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial and Partners PrEP trial.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CrCl) before initiating treatment with TRUVADA. Monitor CrCl and serum phosphorus in patients at risk. Avoid administering Truvada with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Coadministration with Other Products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.5) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.7) Triple nucleoside-only regimens: Early virologic failure has been reported in HIV-infected patients. Monitor carefully and consider treatment modification. (5.8) Comprehensive management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1: Use as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy including other prevention measures; strictly adhere to dosing schedule. (5.9) Management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 drug resistance: Prior to initiating TRUVADA for PrEP - if clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm negative HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. While using TRUVADA for PrEP - HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. (5.9) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including VIREAD, a component of TRUVADA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient or uninfected individual with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in HIV-1 infected patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with TRUVADA should be suspended in any patient or uninfected individual who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 HBV Infection It is recommended that all individuals be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating TRUVADA. TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients infected with HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are infected with HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with TRUVADA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. HBV -uninfected individuals should be offered vaccination. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. It is recommended that creatinine clearance be calculated in all individuals prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with TRUVADA. Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in all individuals at risk for renal impairment, including individuals who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA. TRUVADA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. Treatment of HIV-1 Infection Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min, [See Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received TRUVADA using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of TRUVADA therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. TRUVADA should not be administered to patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis TRUVADA for a PrEP indication should not be used if creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in creatinine clearance is observed in uninfected individuals while using TRUVADA for PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use [See Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.4 Coadministration with Other Products TRUVADA is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Do not coadminister TRUVADA with ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, or VIREAD. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, do not coadminister TRUVADA with other drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister TRUVADA with HEPSERA® (adefovir dipivoxil). 5.5 Decreases in Bone Mineral Density Assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) should be considered for adults and in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a 144-week trial of treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects, decreases in BMD were seen at the lumbar spine and hip in both arms of the trial. At Week 144, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving VIREAD + lamivudine + efavirenz compared with subjects receiving stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz. Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups. In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24–48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through 144 weeks. Twenty-eight percent of VIREAD-treated subjects vs. 21% of the comparator subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the VIREAD group and 6 subjects in the comparator group. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C-telopeptide, and urinary N-telopeptide), suggesting increased bone turnover. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving VIREAD. In a clinical trial of HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older (Study 321), bone effects were similar to adult subjects. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in this age group. In this trial, the mean rate of bone gain was less in the VIREAD-treated group compared to the placebo group. Six VIREAD treated subjects and one placebo treated subject had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss in 48 weeks. Among 28 subjects receiving 96 weeks of VIREAD, Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. Skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. Markers of bone turnover in VIREAD-treated pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older suggest increased bone turnover, consistent with the effects observed in adults. In clinical trials of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, decreases in BMD were observed. In the iPrEx trial, a substudy of 503 subjects found mean changes from baseline in BMD ranging from -0.4% to -1.0% across total hip, spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in the TRUVADA group compared with the placebo group, which returned toward baseline after discontinuation of treatment. Thirteen percent of subjects receiving TRUVADA vs. 6% of subjects receiving placebo lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine during treatment. Bone fractures were reported in 1.7% of the TRUVADA group compared with 1.4% in the placebo group. No correlation between BMD and fractures was noted [See Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The Partners PrEP trial found similar fracture rates between treatment and placebo groups (0.8% and 0.6%, respectively). No BMD evaluations were conducted during this trial [See Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The effects of VIREAD-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. For additional information, please consult the VIREAD prescribing information. Cases of osteomalacia (associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and which may contribute to fractures) have been reported in association with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in HIV-1 infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TRUVADA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Early Virologic Failure Clinical trials in HIV-1 infected subjects have demonstrated that certain regimens that only contain three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are generally less effective than triple drug regimens containing two NRTIs in combination with either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. In particular, early virological failure and high rates of resistance substitutions have been reported. Triple nucleoside regimens should therefore be used with caution. Patients on a therapy utilizing a triple nucleoside-only regimen should be carefully monitored and considered for treatment modification. 5.9 Comprehensive Management to Reduce the Risk of Acquiring HIV-1 Use TRUVADA for pre-exposure prophylaxis only as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes other prevention measures, such as safer sex practices, because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1 [See Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3)]. Counsel uninfected individuals about safer sex practices that include consistent and correct use of condoms, knowledge of their HIV-1 status and that of their partner(s), and regular testing for other sexually transmitted infections that can facilitate HIV-1 transmission (such as syphilis and gonorrhea). Inform uninfected individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior. Use TRUVADA to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 only in individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only TRUVADA, because TRUVADA alone does not constitute a complete treatment regimen for HIV-1 treatment [See Microbiology: Resistance (12.4)]; therefore, care should be taken to minimize drug exposure in HIV-infected individuals. Many HIV-1 tests, such as rapid tests, detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, evaluate seronegative individuals for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute viral infections (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash, etc.) and ask about potential exposure events (e.g., unprotected, or condom broke during sex with an HIV-1 infected partner) that may have occurred within the last month. If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. While using TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. If symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, PrEP should be discontinued until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. Counsel uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the recommended TRUVADA dosing schedule. The effectiveness of TRUVADA in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials [See Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted using TRUVADA tablets. Drug interaction studies have been conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the components of TRUVADA. This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions observed with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Didanosine: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations. Use with caution and monitor for evidence of didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis, neuropathy) when coadministered. Consider dose reductions or discontinuations of didanosine if warranted. (7.1) Atazanavir: Coadministration decreases atazanavir concentrations and increases tenofovir concentrations. Use atazanavir with TRUVADA only with ritonavir; monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.2) Lopinavir/ritonavir: Coadministration increases tenofovir concentrations. Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity. (7.2) 7.1 Didanosine Coadministration of TRUVADA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered with didanosine the Cmax and AUC of didanosine administered as either the buffered or enteric-coated formulation increased significantly [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis, and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In adults weighing >60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg when it is coadministered with TRUVADA. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for patients weighing <60 kg. When coadministered, TRUVADA and Videx EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (<400 kcal, 20% fat). Coadministration of didanosine buffered tablet formulation with TRUVADA should be under fasted conditions. 7.2 Atazanavir Atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving atazanavir and TRUVADA should be monitored for TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir decreases the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When coadministered with TRUVADA, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Atazanavir without ritonavir should not be coadministered with TRUVADA. 7.3 Lopinavir/Ritonavir Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir and TRUVADA should be monitored for TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. 7.4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No drug-drug interactions due to competition for renal excretion have been observed; however, coadministration of TRUVADA with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or the coadministered drug. Some examples include, but are not limited to acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, and valganciclovir. Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine and/or tenofovir."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe Acute Exacerbations of hepatitis B [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Decreases in Bone Mineral Density [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) are diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash.

The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934, an active-controlled clinical study of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. See also Table 2 for the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse reactions (Grade 2–4) occurring in ≥5% of subjects treated with efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in this study. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Study 934 - Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions: In Study 934, 511 antiretroviral-naive subjects received either VIREAD + EMTRIVA administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254). Adverse reactions observed in this study were generally consistent with those seen in other studies in treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving VIREAD and/or EMTRIVA (Table 2).

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CrCl) before initiating treatment with TRUVADA. Monitor CrCl and serum phosphorus in patients at risk. Avoid administering Truvada with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Coadministration with Other Products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, EMTRIVA, VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or who are at risk for osteopenia. (5.5) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.7) Triple nucleoside-only regimens: Early virologic failure has been reported in HIV-infected patients. Monitor carefully and consider treatment modification. (5.8) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including VIREAD, a component of TRUVADA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with TRUVADA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy. TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow up for at least several months after stopping treatment with Truvada. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. It is recommended that creatinine clearance be calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with TRUVADA. Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in patients at risk for renal impairment, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA. Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min, [See Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received TRUVADA using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of TRUVADA therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. TRUVADA should not be administered to patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis. TRUVADA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. 5.4 Coadministration with Other Products TRUVADA is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. TRUVADA should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA, EMTRIVA, or VIREAD. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, TRUVADA should not be coadministered with other drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). TRUVADA should not be administered with HEPSERA® (adefovir dipivoxil). 5.5 Decreases in Bone Mineral Density Bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring should be considered for HIV-1 infected patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or are at risk for osteopenia. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a 144-week study of treatment-naive subjects, decreases in BMD were seen at the lumbar spine and hip in both arms of the study. At Week 144, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving VIREAD + lamivudine + efavirenz compared with subjects receiving stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz. Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups. In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24–48 weeks of the study and this reduction was sustained through 144 weeks. Twenty-eight percent of VIREAD-treated subjects vs. 21% of the comparator subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the VIREAD group and 6 subjects in the comparator group. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C-telopeptide, and urinary N-telopeptide), suggesting increased bone turnover. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving VIREAD. The effects of VIREAD-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. For additional information, please consult the VIREAD prescribing information. Cases of osteomalacia (associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and which may contribute to fractures) have been reported in association with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS COMPLERA is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, COMPLERA should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications. Information regarding potential drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided. Please refer to the Edurant, VIREAD and EMTRIVA prescribing information as needed. This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions with COMPLERA. Drug interaction studies were conducted with the components of COMPLERA (emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir DF as single agents) or with COMPLERA as a combination product [See Dosage and Administration (2), Contraindications (4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. COMPLERA is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, COMPLERA should not be administered with other antiretroviral medications for treatment of HIV-1 infection. CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors: Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may affect the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. (7.1) Drugs that increase gastric pH: Drugs that increase gastric pH may decrease plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs Inducing or Inhibiting CYP3A Enzymes Rilpivirine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, and drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Contraindications (4)]. Coadministration of rilpivirine and drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine and loss of virologic response and possible resistance to rilpivirine or to the class of NNRTIs. Coadministration of rilpivirine and drugs that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. Rilpivirine at a dose of 25 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes. 7.2 Drugs Increasing Gastric pH Coadministration of rilpivirine with drugs that increase gastric pH may decrease plasma concentrations of rilpivirine and loss of virologic response and possible resistance to rilpivirine or to the class of NNRTIs [See Table 4]. 7.3 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Because emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys through a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of COMPLERA with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or other renally eliminated drugs. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 7.4 QT Prolonging Drugs There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between rilpivirine and drugs that prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram. In a study of healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. COMPLERA should be used with caution when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. 7.5 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Important drug interaction information for COMPLERA is summarized in Table 4. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with emtricitabine, rilpivirine, or tenofovir DF as individual medications or with COMPLERA as a combination product, or are potential drug interactions [for pharmacokinetic data see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Tables 6–7]. The tables include potentially significant interactions, but are not all inclusive. Table 4 Established and Other Potentially SignificantThis table is not all inclusive. Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on ConcentrationIncrease = ↑; Decrease = ↓; No Effect = ↔ Clinical Comment Antacids: antacids (e.g., aluminium, magnesium hydroxide, or calcium carbonate) ↔ rilpivirine (antacids taken at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after rilpivirine) ↓ rilpivirine (concomitant intake) The combination of COMPLERA and antacids should be used with caution as coadministration may cause significant decreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations (increase in gastric pH). Antacids should only be administered either at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after COMPLERA. Antimycobacterials: rifabutin ↓ rilpivirineThe interaction was evaluated in a clinical study. All other drug-drug interactions shown are predicted. Concomitant use of COMPLERA with rifabutin may cause significant decreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations (induction of CYP3A enzymes). If COMPLERA is coadministered with rifabutin, an additional 25 mg tablet of rilpivirine (Edurant) once per day is recommended to be taken concomitantly with COMPLERA and with a meal for the duration of rifabutin coadministration. Azole Antifungal Agents: fluconazole itraconazole ketoconazole posaconazole voriconazole ↑ rilpivirine , This interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for rilpivirine. The dosing recommendation is applicable to the recommended dose of rilpivirine 25 mg once daily. ↓ ketoconazole , Concomitant use of COMPLERA with azole antifungal agents may cause an increase in the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine (inhibition of CYP3A enzymes). No dose adjustment is required when COMPLERA is coadministered with azole antifungal agents. Clinically monitor for breakthrough fungal infections when azole antifungals are coadministered with COMPLERA. Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents: ledipasvir/sofosbuvir ↑ tenofovir Patients receiving COMPLERA concomitantly with HARVONI® (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) should be monitored for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. H2-Receptor Antagonists: cimetidine famotidine nizatidine ranitidine ↔ rilpivirine , (famotidine taken 12 hours before rilpivirine or 4 hours after rilpivirine) ↓ rilpivirine , (famotidine taken 2 hours before rilpivirine) The combination of COMPLERA and H2-receptor antagonists should be used with caution as coadministration may cause significant decreases in rilpivirine plasma concentrations (increase in gastric pH). H2-receptor antagonists should only be administered at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after COMPLERA. Macrolide or Ketolide Antibiotics: clarithromycin erythromycin telithromycin ↑ rilpivirine ↔ clarithromycin ↔ erythromycin ↔ telithromycin Concomitant use of COMPLERA with clarithromycin, erythromycin or telithromycin may cause an increase in the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine (inhibition of CYP3A enzymes). Where possible, alternatives such as azithromycin should be considered. Narcotic Analgesics: methadone ↓ R(−) methadone ↓ S(+) methadone ↔ rilpivirine ↔ methadone (when used with tenofovir) No dose adjustments are required when initiating coadministration of methadone with COMPLERA. However, clinical monitoring is recommended as methadone maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients. 7.6 Drugs with No Observed or Predicted Interactions with COMPLERA No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between emtricitabine and the following medications: famciclovir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or tenofovir DF. No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between tenofovir DF and the following medications: entecavir, methadone, oral contraceptives, ribavirin, sofosbuvir, or tacrolimus in studies conducted in healthy subjects. No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between rilpivirine and the following medications: acetaminophen, atorvastatin, chlorzoxazone, ethinyl estradiol, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, norethindrone, sildenafil, simeprevir, sofosbuvir, telaprevir, or tenofovir DF. Rilpivirine did not have a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or metformin. No clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is expected when rilpivirine is coadministered with ribavirin."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse drug reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Depressive Disorders [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Hepatotoxicity [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF [See Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Most common adverse drug reactions to rilpivirine (incidence greater than or equal to 2%, Grades 2–4) are depressive disorders, insomnia, and headache. (6.1) Most common adverse drug reactions to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (incidence ≥10%) are diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In HIV-1-Infected Subjects With No Antiretroviral Treatment History Studies C209 and C215 – Treatment-Emergent Adverse Drug Reactions: The safety assessment of rilpivirine, used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, is based on the Week 96 pooled data from 1368 subjects in the Phase 3 trials TMC278-C209 (ECHO) and TMC278-C215 (THRIVE) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected adult subjects. A total of 686 subjects received rilpivirine in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as background regimen; most (N=550) received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF as background regimen. The number of subjects randomized to the control arm efavirenz was 682, of which 546 received emtricitabine/tenofovir DF as background regimen [See Clinical Studies (14)]. The median duration of exposure for subjects in either treatment arm was 104 weeks. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) observed at Week 96 in subjects who received rilpivirine or efavirenz plus emtricitabine/tenofovir DF as background regimen are shown in Table 1. No new types of adverse reactions were identified between Week 48 and Week 96. The adverse drug reactions observed in this subset of subjects were generally consistent with those seen for the overall patient population participating in these studies (refer to the prescribing information for Edurant). The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment with rilpivirine or efavirenz + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF due to ADR, regardless of severity, was 2% and 5%, respectively. The most common ADRs leading to discontinuation were psychiatric disorders: 9 (1.6%) subjects in the rilpivirine + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF arm and 12 (2.2%) subjects in the efavirenz + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF arm. Rash led to discontinuation in 1 (0.2%) subject in the rilpivirine + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF arm and 10 (1.8%) subjects in the efavirenz + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF arm. Common Adverse Drug Reactions Clinical ADRs to rilpivirine or efavirenz of at least moderate intensity (≥ Grade 2) reported in at least 2% of adult subjects are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Selected Treatment-Emergent Adverse Drug ReactionsFrequencies of adverse reactions are based on all Grades 2–4 treatment-emergent adverse events assessed to be related to study drug. (Grades 2–4) Reported in ≥2% of Subjects Receiving Rilpivirine or Efavirenz in Combination with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF in Studies C209 and C215 (Week 96 analysis) Rilpivirine + FTC/TDF Efavirenz + FTC/TDF N=550 N=546 Gastrointestinal Disorder Nausea 1% 2% Nervous System Disorders Headache 2% 2% Dizziness 1% 7% Psychiatric Disorders Depressive disordersIncludes adverse drug reactions reported as depressed mood, depression, dysphoria, major depression, mood altered, negative thoughts, suicide attempt, suicide ideation. 2% 2% Insomnia 2% 2% Abnormal dreams 1% 3% Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash 1% 5% Rilpivirine: Treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions of at least moderate intensity (≥ Grade 2) that occurred in less than 2% of subjects treated with rilpivirine plus any of the allowed background regimens (N=686) in clinical studies C209 and C215 include (grouped by Body System): vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, fatigue, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, decreased appetite, somnolence, sleep disorders, anxiety, glomerulonephritis membranous, glomerulonephritis mesangioproliferative, and nephrolithiasis. In Virologically-Suppressed HIV-1-Infected Subjects No new adverse reactions to COMPLERA were identified in stable, virologically-suppressed subjects switching to COMPLERA from a regimen containing a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor; however the frequency of adverse reactions increased by 20% (Study 106) after switching to COMPLERA. Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: The following adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials of emtricitabine or tenofovir DF in combination with other antiretroviral agents: The most common adverse drug reactions occurring in at least 10% of HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve adult subjects in a Phase 3 clinical trial of emtricitabine and tenofovir DF in combination with another antiretroviral agent are diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. In addition, adverse drug reactions that occurred in at least 5% of treatment-experienced or treatment-naïve subjects receiving emtricitabine or tenofovir DF with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials include abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, fever, pain, nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy (including peripheral neuritis and neuropathy), anxiety, increased cough, and rhinitis. Skin discoloration has been reported with higher frequency among emtricitabine-treated subjects; it was manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles and was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Laboratory Abnormalities: The percentage of subjects treated with rilpivirine + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF or efavirenz + emtricitabine/tenofovir DF in studies C209 and C215 with selected treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1 to 4), representing worst grade toxicity, are presented in Table 2. Table 2 Selected Laboratory Abnormalities (Grades 1–4) Reported in Subjects Who Received Rilpivirine or Efavirenz in Combination with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir DF in Studies C209 and C215 (Week 96 Analysis) Rilpivirine + FTC/TDF Efavirenz + FTC/TDF Laboratory Parameter Abnormality, (%) DAIDS Toxicity Range N=550 N=546 N = number of subjects per treatment group Note: Percentages were calculated versus the number of subjects in ITT population with emtricitabine + tenofovir DF as background regimen.

Adrenal Function In the pooled Phase 3 trials of C209 and C215, in subjects treated with rilpivirine plus any of the allowed background regimen (N=686), at Week 96, there was an overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol of -19.1 (95% CI: -30.9; -7.4) nmol/L in the rilpivirine group, and of -0.6 (95% CI: -13.3; 12.2) nmol/L in the efavirenz group. At Week 96, the mean change from baseline in ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels was lower in the rilpivirine group (+18.4 ± 8.36 nmol/L) than in the efavirenz group (+54.1 ± 7.24 nmol/L). Mean values for both basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol values at Week 96 were within the normal range. Overall, there were no serious adverse events, deaths, or treatment discontinuations that could clearly be attributed to adrenal insufficiency. Effects on adrenal function were comparable by background N(t)RTIs. Serum Creatinine In the pooled Phase 3 trials of C209 and C215 trials in subjects treated with rilpivirine plus any of the allowed background regimen (N=686), there was a small increase in serum creatinine over 96 weeks of treatment with rilpivirine. Most of this increase occurred within the first four weeks of treatment with a mean change of 0.1 mg/dL (range: -0.3 mg/dL to 0.6 mg/dL) observed through Week 96. In subjects who entered the trial with mild or moderate renal impairment, the serum creatinine increase observed was similar to that seen in subjects with normal renal function. These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant and no subject discontinued treatment due to increases in serum creatinine. Creatinine increases were comparable by background N(t)RTIs. Serum Lipids Changes from baseline in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides are presented in Table 3.

The same increase was also observed in the efavirenz arm. The pharmacokinetic exposure of rilpivirine in coinfected subjects was comparable to that in subjects without coinfection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing experience in patients receiving rilpivirine- or tenofovir DF-containing regimens. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. COMPLERA: Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions including DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) Rilpivirine: Renal and Urinary Disorders nephrotic syndrome Emtricitabine: No postmarketing adverse reactions have been identified for inclusion in this section. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Immune System Disorders allergic reaction, including angioedema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders pancreatitis, increased amylase, abdominal pain Hepatobiliary Disorders hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes (most commonly AST, ALT gamma GT) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders rash Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and which may contribute to fractures), muscular weakness, myopathy Renal and Urinary Disorders acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, interstitial nephritis (including acute cases), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal insufficiency, increased creatinine, proteinuria, polyuria General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions asthenia The following adverse reactions, listed under the body system headings above, may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy: rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, hypophosphatemia."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing experience, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). Immediately discontinue treatment if hypersensitivity or rash with systemic symptoms or elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries develops and closely monitor clinical status, including hepatic serum biochemistries. (5.3) New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess estimated creatinine clearance before initiating treatment with COMPLERA. In patients at risk for renal dysfunction, assess estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose and urine protein before initiating treatment with COMPLERA and periodically during treatment. Avoid administering COMPLERA with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.4) Caution should be given to prescribing COMPLERA with drugs that may reduce the exposure of rilpivirine. (5.5) Caution should be given to prescribing COMPLERA with drugs with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. (5.5) Depressive disorders: Severe depressive disorders have been reported. Immediate medical evaluation is recommended for severe depressive disorders. (5.6) Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a rilpivirine-containing regimen. Monitor liver-associated tests before and during treatment with COMPLERA in patients with underlying hepatic disease or marked elevations in liver-associated tests. Also consider monitoring liver-associated tests in patients without risk factors. (5.7) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.8) Coadministration with other products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine, rilpivirine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, EMTRIVA, STRIBILD, TRUVADA, VIREAD, or with drugs containing lamivudine. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. Do not coadminister in combination with rilpivirine (Edurant) unless required for dose adjustment when coadministered with rifabutin. (5.9) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.10) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.11) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir DF, a component of COMPLERA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with COMPLERA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus before initiating antiretroviral therapy. COMPLERA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of COMPLERA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of COMPLERA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA®, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with COMPLERA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during the postmarketing experience, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) with rilpivirine-containing regimens. While some skin reactions were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, other skin reactions were associated with organ dysfunctions, including elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries. During the Phase 3 clinical trials, treatment-related rashes with at least Grade 2 severity were reported in 1% of subjects receiving rilpivirine plus emtricitabine/tenofovir DF. Overall, most rashes were Grade 1 or 2 and occurred in the first four to six weeks of therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)]. Discontinue COMPLERA immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop, including but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, blisters, mucosal involvement, conjunctivitis, facial edema, angioedema, hepatitis or eosinophilia. Clinical status including laboratory parameters should be monitored and appropriate therapy should be initiated. 5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. It is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance be assessed in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with COMPLERA. In patients at risk of renal dysfunction, including patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA®, it is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance, serum phosphorus, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed prior to initiation of COMPLERA, and periodically during COMPLERA therapy. COMPLERA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) [See Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction. Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients. Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney; however, rilpivirine is not. Since COMPLERA is a combination product and the dose of the individual components cannot be altered, patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 50 mL per minute should not receive COMPLERA. 5.5 Drug Interactions Caution should be given to prescribing COMPLERA with drugs that may reduce the exposure of rilpivirine [See Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram [See Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. COMPLERA should be used with caution when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. 5.6 Depressive Disorders The adverse reaction depressive disorders (depressed mood, depression, dysphoria, major depression, mood altered, negative thoughts, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation) has been reported with rilpivirine. During the Phase 3 trials (N=1368) through 96 weeks, the incidence of depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) reported among rilpivirine (N=686) or efavirenz (N=682) was 9% and 8%, respectively. Most events were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of Grades 3 and 4 depressive disorders (regardless of causality) was 1% for both rilpivirine and efavirenz. The incidence of discontinuation due to depressive disorders among rilpivirine or efavirenz was 1% in each arm. Suicidal ideation was reported in 4 subjects in each arm while suicide attempt was reported in 2 subjects in the rilpivirine arm. Patients with severe depressive symptoms should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms are related to COMPLERA, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a rilpivirine containing regimen. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C, or marked elevations in liver-associated tests prior to treatment may be at increased risk for worsening or development of liver-associated test elevations with use of COMPLERA. A few cases of hepatic toxicity have been reported in patients receiving a rilpivirine containing regimen who had no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with COMPLERA is recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C, or in patients with marked elevations in liver-associated tests prior to treatment initiation. Liver-associated test monitoring should also be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. 5.8 Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF Bone Mineral Density: In clinical trials in HIV-1-infected adults, tenofovir DF was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. For more information, please consult the VIREAD® prescribing information. The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and Vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Mineralization Defects: Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 5.9 Coadministration with Other Products COMPLERA should not be administered concurrently with other medicinal products containing the active components emtricitabine or tenofovir DF (ATRIPLA®, EMTRIVA, STRIBILD®, TRUVADA®, VIREAD), with medicinal products containing lamivudine (Epivir®, Epivir-HBV®, Epzicom®, Combivir®, Trizivir®), or with adefovir dipivoxil (HEPSERA). COMPLERA should not be administered with rilpivirine (Edurant) unless needed for dose adjustment (e.g., with rifabutin) [See Dosage and Administration (2) and Drug Interactions (7.5)]. 5.10 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.11 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including the components of COMPLERA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment."

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) identified from any of the 3 large controlled clinical trials include headache, diarrhea nausea, fatigue, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, rash, abdominal pain, asthenia, increased cough, and rhinitis. Studies 301A and 303 - Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions that occurred in subjects receiving EMTRIVA with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials 301A and 303 were headache, diarrhea, nausea, and rash, which were generally of mild to moderate severity. Approximately 1% of subjects discontinued participation in the clinical trials due to these events. All adverse reactions were reported with similar frequency in EMTRIVA and control treatment groups with the exception of skin discoloration which was reported with higher frequency in the EMTRIVA treated group. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Products with same active ingredient: Do not use with other emtricitabine-containing products (e.g., ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, STRIBILD, and TRUVADA). (5.3) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.6) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs alone or in combination, including emtricitabine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver diseases; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EMTRIVA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy. EMTRIVA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of EMTRIVA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of Hepatitis B have been reported in patients after the discontinuation of EMTRIVA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue EMTRIVA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-Hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. 5.3 Coadministration with Related Products EMTRIVA is a component of ATRIPLA (a fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), COMPLERA (a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), STRIBILD (a fixed-dose combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), and TRUVADA (a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). EMTRIVA should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, STRIBILD, or TRUVADA. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, EMTRIVA should not be coadministered with other drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). 5.4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine is principally eliminated by the kidney. Reduction of the dosage of EMTRIVA is recommended for patients with impaired renal function [See Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.5 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EMTRIVA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction trials have been conducted using TRUVADA tablets. Drug interaction trials have been conducted with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the components of TRUVADA. This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions observed with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coadministration of TRUVADA and didanosine should be undertaken with caution and patients receiving this combination should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Didanosine should be discontinued in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. When tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered with didanosine the Cmax and AUC of didanosine administered as either the buffered or enteric-coated formulation increased significantly [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis, and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir DF with didanosine 400 mg daily. In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, the didanosine dose should be reduced to 250 mg when it is coadministered with TRUVADA. Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for adult or pediatric patients weighing less than 60 kg. When coadministered, TRUVADA and Videx EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal (less than 400 kcal, 20% fat). Coadministration of didanosine buffered tablet formulation with TRUVADA should be under fasted conditions. Atazanavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving atazanavir and TRUVADA should be monitored for TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. Tenofovir decreases the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When coadministered with TRUVADA, it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg. Atazanavir without ritonavir should not be coadministered with TRUVADA. Lopinavir/ritonavir has been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir and TRUVADA should be monitored for TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. TRUVADA should be discontinued in patients who develop TRUVADA-associated adverse reactions. Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No drug-drug interactions due to competition for renal excretion have been observed; however, coadministration of TRUVADA with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and/or the coadministered drug. Some examples include, but are not limited to acyclovir, adefovir dipivoxil, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, and valganciclovir. Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine and/or tenofovir."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe Acute Exacerbations of hepatitis B [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Decreases in Bone Mineral Density [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Adult Subjects The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) occurring in Study 934, an active-controlled clinical trial of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, include diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash. See also Table 2 for the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse reactions (Grade 2–4) occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects treated in any treatment group in this trial. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms and/or soles, was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. Study 934 - Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions: In Study 934, 511 antiretroviral-naive subjects received either VIREAD + EMTRIVA administered in combination with efavirenz (N=257) or zidovudine/lamivudine administered in combination with efavirenz (N=254) for 144 weeks. Subjects had a mean age of 40 years (range 20 to 73 years) and were predominantly male (88%). Overall, 65% were White, 17% were Black, and 13% were Hispanic. Adverse reactions observed in this trial were generally consistent with those seen in other trials in treatment-experienced or treatment-naive subjects receiving VIREAD and/or EMTRIVA (Table 2).

In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above for Study 934, Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities of increased bilirubin (>2.5 × ULN), increased pancreatic amylase (>2.0 × ULN), increased or decreased serum glucose (<40 or >250 mg/dL), and increased serum lipase (>2.0 × ULN) occurred in up to 3% of subjects treated with EMTRIVA or VIREAD with other antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older Emtricitabine: In addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anemia and hyperpigmentation were observed in 7% and 32%, respectively, of pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) who received treatment with EMTRIVA in the larger of two open-label, uncontrolled pediatric trials (N=116). For additional information, please consult the EMTRIVA prescribing information. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a pediatric clinical trial conducted in subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age, the adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with VIREAD were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of VIREAD in adults [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. No new adverse reactions to TRUVADA were identified from two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (iPrEx, Partners PrEP) in which 2830 HIV-1 uninfected adults received TRUVADA once daily for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Subjects were followed for a median of 71 weeks and 87 weeks, respectively. These trials enrolled HIV-negative individuals ranging in age from 18 to 67 years. The iPrEx trial enrolled only males or transgender females of Hispanic/Latino (72%), White (18%), Black (9%) and Asian (5%) race. The Partners PrEP trial enrolled both males (61–64% across treatment groups) and females in Kenya and Uganda. Table 4 provides a list of all adverse events that occurred ≥2% of subjects in any treatment group in the iPrEx and Partners PrEP trials. Laboratory Abnormalities: Table 5 provides a list of laboratory abnormalities observed in both trials. Six subjects in the TDF-containing arms of the Partners PrEP trial discontinued participation in the study due to an increase in blood creatinine compared with no discontinuations in the placebo group. One subject in the TRUVADA arm of the iPrEx trial discontinued from the study due to an increase in blood creatinine and another due to low phosphorous. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities described above, Grade 1 proteinuria (1+) occurred in 6% of subjects receiving TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial. Grade 2–3 proteinuria (2–4+) and glycosuria (3+) occurred in less than 1% of subjects treated with TRUVADA in the iPrEx trial and Partners PrEP trial.

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CrCl) before initiating treatment with TRUVADA. Monitor CrCl and serum phosphorus in patients at risk. Avoid administering Truvada with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (5.3) Coadministration with Other Products: Do not use with drugs containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, VIREAD; or with drugs containing lamivudine. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (5.4) Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. (5.5) Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (5.7) Triple nucleoside-only regimens: Early virologic failure has been reported in HIV-infected patients. Monitor carefully and consider treatment modification. (5.8) Comprehensive management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1: Use as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy including other prevention measures; strictly adhere to dosing schedule. (5.9) Management to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 drug resistance: Prior to initiating TRUVADA for PrEP - if clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm negative HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. While using TRUVADA for PrEP - HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. (5.9) Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including VIREAD, a component of TRUVADA, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient or uninfected individual with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in HIV-1 infected patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with TRUVADA should be suspended in any patient or uninfected individual who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). It is recommended that all individuals be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating TRUVADA. TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients infected with HBV. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are infected with HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with TRUVADA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. HBV -uninfected individuals should be offered vaccination. Emtricitabine and tenofovir are principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. It is recommended that creatinine clearance be calculated in all individuals prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with TRUVADA. Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in all individuals at risk for renal impairment, including individuals who have previously experienced renal events while receiving HEPSERA. TRUVADA should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. Treatment of HIV-1 Infection Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min, [See Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received TRUVADA using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of TRUVADA therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity. TRUVADA should not be administered to patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min or patients requiring hemodialysis. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis TRUVADA for a PrEP indication should not be used if creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in creatinine clearance is observed in uninfected individuals while using TRUVADA for PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use [See Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. TRUVADA is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Do not coadminister TRUVADA with ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, or VIREAD. Due to similarities between emtricitabine and lamivudine, do not coadminister TRUVADA with other drugs containing lamivudine, including Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine), Epivir or Epivir-HBV (lamivudine), Epzicom (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine), or Trizivir (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister TRUVADA with HEPSERA® (adefovir dipivoxil). Assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) should be considered for adults and in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: In a 144-week trial of treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adult subjects, decreases in BMD were seen at the lumbar spine and hip in both arms of the trial. At Week 144, there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving VIREAD + lamivudine + efavirenz compared with subjects receiving stavudine + lamivudine + efavirenz. Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups. In both groups, the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24–48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through 144 weeks. Twenty-eight percent of VIREAD-treated subjects vs. 21% of the comparator subjects lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine or 7% of BMD at the hip. Clinically relevant fractures (excluding fingers and toes) were reported in 4 subjects in the VIREAD group and 6 subjects in the comparator group. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism (serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum osteocalcin, serum C-telopeptide, and urinary N-telopeptide), suggesting increased bone turnover. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving VIREAD. In a clinical trial of HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older (Study 321), bone effects were similar to adult subjects. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in this age group. In this trial, the mean rate of bone gain was less in the VIREAD-treated group compared to the placebo group. Six VIREAD treated subjects and one placebo treated subject had significant (greater than 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss in 48 weeks. Among 28 subjects receiving 96 weeks of VIREAD, Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. Skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected. Markers of bone turnover in VIREAD-treated pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older suggest increased bone turnover, consistent with the effects observed in adults. In clinical trials of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, decreases in BMD were observed. In the iPrEx trial, a substudy of 503 subjects found mean changes from baseline in BMD ranging from -0.4% to -1.0% across total hip, spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in the TRUVADA group compared with the placebo group, which returned toward baseline after discontinuation of treatment. Thirteen percent of subjects receiving TRUVADA vs. 6% of subjects receiving placebo lost at least 5% of BMD at the spine during treatment. Bone fractures were reported in 1.7% of the TRUVADA group compared with 1.4% in the placebo group. No correlation between BMD and fractures was noted [See Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The Partners PrEP trial found similar fracture rates between treatment and placebo groups (0.8% and 0.6%, respectively). No BMD evaluations were conducted during this trial [See Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The effects of VIREAD-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. For additional information, please consult the VIREAD prescribing information. Cases of osteomalacia (associated with proximal renal tubulopathy and which may contribute to fractures) have been reported in association with the use of VIREAD [See Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in HIV-1 infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TRUVADA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Clinical trials in HIV-1 infected subjects have demonstrated that certain regimens that only contain three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are generally less effective than triple drug regimens containing two NRTIs in combination with either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a HIV-1 protease inhibitor. In particular, early virological failure and high rates of resistance substitutions have been reported. Triple nucleoside regimens should therefore be used with caution. Patients on a therapy utilizing a triple nucleoside-only regimen should be carefully monitored and considered for treatment modification. Use TRUVADA for pre-exposure prophylaxis only as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy that includes other prevention measures, such as safer sex practices, because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1 [See Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3)]. Counsel uninfected individuals about safer sex practices that include consistent and correct use of condoms, knowledge of their HIV-1 status and that of their partner(s), and regular testing for other sexually transmitted infections that can facilitate HIV-1 transmission (such as syphilis and gonorrhea). Inform uninfected individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior. Use TRUVADA to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 only in individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative. HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are taking only TRUVADA, because TRUVADA alone does not constitute a complete treatment regimen for HIV-1 treatment [See Microbiology: Resistance (12.4)]; therefore, care should be taken to minimize drug exposure in HIV-infected individuals. Many HIV-1 tests, such as rapid tests, detect anti-HIV antibodies and may not identify HIV-1 during the acute stage of infection. Prior to initiating TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, evaluate seronegative individuals for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute viral infections (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash, etc.) and ask about potential exposure events (e.g., unprotected, or condom broke during sex with an HIV-1 infected partner) that may have occurred within the last month. If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. While using TRUVADA for a PrEP indication, HIV-1 screening tests should be repeated at least every 3 months. If symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following a potential exposure event, PrEP should be discontinued until negative infection status is confirmed using a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection. Counsel uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the recommended TRUVADA dosing schedule. The effectiveness of TRUVADA in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated with adherence as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials [See Clinical Studies (14.2 and 14.3)]."
