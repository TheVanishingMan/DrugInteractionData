        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted between Amturnide and other drugs. In a phase III sub-study, there was no clinically relevant change in the exposure of aliskiren, amlodipine, and HCTZ observed with Amturnide compared to the dual combinations of aliskiren and amlodipine, amlodipine and HCTZ, and aliskiren and HCTZ. Studies with the individual aliskiren, amlodipine, and HCTZ components are described below. Aliskiren Cyclosporine: Avoid coadministration of cyclosporine with aliskiren [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Itraconazole: Avoid coadministration of itraconazole with aliskiren [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors with agents that affect the RAAS, including aliskiren, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving aliskiren and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of aliskiren may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS): The concomitant use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS such as ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with CrCl less than 60 mL/min. Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on aliskiren and other agents that affect the RAAS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6, 5.9)]. The concomitant use of aliskiren with an ARB or an ACEI in diabetic patients is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Furosemide: Oral coadministration of aliskiren and furosemide reduced exposure to furosemide. Monitor diuretic effects when furosemide is coadministered with aliskiren. Amlodipine Simvastatin: Coadministration of simvastatin with amlodipine increases the systemic exposure of simvastatin. Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on amlodipine to 20 mg daily. CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors (moderate and strong) result in increased systemic exposure to amlodipine warranting dose reduction. Monitor for symptoms of hypotension and edema when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors to determine the need for dose adjustment. CYP3A4 Inducers: No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be monitored when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inducers. HCTZ When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin): Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Lithium: Diuretic agents increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended during concomitant use. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and COX-2 selective agents: When Amturnide and NSAIDs are used concomitantly, observe the patient to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Ion-exchange Resins: Staggering the dosage of HCTZ and resin (e.g., cholestyramine, colestipol) such that HCTZ is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of resins would potentially minimize the interaction [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cyclosporine or Itraconazole: Avoid concomitant use (5.10, 7, 12.3) Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. (7) Simvastatin: Avoid doses greater than 20 mg daily. (7) Antidiabetic Drugs: Antidiabetic dosage adjustment may be required. (7) Cholestyramine and Colestipol: Reduce absorption of thiazides. (7) Lithium: Increased risk of lithium toxicity when used with diuretics.(7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events (incidence â‰¥2%) are: peripheral edema, dizziness, headache and nasopharyngitis. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Anaphylactic Reactions and Head and Neck Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Amturnide Amturnide has been evaluated for safety in 1155 patients treated with Amturnide, including 182 patients for over 1 year. In a short-term controlled trial, there were 60.5% males, 84.1% Caucasians, 10% blacks, 6.4% Hispanics, and 19.1% who were 65 years of age and older. In this study, the overall incidence of adverse events on therapy with Amturnide was similar to that observed with the individual components. The overall frequency of adverse events was similar between men and women and black and Caucasian patients. Discontinuation of therapy because of a clinical adverse event in this study occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with Amturnide versus 2.4% in aliskiren/amlodipine, 0.7% in aliskiren/HCTZ, and 2.7% in amlodipine/HCTZ. Table 1. Adverse Events in a Short-term Controlled Trial that Occurred in at Least 2% of Patients Treated with Amturnide Amturnide Ali/amlo Ali/HCTZ Amlo/HCTZ Edema peripheral 7.1% 8.0% 2.0% 4.1% Dizziness 3.6% 2.4% 3.4% 1.7% Headache 3.6% 3.1% 4.0% 5.1% Nasopharyngitis 2.6% 0.7% 2.0% 3.4% In a long-term safety trial, the safety profile was similar to that seen in the short-term controlled trial. Aliskiren Aliskiren has been evaluated for safety in 6460 patients, including 1740 treated for longer than 6 months, and 1250 for longer than 1 year. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy because of a clinical adverse event, including uncontrolled hypertension, occurred in 2.2% of patients treated with aliskiren, versus 3.5% of patients given placebo. These data do not include information from the ALTITUDE study which evaluated the use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Two cases of angioedema with respiratory symptoms were reported with aliskiren use in the clinical studies. Two other cases of periorbital edema without respiratory symptoms were reported as possible angioedema and resulted in discontinuation. The rate of these angioedema cases in the completed studies was 0.06%. In addition, 26 other cases of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body were reported with aliskiren use, including 4 leading to discontinuation. In the placebo-controlled studies, however, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body was 0.4% with aliskiren compared with 0.5% with placebo. In a long-term active-controlled study with aliskiren and HCTZ arms, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body was 0.4% in both treatment arms. Aliskiren produces dose-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions. Diarrhea was reported by 2.3% of patients at 300 mg, compared to 1.2% in placebo patients. In women and the elderly (age 65 years and older) increases in diarrhea rates were evident starting at a dose of 150 mg daily, with rates for these subgroups at 150 mg similar to those seen at 300 mg for men or younger patients (all rates about 2%). Other GI symptoms included abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux, although increased rates for abdominal pain and dyspepsia were distinguished from placebo only at 600 mg daily. Diarrhea and other GI symptoms were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation. Aliskiren was associated with a slight increase in cough in the placebo-controlled studies (1.1% for any aliskiren use versus 0.6% for placebo). In active-controlled trials with ACE inhibitor (ramipril, lisinopril) arms, the rates of cough for the aliskiren arms were about one-third to one-half the rates in the ACE inhibitor arms. Other adverse reactions with increased rates for aliskiren compared to placebo included rash (1% versus 0.3%), and renal stones (0.2% versus 0%). Single episodes of tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness were reported in 2 patients treated with aliskiren in the clinical trials. One patient had predisposing causes for seizures and had a negative electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral imaging following the seizures; for the other patient, EEG and imaging results were not reported. Aliskiren was discontinued and there was no re-challenge in either case. No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with aliskiren. Amlodipine Amlodipine (NorvascÂ®) has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. Other adverse events that have been reported at less than 1% but greater than 0.1% of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain were: Cardiovascular: arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, vasculitis Central and Peripheral Nervous System: neuropathy peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia General: allergic reaction, asthenia,** back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps,** myalgia Psychiatric: sexual dysfunction (male** and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization Respiratory System: dyspnea, epistaxis Skin and Appendages: angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus,** rash,** rash erythematous, rash maculopapular **These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies. Special Senses: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus Urinary System: micturition frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth, sweating increased Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, thirst Hemopoietic : leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia Other events reported with amlodipine at a frequency of less than or equal to 0.1% of patients include: cardiac failure, pulse irregularity, extrasystoles, skin discoloration, urticaria, skin dryness, alopecia, dermatitis, muscle weakness, twitching, ataxia, hypertonia, migraine, cold and clammy skin, apathy, agitation, amnesia, gastritis, increased appetite, loose stools, rhinitis, dysuria, polyuria, parosmia, taste perversion, abnormal visual accommodation, and xerophthalmia. Other reactions occurred sporadically and cannot be distinguished from medications or concurrent disease states such as myocardial infarction and angina. HCTZ Other adverse reactions not listed above that have been reported with HCTZ, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body as a Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic : aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia Hypersensitivity: photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Clinical Laboratory Test Abnormalities Clinical laboratory findings for Amturnide in patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI were obtained in a controlled trial of Amturnide administered at the maximal dose of 300/10/25 mg compared to maximal doses of dual therapies, i.e., aliskiren/amlodipine 300/10 mg, aliskiren/HCTZ 300/25 mg and amlodipine/HCTZ 10/25 mg. RBC Count, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit Small mean changes from baseline were seen in RBC count, hemoglobin and hematocrit in patients treated with Amturnide. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin angiotensin system. In aliskiren monotherapy trials, these decreases led to slight increases in rates of anemia compared to placebo (0.1% for any aliskiren use, 0.3% for aliskiren 600 mg daily, versus 0% for placebo). No patients discontinued Amturnide because of anemia. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)/Creatinine No patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI treated with Amturnide had elevations in BUN greater 40 mg/dL or creatinine greater 2.0 mg/dL. Liver Function Tests Occasional elevations (greater than 150% from baseline) in ALT (SGPT) were observed in 2.7% of patients treated with Amturnide, compared with 1.7% to 2.7% in patients treated with the dual combinations. No patients were discontinued due to abnormal liver function tests. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of either aliskiren, amlodipine or HCTZ. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Aliskiren: Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reactions and angioedema requiring airway management and hospitalization. Peripheral edema, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria, hepatic enzyme increase with clinical symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, pruritus, erythema, nausea, vomiting. Amlodipine: The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ): Acute renal failure, renal disorder, aplastic anemia, erythema multiforme, pyrexia, muscle spasm, asthenia, acute angle-closure glaucoma, bone marrow failure, worsening of diabetes control, hypokalemia, blood lipids increased, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hyperchloremic alkalosis, impotence, visual impairment. Pathological changes in the parathyroid gland of patients with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy. If hypercalcemia occurs, further diagnostic evaluation is necessary."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Avoid concomitant use with ARBs or ACEIs particularly in patients with renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) <60 mL/min]. (5.2, 5.4) Anaphylactic Reactions and Head and Neck Angioedema.(5.3) Hypotension: Correct imbalances in volume and/or salt-depleted patients.(5.4) Increased angina or myocardial infarction may occur upon dosage initiation or increase in amlodipine. (5.5) Impaired Renal Function: Monitor serum creatinine periodically. (5.6) Systemic lupus erythematosus activation or exacerbation. (5.8) Hyperkalemia: Monitor potassium levels periodically. (5.9) Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle Closure Glaucoma. (5.11) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Amturnide as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possible other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Renal Impairment/Hyperkalemia/Hypotension when Amturnide is Given in Combination with ARBs or ACEIs Amturnide is contraindicated in patients with diabetes who are receiving ARBs or ACEIs because of the increased risk of renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 60 mL/min [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 5.3 Anaphylactic Reactions and Head and Neck Angioedema Aliskiren Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylactic reactions and angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren and has necessitated hospitalization and intubation. This may occur at any time during treatment and has occurred in patients with and without a history of angioedema with ACEIs or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported from postmarketing experience with unknown frequency. If angioedema involves the throat, tongue, glottis or larynx, or if the patient has a history of upper respiratory surgery, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who experience these effects, even without respiratory distress, require prolonged observation and appropriate monitoring measures since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient to prevent respiratory involvement. Prompt administration of subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and measures to ensure a patent airway may be necessary. Discontinue Amturnide immediately in patients who develop anaphylactic reactions or angioedema, and do not re-administer [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Hypotension Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Amturnide in patients with marked volume depletion, patients with salt depletion, or with combined use of aliskiren and other agents acting on the RAAS. The volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Amturnide, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. Amlodipine besylate Symptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely. 5.5 Risk of Myocardial Infarction or Increased Angina Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. 5.6 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with Amturnide. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that affect the RAAS and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the RAAS (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or patients receiving ARB, ACEI, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), therapy may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on Amturnide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on Amturnide [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) Hypersensitivity reactions to HCTZ may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.8 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 5.9 Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities Amturnide In a short-term controlled trial the incidence of patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5 mEq/L) was 11.0% of Amturnide-treated patients compared to 19.0% of amlodipine/HCTZ patients, 4.4% of aliskiren/HCTZ patients, and 2.1% of aliskiren/amlodipine patients; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L) was 3.0% compared to 2.0% of amlodipine/HCTZ patients, 0.7% of aliskiren/HCTZ patients, and 0.7% of aliskiren/amlodipine patients. No Amturnide-treated patients discontinued due to increase or decrease of serum potassium. Aliskiren Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving aliskiren. Drugs that affect the RAAS can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes, combination use with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.2)], NSAIDs, or potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) HCTZ can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Amturnide should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides. 5.10 Cyclosporine or Itraconazole When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine or itraconazole, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Avoid concomitant use of Amturnide with cyclosporine or itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.11 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma HCTZ, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue HCTZ as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. 5.12 Metabolic Disturbances Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. HCTZ may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients. HCTZ decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevation of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving Amturnide."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence â‰¥1.5% and more common than with placebo) are: dizziness and diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Anaphylactic Reactions and Head and Neck Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tekturna HCT Tekturna HCT has been evaluated for safety in more than 2,700 patients, including over 700 treated for 6 months and 190 for over 1 year. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event (including uncontrolled hypertension) occurred in 2.7% of patients treated with Tekturna HCT versus 3.6% of patients given placebo. Adverse events in placebo-controlled trials that occurred in at least 1% of patients treated with Tekturna HCT and at a higher incidence than placebo included dizziness (2.3% versus 1%), influenza (2.3% versus 1.6%), diarrhea (1.6% versus 0.5%), cough (1.3% versus 0.5%), vertigo (1.2% versus 0.5%), asthenia (1.2% versus 0%), and arthralgia (1% versus 0.5%). Aliskiren Aliskiren has been evaluated for safety in 6,460 patients, including 1,740 treated for longer than 6 months, and 1,250 for longer than 1 year. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event, including uncontrolled hypertension occurred in 2.2% of patients treated with aliskiren, versus 3.5% of patients given placebo. These data do not include information from the ALTITUDE study which evaluated the use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Two cases of angioedema with respiratory symptoms were reported with aliskiren use in the clinical studies. Two other cases of periorbital edema without respiratory symptoms were reported as possible angioedema and resulted in discontinuation. The rate of these angioedema cases in the completed studies was 0.06%. In addition, 26 other cases of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body were reported with aliskiren use, including 4 leading to discontinuation. In the placebo-controlled studies, however, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body was 0.4% with aliskiren compared with 0.5% with placebo. In a long-term active-controlled study with aliskiren and HCTZ arms, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body was 0.4% in both treatment arms. Aliskiren produces dose-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions. Diarrhea was reported by 2.3% of patients at 300 mg, compared to 1.2% in placebo patients. In women and the elderly (age 65 years and older) increases in diarrhea rates were evident starting at a dose of 150 mg daily, with rates for these subgroups at 150 mg comparable to those seen at 300 mg for men or younger patients (all rates about 2% to 2.3%). Other GI symptoms included abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux, although increased rates for abdominal pain and dyspepsia were distinguished from placebo only at 600 mg daily. Diarrhea and other GI symptoms were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation. Aliskiren was associated with a slight increase in cough in the placebo-controlled studies (1.1% for any aliskiren use versus 0.6% for placebo).

Aliskiren was discontinued and there was no rechallenge in either case. No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with aliskiren. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) Other adverse reactions that have been reported with HCTZ, without regard to causality, are listed below: Body As A Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia; Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia Clinical Laboratory Test Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of Tekturna HCT in patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)/Creatinine: In patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, elevations (greater than 50% increase) in BUN and creatinine occurred in 11.8% and 0.9%, respectively, of patients taking Tekturna HCT, and 7% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients given placebo in short-term controlled clinical trials. No patients were discontinued due to an increase in either BUN or creatinine. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: A greater than 20% decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed in <0.1% and 0.1%, respectively, of patients treated with Tekturna HCT, compared with 0% in placebo-treated patients. No patients were discontinued due to anemia. Liver Function Tests: Occasional elevations (greater than 150%) in ALT (SGPT) were observed in 1.2% of patients treated with Tekturna HCT, compared with 0% in placebo-treated patients. No patients were discontinued due to abnormal liver function tests. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide post-marketing experience. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Aliskiren Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reactions and angioedema requiring airway management and hospitalization, urticaria, peripheral edema, hepatic enzyme increase with clinical symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, pruritus, erythema, nausea, vomiting Hydrochlorothiazide Acute renal failure, renal disorder, aplastic anemia, erythema mutliforme, pyrexia, muscle spasm, asthenia, acute angle-closure glaucoma, bone marrow failure, worsening of diabetes control, hypokalemia, blood lipids increased, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hyperchloremic alkalosis, impotence, visual impairment Pathological changes in the parathyroid gland of patients with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy. If hypercalcemia occurs, further diagnostic evaluation is necessary."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Avoid concomitant use with ARBs or ACEIs particularly in patients with renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) <60 mL/min]. (5.2, 5.4) Anaphylactic Reactions and Angioedema. (5.3) Hypotension: Correct imbalances in volume and/or salt-depleted patients. (5.4) Impaired Renal Function: Monitor serum creatinine periodically. (5.5) Hyperkalemia: Monitor potassium levels periodically. (5.8) Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle Closure Glaucoma. (5.10) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Tekturna HCT as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possible other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Renal Impairment/Hyperkalemia/Hypotension when Tekturna HCT is Given in Combination with ARBs or ACEIs Tekturna HCT is contraindicated in patients with diabetes who are receiving ARBs or ACEIs because of the increased risk of renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 60 mL/min [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. 5.3 Anaphylactic Reactions and Head and Neck Angioedema Aliskiren Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylactic reactions and angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx have been reported in patients treated with Tekturna and has necessitated hospitalization and intubation. This may occur at any time during treatment and has occurred in patients with and without a history of angioedema with ACEIs or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported from postmarketing experience with unknown frequency. If angioedema involves the throat, tongue, glottis or larynx, or if the patient has a history of upper respiratory surgery, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who experience these effects, even without respiratory distress, require prolonged observation and appropriate monitoring measures since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient to prevent respiratory involvement. Prompt administration of subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and measures to ensure a patent airway may be necessary. Discontinue Tekturna HCT immediately in patients who develop anaphylactic reactions or angioedema, and do not readminister [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Hypotension Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Tekturna HCT in patients with marked volume depletion, patients with salt depletion, or with combined use of aliskiren and other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Tekturna HCT, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.5 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with Tekturna HCT. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that affect the RAAS and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the RAAS (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or patients receiving ARB, ACEI or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) , including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), therapy may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on Tekturna HCT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on Tekturna HCT. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) Hypersensitivity reactions to HCTZ may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.7 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities Tekturna HCT In the short-term controlled trials of various doses of Tekturna HCT, in patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5 mEq/L) was 2.2%; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L) was 0.8%. No patients discontinued due to increase or decrease of serum potassium. Aliskiren Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving aliskiren. Drugs that affect the RAAS can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes, combination use with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.4)], NSAIDs, including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors) ,or potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) HCTZ can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Tekturna HCT should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides. 5.9 Cyclosporine or Itraconazole Aliskiren When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine or itraconazole, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine or itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.10 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma HCTZ, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue HCTZ as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. 5.11 Metabolic Disturbances Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) HCTZ may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. HCTZ may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients. HCTZ decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving Tekturna HCT."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted with Tekturna HCT and other drugs, although studies with the individual aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide components are described below. Aliskiren Effects of Other Drugs on Aliskiren Based on in vitro studies, aliskiren is metabolized by CYP 3A4. Irbesartan: Coadministration of irbesartan reduced aliskiren Cmax up to 50% after multiple dosing. P-glycoprotein Effects: Pgp (MDR1/Mdr1a/1b) was found to be the major efflux system involved in absorption and disposition of aliskiren in preclinical studies. The potential for drug interactions at the Pgp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. Coadministration of aliskiren with Pgp substrates or weak to moderate inhibitors such as atenolol, digoxin, and amlodipine did not result in clinically relevant interactions. Atorvastatin: Coadministration of atorvastatin, a weak Pgp inhibitor, resulted in about a 50% increase in aliskiren Cmax and AUC after multiple dosing. Ketoconazole: Coadministration of 200 mg twice-daily ketoconazole, a moderate Pgp inhibitor, with aliskiren resulted in an approximate 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren. A 400-mg once-daily dose was not studied but would be expected to increase aliskiren blood levels further. Cyclosporine: Coadministration of 200 mg and 600 mg cyclosporine, a potent Pgp inhibitor, with 75 mg aliskiren resulted in an approximately 2.5-fold increase in Cmax and 5-fold increase in AUC of aliskiren. Concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine is not recommended. Verapamil: Coadministration of 240 mg of verapamil, a moderate Pgp inhibitor, with 300 mg aliskiren resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in Cmax and AUC of aliskiren. However, no dosage adjustment is necessary. Drugs with no clinically significant effects: Coadministration of lovastatin, atenolol, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, celecoxib, hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, valsartan, metformin and amlodipine did not result in clinically significant increases in aliskiren exposure. Effects of Aliskiren on Other Drugs Aliskiren does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and CYP 3A) or induce CYP 3A4. Furosemide: When aliskiren was coadministered with furosemide, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by about 30% and 50%, respectively. Patients receiving furosemide could find its effect diminished after starting aliskiren. Drugs with no clinically significant effects: Coadministration of aliskiren did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin, digoxin, valsartan, amlodipine, metformin, celecoxib, atenolol, atorvastatin, ramipril or hydrochlorothiazide. Warfarin : The effects of aliskiren on warfarin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated. Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics : Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin ) : Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other antihypertensive drugs : Additive effect or potentiation. Cholestyramine and colestipol resins : Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH : Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia. Pressor amines (e.g., norepinephrine ) : Possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine ) : Possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxants. Lithium : Should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium before use of such preparation with Tekturna HCT. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory d rugs : In some patients, the administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when Tekturna HCT and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Aliskiren: Cyclosporine: Concomitant use is not recommended. Hydrochlorothiazide: Alcohol, Barbiturates, Narcotics: Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension Antidiabetic Drugs: Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic may be required Cholestyramine and Colestipol: Reduced absorption of thiazides Corticosteroids, ACTH: Hypokalemia, electrolyte depletion Lithium: Reduced renal clearance and high risk of lithium toxicity when used with diuretics. Should not be given with diuretics. NSAIDs: Can reduce diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics. Observe patient closely."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence â‰¥1.5% and more common than with placebo) are: dizziness and diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Risk of fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality [ s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Head and neck angioedema [ s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hypotension in volume- and/or salt-depleted patients [ s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tekturna HCT Tekturna HCT has been evaluated for safety in more than 2,700 patients, including over 700 treated for 6 months and 190 for over 1 year. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event (including uncontrolled hypertension) occurred in 2.7% of patients treated with Tekturna HCT versus 3.6% of patients given placebo. Adverse events in placebo-controlled trials that occurred in at least 1% of patients treated with Tekturna HCT and at a higher incidence than placebo included dizziness (2.3% vs. 1%), influenza (2.3% vs. 1.6%), diarrhea (1.6% vs. 0.5%), cough (1.3% vs. 0.5%), vertigo (1.2% vs. 0.5%), asthenia (1.2% vs. 0%), and arthralgia (1% vs. 0.5%). A liskiren Aliskiren has been evaluated for safety in 6,460 patients, including 1,740 treated for longer than 6 months, and 1,250 for longer than 1 year. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event, including uncontrolled hypertension occurred in 2.2% of patients treated with aliskiren, versus 3.5% of patients given placebo. Two cases of angioedema with respiratory symptoms were reported with aliskiren use in the clinical studies. Two other cases of periorbital edema without respiratory symptoms were reported as possible angioedema and resulted in discontinuation. The rate of these angioedema cases in the completed studies was 0.06%. In addition, 26 other cases of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body were reported with aliskiren use, including 4 leading to discontinuation. In the placebo-controlled studies, however, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body was 0.4% with aliskiren compared with 0.5% with placebo. In a long-term active-controlled study with aliskiren and HCTZ arms, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body was 0.4% in both treatment arms. Aliskiren produces dose-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions. Diarrhea was reported by 2.3% of patients at 300 mg, compared to 1.2% in placebo patients. In women and the elderly (age â‰¥65) increases in diarrhea rates were evident starting at a dose of 150 mg daily, with rates for these subgroups at 150 mg comparable to those seen at 300 mg for men or younger patients (all rates about 2% to 2.3%). Other GI symptoms included abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux, although increased rates for abdominal pain and dyspepsia were distinguished from placebo only at 600 mg daily. Diarrhea and other GI symptoms were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation. Aliskiren was associated with a slight increase in cough in the placebo-controlled studies (1.1% for any aliskiren use vs. 0.6% for placebo). In active-controlled trials with ACE inhibitor (ramipril, lisinopril) arms, the rates of cough for the aliskiren arms were about one-third to one-half the rates in the ACE inhibitor arms. Other adverse reactions with increased rates for aliskiren compared to placebo included rash (1% vs. 0.3%), elevated uric acid (0.4% vs. 0.1%), gout (0.2% vs. 0.1%), and renal stones (0.2% vs. 0%). Single episodes of tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness were reported in two patients treated with aliskiren in the clinical trials. One patient had predisposing causes for seizures and had a negative electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral imaging following the seizures; for the other patient, EEG and imaging results were not reported. Aliskiren was discontinued and there was no rechallenge in either case. The following adverse events occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with aliskiren, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: headache, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain and cough. No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with aliskiren. H ydrochlorothiazide Other adverse reactions that have been reported with hydrochlorothiazide, without regard to causality, are listed below: B ody As A Whole: weakness Digestive: pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, gastric irritation Hematologic: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia; Hypersensitivity: purpura, photosensitivity, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic reactions Metabolic: hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia Musculoskeletal: muscle spasm Nervous System/Psychiatric: restlessness Renal: renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis Skin: erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses: transient blurred vision, xanthopsia 6.2 Clinical Laboratory Test Abnormalities In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with administration of Tekturna HCT. B lood Urea N itrogen (BUN)/Creatinine: Elevations (greater than 50% increase) in BUN and creatinine occurred in 11.8% and 0.9%, respectively, of patients taking Tekturna HCT, and 7% and 1.1%, respectively, of patients given placebo in short-term controlled clinical trials. No patients were discontinued due to an increase in either BUN or creatinine. H emoglobin and Hematocrit: A greater than 20% decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit were observed in <0.1% and 0.1%, respectively, of patients treated with Tekturna HCT, compared with 0% in placebo-treated patients. No patients were discontinued due to anemia. L iver Function T ests: Occasional elevations (greater than 150%) in ALT (SGPT) were observed in 1.2% of patients treated with Tekturna HCT, compared with 0% in placebo-treated patients. No patients were discontinued due to abnormal liver function tests. S erum Uric Acid: Uric acid related abnormalities were more commonly observed in patients treated with Tekturna HCT, compared with placebo; 2.2% versus 0% had a uric acid increase >50% from baseline; gout and renal stones were less commonly observed. S erum Electrolytes: [ See Warnings and Precautions (5. 8).] 6.3 Post- M arketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in aliskiren post-marketing experience. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity: angioedema requiring airway management and hospitalization Peripheral edema"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Head and Neck Angioedema: Discontinue Tekturna HCT and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. (5.2) Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients: Correct imbalances before initiating therapy with Tekturna HCT. (5.3) Patients with Severe Renal Impairment: Not recommended if GFR <30 mL/min. (5.4) Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Titrate slowly. (5.5) Hypersensitivity Reactions: May occur from HCTZ component (5.6) 5.1 Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality Tekturna HCT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] In several dozen published cases, ACE inhibitors use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death. In addition, first trimester use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with birth defects. Thiazides cross the placenta, and use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possible other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults. 5.2 Head and Neck Angioedema Aliskiren Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with Tekturna and has necessitated hospitalization and intubation. This may occur at any time during treatment and has occurred in patients with and without a history of angioedema with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. If angioedema involves the throat, tongue, glottis or larynx, or if the patient has a history of upper respiratory surgery, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who experience these effects, even without respiratory distress, require prolonged observation since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient to prevent respiratory involvement. Prompt administration of subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 ml) and measures to ensure a patient airway may be necessary. Discontinue Tekturna immediately in patients who develop angioedema, and do not readminister. 5. 3 Hypotension in Volume- and/or Salt-Depleted Patients An excessive fall in blood pressure (hypotension) was rarely seen (<1%) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with Tekturna HCT in controlled trials. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Correct these conditions prior to administration of Tekturna HCT, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision. If an excessive fall in blood pressure occurs, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.4 Patients with Severe Renal Impairment Tekturna HCT In patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min), loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so Tekturna HCT is not recommended. H ydrochlorothiazide Uptitrate slowly;in patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. 5. 5 Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hydrochlorothiazide Uptitrate slowly; minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. 5. 6 Hypersensitivity Reaction s Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5. 7 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5. 8 Lithium Interaction Hydrochlorothiazide Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides [ see Drug Interaction (7) ]. 5. 9 Serum Electrolyte Abnormalitie s Tekturna HCT In the short-term controlled trials of various doses of Tekturna HCT the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L) was 2.2%; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.5 mEq/L) was 0.8%. No patients discontinued due to increase or decrease of serum potassium. Periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. The intervals should be based on the history of electrolyte abnormalities in patients with aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. Based on experience with the use of other substances that affect the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), concomitant use of Tekturna HCT with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that increase potassium levels may lead to increases in serum potassium. 5.10 Renal Artery Stenosis No data are available on the use of Tekturna HCT in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. 5.11 Cyclosporine Aliskiren When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7)]."

Data described below reflect the evaluation of the safety of Tekturna in more than 6,460 patients, including over 1,740 treated for longer than 6 months, and more than 1,250 patients for longer than 1 year. In placebo controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event, including uncontrolled hypertension occurred in 2.2% of patients treated with Tekturna vs. 3.5% of patients given placebo. Angioedema: Two cases of angioedema with respiratory symptoms were reported with Tekturna use in the clinical studies. Two other cases of periorbital edema without respiratory symptoms were reported as possible angioedema and resulted in discontinuation.

In a long term active control study with Tekturna and HCTZ arms, the incidence of edema involving the face, hand or whole body was 0.4% in both treatment arms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Gastrointestinal: Tekturna produces dose-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions. Diarrhea was reported by 2.3% of patients at 300 mg, compared to 1.2% in placebo patients. In women and the elderly (age â‰¥ 65) increases in diarrhea rates were evident starting at a dose of 150 mg daily, with rates for these subgroups at 150 mg comparable to those seen at 300 mg for men or younger patients (all rates about 2.0-2.3%). Other GI symptoms included abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux, although increased rates for abdominal pain and dyspepsia were distinguished from placebo only at 600 mg daily. Diarrhea and other GI symptoms were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation. Cough: Tekturna was associated with a slight increase in cough in the placebo-controlled studies (1.1% for any Tekturna use vs. 0.6% for placebo). In active-controlled trials with ACE inhibitor (ramipril, lisinopril) arms the rates of cough for the Tekturna arms were about one-third to one-half the rates in the ACE inhibitor arms. Seizures: Single episodes of tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness were reported in two patients treated with Tekturna in the clinical trials. One of these patients did have predisposing causes for seizures and had a negative electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral imaging following the seizures (for the other patient EEG and imaging results were not reported). Tekturna was discontinued and there was no re-challenge. The following adverse events occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Tekturna, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: headache, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain and cough. Other adverse effects with increased rates for Tekturna compared to placebo included rash (1% vs. 0.3%), elevated uric acid (0.4% vs. 0.1%), gout (0.2% vs. 0.1%) and renal stones (0.2% vs. 0%). Aliskirenâ€™s effect on ECG intervals was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled (moxifloxacin), 7-day repeat dosing study with Holter-monitoring and 12 lead ECGs throughout the interdosing interval. No effect of aliskiren on QT interval was seen. Clinical Laboratory Findings In controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with the administration of Tekturna. In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, Tekturna had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, HDL, fasting triglycerides, fasting glucose, or uric acid. Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 7% of patients with essential hypertension treated with Tekturna alone vs. 6% on placebo. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.08 g/dL and 0.16 volume percent, respectively, for all aliskiren monotherapy) were observed. The decreases were dose-related and were 0.24 g/dL and 0.79 volume percent for 600 mg daily. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin angiotensin system, such as angiotensin inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers and may be mediated by reduction of angiotensin II which stimulates erythropoetin production via the AT1 receptor. These decreases led to slight increases in rates of anemia with aliskiren compared to placebo were observed (0.1% for any aliskiren use, 0.3% for aliskiren 600 mg daily, vs 0% for placebo). No patients discontinued therapy due to anemia. Serum Potassium: Increases in serum potassium >5.5 mEq/L were infrequent in patients with essential hypertension treated with Tekturna alone (0.9% compared to 0.6% with placebo). However, when used in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in a diabetic population increases in serum potassium were more frequent (5.5%) and routine monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is indicated in this population. Serum Uric Acid: Aliskiren monotherapy produced small median increases in serum uric acid levels (about 6 Î¼mol/L) while HCTZ produced larger increases (about 30 Î¼mol/L). The combination of aliskiren with HCTZ appears to be additive (about 40 Î¼mol/L increase). The increases in uric acid appear to lead to slight increases in uric acid-related AEs: elevated uric acid (0.4% vs 0.1%), gout (0.2% vs. 0.1%), and renal stones (0.2% vs 0%). Creatine Kinase: Increases in creatine kinase of >300% were recorded in about 1% of aliskiren monotherapy patients vs. 0.5% of placebo patients. Five cases of creatine kinase rises, three leading to discontinuation and one diagnosed as subclinical rhabdomyolysis, and another as myositis, were reported as adverse events with aliskiren use in the clinical trials. No cases were associated with renal dysfunction. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in aliskiren post-marketing experience. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity: angioedema requiring airway management and hospitalization Peripheral edema Blood creatinine increased"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Avoid neonatal/fetal exposure (5.1) Head and neck angioedema. Discontinue use of Tekturna and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve (5.2) Hypotension in volume and/or salt depleted patients: Correct imbalances before initiating therapy with Tekturna (5.3) Patients with severe renal dysfunction: Consider periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalances (5.4) Hyperkalemia: Caution should be exercised when co-administered with ACEI, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or other potassium containing salt substitutes (5.5) 5.1 Fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. In several dozen published cases, ACE inhibitor use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death. In addition, first trimester use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with birth defects in retrospective data. 5.2 Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with Tekturna and has necessitated hospitalization and intubation. This may occur at any time during treatment and has occurred in patients with and without a history of angioedema with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. If angioedema involves the throat, tongue, glottis or larynx, or if the patient has a history of upper respiratory surgery, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who experience these effects, even without respiratory distress, require prolonged observation since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient to prevent respiratory involvement. Prompt administration of subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 ml) and measures to ensure a patent airway may be necessary. Discontinue Tekturna immediately in patients who develop angioedema, and do not readminister. 5.3 Hypotension An excessive fall in blood pressure was rarely seen (0.1%) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with Tekturna alone in controlled trials and in <1% during combination therapy with other antihypertensive agents. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those receiving high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Tekturna. This condition should be corrected prior to administration of Tekturna, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision. If an excessive fall in blood pressure occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.4 Impaired Renal Function Patients with greater than moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine 1.7 mg/dL for women and 2.0 mg/dL for men and/or estimated GFR <30 ml/min), a history of dialysis, nephrotic syndrome, or renovascular hypertension were excluded from clinical trials of Tekturna in hypertension. Consider periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalances particularly in patients with severe renal impairment. 5.5 Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium >5.5 mEq/L were infrequent with Tekturna alone (0.9% compared to 0.6% with placebo). However, when used in combination with an ACE inhibitor in a diabetic population, increases in serum potassium were more frequent (5.5%). Routine monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is indicated in this population. Concomitant use of Tekturna with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that increase potassium levels may lead to increases in serum potassium. 5.6 Renal Artery Stenosis No data are available on the use of Tekturna in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. 5.7 Cyclosporine or Itraconazole When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine or itraconazole, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine or itraconazole [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted with Tekamlo and other drugs, although studies with the individual aliskiren and amlodipine besylate components are described below. Aliskiren Cyclosporine: Avoid coadministration of cyclosporine with aliskiren [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Itraconazole: Avoid coadministration of itraconazole with aliskiren [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors with agents that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, including aliskiren, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving aliskiren and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of aliskiren may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS): The concomitant use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS such as ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with CrCl less than 60 mL/min. Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on aliskiren and other agents that affect the RAAS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6, 5.8)]. The concomitant use of aliskiren with an ARB or an ACEI in diabetic patients is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Furosemide: Oral coadministration of aliskiren and furosemide reduced exposure to furosemide. Monitor diuretic effects when furosemide is coadministered with aliskiren. Amlodipine besylate Simvastatin: Coadministration of simvastatin with amlodipine increases the systemic exposure of simvastatin. Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on amlodipine to 20 mg daily. CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors (moderate and strong) result in increased systemic exposure to amlodipine warranting dose reduction. Monitor for symptoms of hypotension and edema when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors to determine the need for dose adjustment. CYP3A4 Inducers: No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be monitored when amlodipine is coadministered with CYP3A4 inducers. Cyclosporine or Itraconazole: Avoid concomitant use. (5.7, 7, 12.3) Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. (7) Simvastatin: Avoid doses greater than 20 mg daily.(7)"

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse event (incidence â‰¥2% and more common than with placebo) is peripheral edema. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Anaphylactic Reactions and Head and Neck Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Tekamlo Tekamlo has been evaluated for safety in more than 2800 patients, including 372 patients for 1 year or longer. In a placebo-controlled study, there were 51% males, 62% Caucasians, 20% blacks, 18% Hispanics, and 17% who were over 65 years of age. In this study, the overall incidence of adverse events on therapy with Tekamlo was similar to the individual components. Discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event in this study occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with Tekamlo (2.2% in the highest dose group) versus 1.5% of patients given placebo. Peripheral edema is a known, dose-dependent adverse effect of amlodipine. The incidence of peripheral edema for Tekamlo in short-term double-blind placebo-controlled studies was lower than or equal to that of the corresponding amlodipine doses. The adverse event in a placebo-controlled trial that occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with Tekamlo and at a higher incidence than placebo was peripheral edema (6.2% versus 1.0%). The incidence rate of peripheral edema at high dose was 8.9%. In a long-term safety trial, the safety profile of adverse events was similar to that seen in the short-term controlled trials. Aliskiren Aliskiren has been evaluated for safety in 6460 patients, including 1740 treated for longer than 6 months, and 1250 for longer than 1 year. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy because of a clinical adverse event, including uncontrolled hypertension, occurred in 2.2% of patients treated with aliskiren versus 3.5% of patients given placebo. These data do not include information from the ALTITUDE study which evaluated the use of aliskiren in combination with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Two cases of angioedema with respiratory symptoms were reported with aliskiren use in the clinical studies. Two other cases of periorbital edema without respiratory symptoms were reported as possible angioedema and resulted in discontinuation. The rate of these angioedema cases in the completed studies was 0.06%. In addition, 26 other cases of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body were reported with aliskiren use, including 4 leading to discontinuation. In the placebo-controlled studies, however, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body was 0.4% with aliskiren compared with 0.5% with placebo. In a long-term active-controlled study with aliskiren and HCTZ arms, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body was 0.4% in both treatment arms. Aliskiren produces dose-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions. Diarrhea was reported by 2.3% of patients at 300 mg, compared to 1.2% in placebo patients. In women and the elderly (age 65 years and older) increases in diarrhea rates were evident starting at a dose of 150 mg daily, with rates for these subgroups at 150 mg similar to those seen at 300 mg for men or younger patients (all rates about 2%). Other GI symptoms included abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux, although increased rates for abdominal pain and dyspepsia were distinguished from placebo only at 600 mg daily. Diarrhea and other GI symptoms were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation. Aliskiren was associated with a slight increase in cough in the placebo-controlled studies (1.1% for any aliskiren use versus 0.6% for placebo). In active-controlled trials with ACE inhibitor (ramipril, lisinopril) arms, the rates of cough for the aliskiren arms were about one-third to one-half the rates in the ACE inhibitor arms. Other adverse reactions with increased rates for aliskiren compared to placebo included rash (1% versus 0.3%), elevated uric acid (0.4% versus 0.1%), gout (0.2% versus 0.1%), and renal stones (0.2% versus 0%). Single episodes of tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness were reported in 2 patients treated with aliskiren in the clinical trials. One patient had predisposing causes for seizures and had a negative electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral imaging following the seizures; for the other patient, EEG and imaging results were not reported. Aliskiren was discontinued and there was no rechallenge in either case. No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with aliskiren. Amlodipine besylate Amlodipine (NorvascÂ®) has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. Other adverse events that have been reported less than 1% but greater than 0.1% of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain were: Cardiovascular : arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, vasculitis Central and Peripheral Nervous System : hypoesthesia, neuropathy peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia General: allergic reaction, asthenia,** back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease Musculoskeletal System : arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps,** myalgia Psychiatric : sexual dysfunction (male** and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization Respiratory System: dyspnea,** epistaxis Skin and Appendages : angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus,** rash,** rash erythematous, rash maculopapular **These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies. Special Senses : abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus Urinary System : micturition frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia Autonomic Nervous System : dry mouth, sweating increased Metabolic and Nutritional : hyperglycemia, thirst Hemopoietic : leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia Other events reported with amlodipine at a frequency of less than or equal to 0.1% of patients include: cardiac failure, pulse irregularity, extrasystoles, skin discoloration, urticaria, skin dryness, alopecia, dermatitis, muscle weakness, twitching, ataxia, hypertonia, migraine, cold and clammy skin, apathy, agitation, amnesia, gastritis, increased appetite, loose stools, rhinitis, dysuria, polyuria, parosmia, taste perversion, abnormal visual accommodation, and xerophthalmia. Other reactions occurred sporadically and cannot be distinguished from medications or concurrent disease states such as myocardial infarction and angina. Clinical Laboratory Test Abnormalities RBC count, hemoglobin and hematocrit : Small mean changes from baseline were seen in RBC count, hemoglobin and hematocrit in patients treated with both Tekamlo and aliskiren monotherapy. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system. In aliskiren monotherapy trials these decreases led to slight increases in rates of anemia compared to placebo (0.1% for any aliskiren use, 0.3% for aliskiren 600 mg daily, versus 0% for placebo). No patients discontinued due to anemia. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)/Creatinine: In patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, elevations in BUN (greater than 40 mg/dL) and creatinine (greater than 2.0 mg/dL) in patients treated with Tekamlo were less than 1.0%. Serum Potassium: In patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, increases in serum potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L were infrequent (0.9% compared to 0.6% with placebo) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of either aliskiren or amlodipine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Aliskiren: Peripheral edema, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria, hepatic enzyme increase with clinical symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, pruritus, erythema, nausea,vomiting Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reactions and angioedema requiring airway management and hospitalization Amlodipine: The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Avoid concomitant use with ARBs or ACEIs particularly in patients with renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) <60 mL/min]. (5.2, 5.4) Anaphylactic Reactions and Angioedema. (5.3) Hypotension: Correct imbalances in volume- and/or salt-depleted patients. (5.4) Increased angina or myocardial infarction may occur upon dosage initiation or increase in amlodipine (5.5) Impaired Renal Function: Monitor serum creatinine periodically (5.6) Hyperkalemia: Monitor potassium levels periodically (5.8) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Tekamlo as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Renal Impairment/Hyperkalemia/Hypotension when Tekamlo is Given in Combination with ARBs or ACEIs Tekamlo is contraindicated in patients with diabetes who are receiving ARBs or ACEIs because of the increased risk of renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 60 mL/min [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. 5.3 Anaphylactic Reactions and Head and Neck Angioedema Aliskiren Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylactic reactions and angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx have been reported in patients treated with aliskiren and has necessitated hospitalization and intubation. This may occur at any time during treatment and has occurred in patients with and without a history of angioedema with ACEIs or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported from postmarketing experience with unknown frequency. If angioedema involves the throat, tongue, glottis or larynx, or if the patient has a history of upper respiratory surgery, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who experience these effects, even without respiratory distress, require prolonged observation and appropriate monitoring measures since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient to prevent respiratory involvement. Prompt administration of subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and measures to ensure a patent airway may be necessary. Discontinue Tekamlo immediately in patients who develop anaphylactic reactions or angioedema and do not readminister [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Hypotension Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Tekamlo in patients with marked volume depletion, patients with salt depletion, or with combined use of aliskiren and other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Tekamlo, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. Amlodipine besylate Symptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely. 5.5 Risk of Myocardial Infarction or Increased Angina Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. 5.6 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with Tekamlo. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that affect the RAAS. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the RAAS (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or patients receiving ARB, ACEI or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID, including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), therapy may be at particular risk for developing acute renal failure on Tekamlo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 5.7 Cyclosporine or Itraconazole Aliskiren When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine or itraconazole, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine or itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.8 Hyperkalemia Aliskiren Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving aliskiren. Drugs that affect the RAAS can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes, combination use with ARBs or ACEI [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.2)], NSAIDs, including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), or potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics."

Data described below reflect the evaluation of the safety of Tekturna in more than 6,460 patients, including over 1,740 treated for longer than 6 months, and more than 1,250 patients for longer than 1 year. In placebo controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to a clinical adverse event, including uncontrolled hypertension, occurred in 2.2% of patients treated with Tekturna versus 3.5% of patients given placebo.

In a long-term active-control study with Tekturna and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) arms, the incidence of edema involving the face, hand or whole body was 0.4% in both treatment arms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Gastrointestinal: Tekturna produces dose-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions. Diarrhea was reported by 2.3% of patients at 300 mg, compared to 1.2% in placebo patients. In women and the elderly (age 65 years and older) increases in diarrhea rates were evident starting at a dose of 150 mg daily, with rates for these subgroups at 150 mg comparable to those seen at 300 mg for men or younger patients (all rates about 2.0% to 2.3%). Other GI symptoms included abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux, although increased rates for abdominal pain and dyspepsia were distinguished from placebo only at 600 mg daily. Diarrhea and other GI symptoms were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation. Cough: Tekturna was associated with a slight increase in cough in the placebo-controlled studies (1.1% for any Tekturna use versus 0.6% for placebo). In active-controlled trials with ACE inhibitor (ramipril, lisinopril) arms, the rates of cough for the Tekturna arms were about one-third to one-half the rates in the ACE inhibitor arms. Seizures: Single episodes of tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness were reported in 2 patients treated with Tekturna in the clinical trials. One of these patients did have predisposing causes for seizures and had a negative electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral imaging following the seizures (for the other patient EEG and imaging results were not reported). Tekturna was discontinued and there was no rechallenge. Other adverse effects with increased rates for Tekturna compared to placebo included rash (1% versus 0.3%), elevated uric acid (0.4% versus 0.1%), gout (0.2% versus 0.1%) and renal stones (0.2% versus 0%). Aliskirenâ€™s effect on ECG intervals was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active-controlled (moxifloxacin), 7-day repeat dosing study with Holter-monitoring and 12 lead ECGs throughout the interdosing interval. No effect of aliskiren on QT interval was seen. Clinical Laboratory Findings In controlled clinical trials, clinically relevant changes in standard laboratory parameters were rarely associated with the administration of Tekturna in patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI. In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, Tekturna had no clinically important effects on total cholesterol, HDL, fasting triglycerides, or fasting glucose. Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine: In patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine were observed in less than 7% of patients treated with Tekturna alone versus 6% on placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.08 g/dL and 0.16 volume percent, respectively, for all aliskiren monotherapy) were observed. The decreases were dose-related and were 0.24 g/dL and 0.79 volume percent for 600 mg daily. This effect is also seen with other agents acting on the renin angiotensin system, such as angiotensin inhibitors and ARBs and may be mediated by reduction of angiotensin II which stimulates erythropoietin production via the AT1 receptor. These decreases led to slight increases in rates of anemia with aliskiren compared to placebo were observed (0.1% for any aliskiren use, 0.3% for aliskiren 600 mg daily, versus 0% for placebo). No patients discontinued therapy due to anemia. Serum Potassium: In patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, increases in serum potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L were infrequent (0.9% compared to 0.6% with placebo) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Serum Uric Acid: Aliskiren monotherapy produced small median increases in serum uric acid levels (about 6 micromol/L) while HCTZ produced larger increases (about 30 micromol/L). The combination of aliskiren with HCTZ appears to be additive (about 40 micromol/L increase). The increases in uric acid appear to lead to slight increases in uric acid-related AEs: elevated uric acid (0.4% versus 0.1%), gout (0.2% versus. 0.1%), and renal stones (0.2% versus 0%). Creatine Kinase: Increases in creatine kinase of greater than 300% were recorded in about 1% of aliskiren monotherapy patients versus 0.5% of placebo patients. Five cases of creatine kinase rises, 3 leading to discontinuation and 1 diagnosed as subclinical rhabdomyolysis, and another as myositis, were reported as adverse events with aliskiren use in the clinical trials. No cases were associated with renal dysfunction. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in aliskiren postmarketing experience. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reactions and angioedema requiring airway management and hospitalization Urticaria Peripheral edema Hepatic enzyme increase with clinical symptoms of hepatic dysfunction Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis Pruritus Erythema Nausea Vomiting"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Avoid concomitant use with ARBs or ACEIs particularly in patients with renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) <60 mL/min]. (5.2, 5.4) Anaphylactic Reactions and Angioedema. (5.3) Hypotension: Correct imbalances in volume and/or salt depleted patients. (5.4) Impaired Renal Function: Monitor serum creatinine periodically. (5.5) Hyperkalemia: Monitor potassium levels periodically. (5.6) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Tekturna as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.2 Renal Impairment/Hyperkalemia/Hypotension when Tekturna is Given in Combination with ARBs or ACEIs Tekturna is contraindicated in patients with diabetes who are receiving ARBs or ACEIs because of the increased risk of renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and hypotension. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 60 mL/min [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. 5.3 Anaphylactic Reactions and Head and Neck Angioedema Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylactic reactions and angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx have been reported in patients treated with Tekturna and has necessitated hospitalization and intubation. This may occur at any time during treatment and has occurred in patients with and without a history of angioedema with ACEIs or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported from postmarketing experience with unknown frequency. If angioedema involves the throat, tongue, glottis or larynx, or if the patient has a history of upper respiratory surgery, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who experience these effects, even without respiratory distress, require prolonged observation and appropriate monitoring measures since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient to prevent respiratory involvement. Prompt administration of subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and measures to ensure a patent airway may be necessary. Discontinue Tekturna immediately in patients who develop anaphylactic reactions or angioedema, and do not readminister [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Hypotension Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Tekturna in patients with marked volume depletion, patients with salt depletion, or with combined use of aliskiren and other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Tekturna, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. 5.5 Impaired Renal Function Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with Tekturna. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that affect the RAAS. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the RAAS (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or patients receiving ARB, ACEI or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), therapy may be at particular risk for developing acute renal failure on Tekturna [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function. 5.6 Hyperkalemia Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving Tekturna. Drugs that affect the RAAS can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes, combination use with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.3)], NSAIDs, or potassium supplements or potassium sparing diuretics. 5.7 Cyclosporine or Itraconazole When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine or itraconazole, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine or itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)]."
