        "Drug Interactions Severe hypertension has been reported when oxytocin was given three to four hours following prophylactic administration of a vasoconstrictor in conjunction with caudal block anesthesia. Cyclopropane anesthesia may modify oxytocin's cardiovascular effects, so as to produce unexpected results such as hypotension. Maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal atrioventricular rhythms has also been noted when oxytocin was used concomitantly with cyclopropane anesthesia."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been reported in the mother: Anaphylactic reaction Premature ventricular contractions Postpartum hemorrhage Pelvic hematoma Cardiac arrhythmia Subarachnoid hemorrhage Fatal afibrinogenemia Hypertensive episodes Nausea Rupture of the uterus Vomiting Excessive dosage or hypersensitivity to the drug may result in uterine hypertonicity, spasm, tetanic contraction, or rupture of the uterus. The possibility of increased blood loss and afibrinogenemia should be kept in mind when administering the drug. Severe water intoxication with convulsions and coma has occurred, associated with a slow oxytocin infusion over a 24-hour period. Maternal death due to oxytocin-induced water intoxication has been reported. The following adverse reactions have been reported in the fetus or neonate: Due to induced uterine motility: Due to use of oxytocin in the mother: Bradycardia Low Apgar scores at five minutes Premature ventricular contractions and other arrhythmias Neonatal jaundice Permanent CNS or brain damage Neonatal retinal hemorrhage Fetal death Neonatal seizures have been reported with the use of Pitocin.
