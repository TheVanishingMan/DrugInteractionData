        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 Inhibitors: May increase dasatinib drug levels and should be avoided. If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor closely and consider reducing SPRYCEL dose. (2.1, 7.1) CYP3A4 Inducers: May decrease dasatinib drug levels. If coadministration cannot be avoided, consider increasing SPRYCEL dose. (2.1, 7.2) Antacids: May decrease dasatinib drug levels. Avoid simultaneous administration. If needed, administer the antacid at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of SPRYCEL. (7.2) H2 Antagonists/Proton Pump Inhibitors: May decrease dasatinib drug levels. Consider antacids in place of H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors. (7.2) 7.1 Drugs That May Increase Dasatinib Plasma Concentrations CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Dasatinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. In a study of 18 patients with solid tumors, 20-mg SPRYCEL once daily coadministered with 200 mg of ketoconazole twice daily increased the dasatinib Cmax and AUC by four- and five-fold, respectively. Concomitant use of SPRYCEL and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with SPRYCEL, close monitoring for toxicity and a SPRYCEL dose reduction should be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 7.2 Drugs That May Decrease Dasatinib Plasma Concentrations CYP3A4 Inducers: When a single morning dose of SPRYCEL was administered following 8 days of continuous evening administration of 600 mg of rifampin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, the mean Cmax and AUC of dasatinib were decreased by 81% and 82%, respectively. Alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential should be considered. If SPRYCEL must be administered with a CYP3A4 inducer, a dose increase in SPRYCEL should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Antacids: Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is pH dependent. In a study of 24 healthy subjects, administration of 30 mL of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide 2 hours prior to a single 50-mg dose of SPRYCEL was associated with no relevant change in dasatinib AUC; however, the dasatinib Cmax increased 26%. When 30 mL of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide was administered to the same subjects concomitantly with a 50-mg dose of SPRYCEL, a 55% reduction in dasatinib AUC and a 58% reduction in Cmax were observed. Simultaneous administration of SPRYCEL with antacids should be avoided. If antacid therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of SPRYCEL. H2 Antagonists/Proton Pump Inhibitors: Long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors (eg, famotidine and omeprazole) is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure. In a study of 24 healthy subjects, administration of a single 50-mg dose of SPRYCEL 10 hours following famotidine reduced the AUC and Cmax of dasatinib by 61% and 63%, respectively. In a study of 14 healthy subjects, administration of a single 100-mg dose of SPRYCEL 22 hours following a 40-mg omeprazole dose at steady state reduced the AUC and Cmax of dasatinib by 43% and 42%, respectively. The concomitant use of H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors with SPRYCEL is not recommended. The use of antacids (at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of SPRYCEL) should be considered in place of H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving SPRYCEL therapy. 7.3 Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentration Altered By Dasatinib CYP3A4 Substrates: Single-dose data from a study of 54 healthy subjects indicate that the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate, were increased by 37% and 20%, respectively, when simvastatin was administered in combination with a single 100-mg dose of SPRYCEL. Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving SPRYCEL."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (≥10%) in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML included myelosuppression, fluid retention, diarrhea, headache, musculoskeletal pain, and rash. Most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy included myelosuppression, fluid retention events, diarrhea, headache, dyspnea, skin rash, fatigue, nausea, and hemorrhage. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Bleeding related events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Fluid retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and myocardial infarction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to SPRYCEL in clinical studies including 258 patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML and in 2182 patients with imatinib resistant or intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL. In the newly diagnosed chronic phase CML trial, the median duration of therapy was 18 months; the median average daily dose was 99 mg. In the imatinib resistant or intolerant CML or Ph+ ALL clinical trials, patients had a minimum of 2 years follow-up (starting dosage 100 mg once daily, 140 mg once daily, 50 mg twice daily, or 70 mg twice daily). Among patients with chronic phase CML and resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy, the median duration of treatment with SPRYCEL 100 mg once daily was 24 months (range 1–33 months). The median duration of treatment with SPRYCEL 140 mg once daily was 15 months (range 0.03–36 months) for accelerated phase CML, 3 months (range 0.03–29 months) for myeloid blast phase CML, and 3 months (range 0.1–10 months) for lymphoid blast CML. The majority of SPRYCEL-treated patients experienced adverse reactions at some time. In the newly diagnosed chronic phase CML trial, drug was discontinued for adverse reactions in 6% of SPRYCEL-treated patients. Among patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy, the rates of discontinuation for adverse reaction were 15% in chronic phase CML, 16% in accelerated phase CML, 15% in myeloid blast phase CML, 8% in lymphoid blast phase CML, and 8% in Ph+ ALL. In a dose-optimization study in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy and chronic phase CML, the rate of discontinuation for adverse reaction was lower in patients treated with 100 mg once daily than in patients treated with other dosing regimens (10% and 16%, respectively). The most frequently reported adverse reactions reported in ≥10% of patients in newly diagnosed chronic phase CML included myelosuppression, fluid retention events (pleural effusion, superficial localized edema, generalized edema), diarrhea, headache, musculoskeletal pain, and rash. Pleural effusions were reported in 31 patients (see Table 2). The most frequently reported adverse reactions reported in ≥20% of patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy included myelosuppression, fluid retention events, diarrhea, headache, dyspnea, skin rash, fatigue, nausea, and hemorrhage. The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML included pleural effusion (2%), hemorrhage (2%), congestive heart failure (1%), and pyrexia (1%). The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy included pleural effusion (11%), gastrointestinal bleeding (4%), febrile neutropenia (4%), dyspnea (3%), pneumonia (3%), pyrexia (3%), diarrhea (3%), infection (2%), congestive heart failure/cardiac dysfunction (2%), pericardial effusion (1%), and CNS hemorrhage (1%). 6.1 Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Adverse reactions (excluding laboratory abnormalities) that were reported in at least 10% of patients are shown in Table 2 for newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase CML and Table 3 for CML patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy.

The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia was higher in patients with advanced phase CML than in chronic phase CML (Tables 4 and 5). Myelosuppression was reported in patients with normal baseline laboratory values as well as in patients with pre-existing laboratory abnormalities. In patients who experienced severe myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following dose interruption or reduction; permanent discontinuation of treatment occurred in 2% of patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML and 5% of patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminase or bilirubin and Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia were reported in patients with all phases of CML but were reported with an increased frequency in patients with myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML. Elevations in transaminase or bilirubin were usually managed with dose reduction or interruption. Patients developing Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia during the course of SPRYCEL therapy often had recovery with oral calcium supplementation. Laboratory abnormalities reported in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML are shown in Table 4. There were no discontinuations of SPRYCEL therapy in this patient population due to biochemical laboratory parameters.

The median duration of treatment was 3 months (range 0.03–31 months). The safety profile of patients with Ph+ ALL was similar to those with lymphoid blast phase CML. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included fluid retention events, such as pleural effusion (24%) and superficial edema (19%), and gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea (31%), nausea (24%), and vomiting (16%). Hemorrhage (19%), pyrexia (17%), rash (16%), and dyspnea (16%) were also frequently reported. The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions included pleural effusion (11%), gastrointestinal bleeding (7%), febrile neutropenia (6%), infection (5%), pyrexia (4%), pneumonia (3%), diarrhea (3%), nausea (2%), vomiting (2%), and colitis (2%). 6.3 Additional Data From Clinical Trials The following adverse reactions were reported in patients in the SPRYCEL clinical studies at a frequency of 1%–<10%, 0.1%–<1%, or <0.1%.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelosuppression: Severe thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia may occur and require dose interruption or reduction. Monitor complete blood counts regularly. (2.3, 5.1, 6.1) Bleeding Related Events (mostly associated with severe thrombocytopenia): CNS and gastrointestinal hemorrhages, including fatalities, have occurred. Severe hemorrhage may require treatment interruptions and transfusions. Use SPRYCEL with caution in patients requiring medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants. (5.2, 6.1) Fluid Retention: SPRYCEL is associated with fluid retention, sometimes severe, including ascites, edema, and pleural and pericardial effusions. Manage with appropriate supportive care measures. (5.3, 6.1) QT Prolongation: Use SPRYCEL with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the QT interval. (5.4) Congestive Heart Failure, Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Myocardial Infarction: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction and treat appropriately. (5.5, 6.1) Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH): SPRYCEL may increase the risk of developing PAH which may be reversible on discontinuation. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating SPRYCEL and during treatment. (5.6) Use in Pregnancy: Fetal harm may occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (5.7, 8.1) 5.1 Myelosuppression Treatment with SPRYCEL is associated with severe (NCI CTC Grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Their occurrence is more frequent in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in chronic phase CML. In a dose-optimization study in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy and chronic phase CML, Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was reported less frequently in patients treated with 100 mg once daily than in patients treated with other dosing regimens. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by withholding SPRYCEL temporarily or dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Bleeding Related Events In addition to causing thrombocytopenia in human subjects, dasatinib caused platelet dysfunction in vitro. In all clinical studies, severe central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages, including fatalities, occurred in 1% of patients receiving SPRYCEL. Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including fatalities, occurred in 4% of patients and generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. Other cases of severe hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients. Most bleeding events were associated with severe thrombocytopenia. Patients were excluded from participation in initial SPRYCEL clinical studies if they took medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants. In subsequent trials, the use of anticoagulants, aspirin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was allowed concurrently with SPRYCEL if the platelet count was >50,000–75,000 per microliter. Exercise caution if patients are required to take medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants. 5.3 Fluid Retention SPRYCEL is associated with fluid retention. In clinical trials, severe fluid retention was reported in up to 10% of patients. Ascites and generalized edema were each reported in <1% of patients. Severe pulmonary edema was reported in 1% of patients. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of pleural effusion, such as dyspnea or dry cough, should be evaluated by chest X-ray. Severe pleural effusion may require thoracentesis and oxygen therapy. Fluid retention events were typically managed by supportive care measures that include diuretics or short courses of steroids. In dose-optimization studies, fluid retention events were reported less frequently with once daily dosing than with other dosing regimens. 5.4 QT Prolongation In vitro data suggest that dasatinib has the potential to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarization (QT interval). Of the 2440 patients with CML treated with SPRYCEL in clinical studies, 15 patients (<1%) had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. Twenty-two patients (1%) experienced a QTcF >500 ms. In 865 patients with leukemia treated with SPRYCEL in five Phase 2 single-arm studies, the maximum mean changes in QTcF (90% upper bound CI) from baseline ranged from 7.0 ms to 13.4 ms. Administer SPRYCEL with caution to patients who have or may develop prolongation of QTc. These include patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, patients with congenital long QT syndrome, patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicines or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation, and cumulative high-dose anthracycline therapy. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to SPRYCEL administration. 5.5 Congestive Heart Failure, Left Ventricular Dysfunction, and Myocardial Infarction Cardiac adverse reactions were reported in 5.8% of 258 patients taking SPRYCEL, including 1.6% of patients with cardiomyopathy, heart failure congestive, diastolic dysfunction, fatal myocardial infarction, and left ventricular dysfunction. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction and treat appropriately. 5.6 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension SPRYCEL may increase the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) which may occur anytime after initiation, including after more than one year of treatment. Manifestations include dyspnea, fatigue, hypoxia, and fluid retention. PAH may be reversible on discontinuation of SPRYCEL. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating SPRYCEL and during treatment. If PAH is confirmed, SPRYCEL should be permanently discontinued. 5.7 Use in Pregnancy SPRYCEL may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In nonclinical studies, at plasma concentrations below those observed in humans receiving therapeutic doses of dasatinib, embryo-fetal toxicities, including skeletal malformations, were observed in rats and rabbits. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of SPRYCEL in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with SPRYCEL [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]."

In a trial of 18 patients with solid tumors, 20-mg SPRYCEL once daily coadministered with 200 mg of ketoconazole twice daily increased the dasatinib Cmax and AUC by four- and five-fold, respectively. Concomitant use of SPRYCEL and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with SPRYCEL, close monitoring for toxicity and a SPRYCEL dose reduction should be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 7.2 Drugs That May Decrease Dasatinib Plasma Concentrations CYP3A4 Inducers: When a single morning dose of SPRYCEL was administered following 8 days of continuous evening administration of 600 mg of rifampin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, the mean Cmax and AUC of dasatinib were decreased by 81% and 82%, respectively. Alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential should be considered. If SPRYCEL must be administered with a CYP3A4 inducer, a dose increase in SPRYCEL should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Antacids: Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is pH dependent. In a trial of 24 healthy subjects, administration of 30 mL of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide 2 hours prior to a single 50-mg dose of SPRYCEL was associated with no relevant change in dasatinib AUC; however, the dasatinib Cmax increased 26%. When 30 mL of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide was administered to the same subjects concomitantly with a 50-mg dose of SPRYCEL, a 55% reduction in dasatinib AUC and a 58% reduction in Cmax were observed. Simultaneous administration of SPRYCEL with antacids should be avoided. If antacid therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of SPRYCEL. H2 Antagonists/Proton Pump Inhibitors: Long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors (e.g., famotidine and omeprazole) is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure. In a trial of 24 healthy subjects, administration of a single 50-mg dose of SPRYCEL 10 hours following famotidine reduced the AUC and Cmax of dasatinib by 61% and 63%, respectively. In a trial of 14 healthy subjects, administration of a single 100-mg dose of SPRYCEL 22 hours following a 40-mg omeprazole dose at steady state reduced the AUC and Cmax of dasatinib by 43% and 42%, respectively. The concomitant use of H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors with SPRYCEL is not recommended. The use of antacids (at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of SPRYCEL) should be considered in place of H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving SPRYCEL therapy. 7.3 Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentration Altered By Dasatinib CYP3A4 Substrates: Single-dose data from a trial of 54 healthy subjects indicate that the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate, were increased by 37% and 20%, respectively, when simvastatin was administered in combination with a single 100-mg dose of SPRYCEL. Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving SPRYCEL.",

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: •Myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. •Bleeding-related events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. •Fluid retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. •Cardiovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. •Pulmonary arterial hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. •QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. •Severe dermatologic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. •Tumor lysis syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. •Embryo-fetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to SPRYCEL at all doses tested in clinical studies including 324 patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML and in 2388 patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic or advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL. The median duration of therapy in 2712 SPRYCEL-treated patients was 19.2 months (range 0–93.2 months). In a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, the median duration of therapy was approximately 60 months. The median duration of therapy in 1618 patients with chronic phase CML was 29 months (range 0–92.9 months). The median duration of therapy in 1094 patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL was 6.2 months (range 0–93.2 months). In the overall population of 2712 SPRYCEL-treated patients, 88% of patients experienced adverse reactions at some time and 19% experienced adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation. In the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML, drug was discontinued for adverse reactions in 16% of SPRYCEL-treated patients with a minimum of 60 months of follow-up. After a minimum of 60 months of follow-up, the cumulative discontinuation rate was 39%. Among the 1618 SPRYCEL-treated patients with chronic phase CML, drug-related adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in 329 (20.3%) patients; among the 1094 SPRYCEL-treated patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, drug-related adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in 191 (17.5%) patients. Adverse reactions reported in ≥10% of patients, and other adverse reactions of interest, in a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML at a median follow-up of approximately 60 months are presented in Table 2. Adverse reactions reported in ≥10% of patients treated at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily (n=165), and other adverse reactions of interest, in a randomized dose-optimization trial of patients with chronic phase CML resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib therapy at a median follow-up of approximately 84 months are presented in Table 4. Drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for 16.7% of SPRYCEL-treated patients in the randomized trial of patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML. Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients included pleural effusion (5%). Drug-related SAEs were reported for 26.1% of patients treated at the recommended dose of 100 mg once daily in the randomized dose-optimization trial of patients with chronic phase CML resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib therapy. Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients included pleural effusion (10%). Most common adverse reactions (≥15%) in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML included myelosuppression, fluid retention, and diarrhea. Most common adverse reactions (≥15%) in patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy included myelosuppression, fluid retention events, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, skin rash, nausea, hemorrhage, and musculoskeletal pain.

The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia was higher in patients with advanced phase CML than in chronic phase CML (Tables 7 and 8). Myelosuppression was reported in patients with normal baseline laboratory values as well as in patients with pre-existing laboratory abnormalities. In patients who experienced severe myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following dose interruption or reduction; permanent discontinuation of treatment occurred in 2% of patients in a randomized trial of patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML and 5% of patients with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Grade 3 or 4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin and Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia were reported in patients with all phases of CML but were reported with an increased frequency in patients with myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML. Elevations in transaminases or bilirubin were usually managed with dose reduction or interruption. Patients developing Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia during the course of SPRYCEL therapy often had recovery with oral calcium supplementation. Laboratory abnormalities reported in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML are shown in Table 7. There were no discontinuations of SPRYCEL therapy in this patient population due to biochemical laboratory parameters.

The median duration of treatment was 3 months (range 0.03–31 months). The safety profile of patients with Ph+ ALL was similar to those with lymphoid blast phase CML. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included fluid retention events, such as pleural effusion (24%) and superficial edema (19%), and gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea (31%), nausea (24%), and vomiting (16%). Hemorrhage (19%), pyrexia (17%), rash (16%), and dyspnea (16%) were also frequently reported. Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients included pleural effusion (11%), gastrointestinal bleeding (7%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and infection (5%). 6.3 Additional Pooled Data From Clinical Trials The following additional adverse reactions were reported in patients in SPRYCEL CML and Ph+ ALL clinical studies at a frequency of ≥10%, 1%–<10%, 0.1%–<1%, or <0.1%.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myelosuppression and Bleeding Events: Severe thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia may occur. Use caution if used concomitantly with medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants. Monitor complete blood counts regularly. Transfuse and interrupt SPRYCEL when indicated. (2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1) • Fluid Retention: Fluid retention, sometimes severe, including pleural effusions. Manage with supportive care measures and/or dose modification. (2.3, 5.3, 6.1) • Cardiac Dysfunction: Monitor patients for signs or symptoms and treat appropriately. (5.4, 6.1) • Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH): SPRYCEL may increase the risk of developing PAH which may be reversible on discontinuation. Consider baseline risk and evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of PAH during treatment. Stop SPRYCEL if PAH is confirmed. (5.5) • QT Prolongation: Use SPRYCEL with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the QT interval. (5.6) • Severe Dermatologic Reactions: Individual cases of severe mucocutaneous dermatologic reactions have been reported. (5.7, 6.4) • Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported. Maintain adequate hydration and correct uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with SPRYCEL. (5.8) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to fetus and avoid pregnancy. (5.9, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Myelosuppression Treatment with SPRYCEL is associated with severe (NCI CTC Grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia, which occur earlier and more frequently in patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in patients with chronic phase CML. In patients with chronic phase CML, perform complete blood counts (CBCs) every 2 weeks for 12 weeks, then every 3 months thereafter, or as clinically indicated. In patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, perform CBCs weekly for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression is generally reversible and usually managed by withholding SPRYCEL temporarily and/or dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.2 Bleeding-Related Events In addition to causing thrombocytopenia in human subjects, dasatinib caused platelet dysfunction in vitro. In all CML or Ph+ ALL clinical studies, ≥grade 3 central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages, including fatalities, occurred in <1% of patients receiving SPRYCEL. Grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including fatalities, occurred in 4% of patients and generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. Other cases of ≥grade 3 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients. Most bleeding events in clinical studies were associated with severe thrombocytopenia. Concomitant medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants may increase the risk of hemorrhage. 5.3 Fluid Retention SPRYCEL may cause fluid retention. After 5 years of follow-up in the randomized newly diagnosed chronic phase CML study (n=258), grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 5% of patients, including 3% of patients with grade 3 or 4 pleural effusion. In patients with newly diagnosed or imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic phase CML, grade 3 or 4 fluid retention occurred in 6% of patients treated with SPRYCEL at the recommended dose (n=548). In patients with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL treated with SPRYCEL at the recommended dose (n=304), grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 8% of patients, including grade 3 or 4 pleural effusion reported in 7% of patients. Evaluate patients who develop symptoms of pleural effusion or other fluid retention, such as new or worsened dyspnea on exertion or at rest, pleuritic chest pain, or dry cough, promptly with a chest x-ray or additional diagnostic imaging as appropriate. Fluid retention events were typically managed by supportive care measures that may include diuretics or short courses of steroids. Severe pleural effusion may require thoracentesis and oxygen therapy. Consider dose reduction or treatment interruption [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.4 Cardiovascular Events After 5 years of follow-up in the randomized newly diagnosed chronic phase CML trial (n=258), the following cardiac adverse events occurred: cardiac ischemic events (3.9% dasatinib vs 1.6% imatinib), cardiac-related fluid retention (8.5% dasatinib vs 3.9% imatinib), and conduction system abnormalities, most commonly arrhythmia and palpitations (7.0% dasatinib vs 5.0% imatinib). Two cases (0.8%) of peripheral arterial occlusive disease occurred with imatinib and 2 (0.8%) transient ischemic attacks occurred with dasatinib. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac dysfunction and treat appropriately. 5.5 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension SPRYCEL may increase the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) which may occur any time after initiation, including after more than 1 year of treatment. Manifestations include dyspnea, fatigue, hypoxia, and fluid retention. PAH may be reversible on discontinuation of SPRYCEL. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating SPRYCEL and during treatment. If PAH is confirmed, SPRYCEL should be permanently discontinued. 5.6 QT Prolongation In vitro data suggest that dasatinib has the potential to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarization (QT interval). Of 2440 patients treated with SPRYCEL at all doses tested in clinical studies, 16 patients (<1%) had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse reaction. Twenty-two patients (1%) experienced a QTcF >500 ms. In 865 patients with leukemia treated with SPRYCEL in five Phase 2 single-arm studies, the maximum mean changes in QTcF (90% upper bound CI) from baseline ranged from 7.0 to 13.4 ms. SPRYCEL may increase the risk of prolongation of QTc in patients including those with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, patients with congenital long QT syndrome, patients taking antiarrhythmic medicines or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation, and cumulative high-dose anthracycline therapy. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to and during SPRYCEL administration. 5.7 Severe Dermatologic Reactions Cases of severe mucocutaneous dermatologic reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme, have been reported in patients treated with SPRYCEL. Discontinue permanently in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction during treatment if no other etiology can be identified. 5.8 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in patients with resistance to prior imatinib therapy, primarily in advanced phase disease. Due to potential for tumor lysis syndrome, maintain adequate hydration, correct uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with SPRYCEL, and monitor electrolyte levels. Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden may be at increased risk and should be monitored more frequently [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. 5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on limited human data, SPRYCEL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Adverse pharmacologic effects of SPRYCEL including hydrops fetalis, fetal leukopenia, and fetal thrombocytopenia have been reported with maternal exposure to SPRYCEL. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy, which may include the use of effective contraception, during treatment with SPRYCEL and for 30 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].",
