The most common adverse reactions observed in ≥ 2% of patients in the clinical studies for Anascorp were: vomiting, pyrexia, rash, nausea and pruritus. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. A total of 1534 patients were treated with Anascorp, ranging from less than one month to 90 years old. The patient population was comprised of 802 males and 732 females. Patients were monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions, including acute hypersensitivity reactions and serum sickness. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted at 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after treatment to assess symptoms suggestive of ongoing venom effect, serum sickness, and any other adverse reactions. Table 1 shows the adverse reactions occurring in patients across all clinical trials for Anascorp. Twenty-seven percent (421/1534) of patients receiving Anascorp reported at least one adverse reaction.

Eight patients were considered to have serum sickness (Type III hypersensitivity); no patient manifested the full serum sickness syndrome. Three patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids and five others received either no treatment or symptomatic therapy. 34 patients experienced a total of 39 severe adverse reactions such as respiratory distress, aspiration, hypoxia, ataxia, pneumonia, and eye swelling. It is not clear whether these adverse reactions were related to Anascorp envenomation or a combination of both. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Anascorp.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible with Anascorp. Prepare for monitoring and management of allergic reactions, particularly in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to equine (horse) proteins or patients who have received previous therapy with antivenoms containing scorpion or equine proteins.(5.1) Delayed allergic reactions (serum sickness) may occur following treatment with Anascorp. Patient monitoring with follow-up visit is recommended.(5.2) Anascorp is made from equine plasma and may contain infectious agents, e.g. viruses.(5.3) Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of cresol as an injectable excipient.(5.4) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur with Anascorp. Close patient monitoring for hypersensitivity reactions and readiness with intravenous therapy using epinephrine, corticosteroids, and diphenhydramine hydrochloride is recommended during the infusion of Anascorp. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs during the infusion, terminate administration at once and administer appropriate emergency medical care. Patients with known allergies to horse protein are particularly at risk for an anaphylactic reaction. Patients who have had previous therapy with Anascorp or another equine antivenom/antitoxin may have become sensitized to equine protein and be at risk for a severe hypersensitivity reaction. 5.2 Delayed Allergic Reactions (Serum Sickness) Monitor patients with follow-up visit(s) for signs and symptoms of delayed allergic reactions or serum sickness (e.g., rash, fever, myalgia, arthralgia), and treat appropriately if necessary. Eight out of 1,534 (0.5%) patients in the clinical trials exhibited symptoms suggestive of serum sickness. (6.1) 5.3 Transmissible Infectious Agents Anascorp is made from equine (horse) plasma, it may therefore carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses. 5.4 Reaction to Cresol Trace amounts of cresol from the manufacturing process are contained in Anascorp. Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of cresol as an injectable excipient."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions with an incidence of > 5% during a clinical trial were headache and nausea. (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Octapharma at 1-866-766-4860 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Adverse Drug Reaction Overview The most serious adverse reactions observed with Octagam 5% Liquid treatment have been immediate anaphylactic reactions, aseptic meningitis, and hemolytic anemia. The most common adverse reactions observed with Octagam 5% Liquid treatment during clinical trial (> 5%) were headache and nausea. Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another product and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The clinical trial database includes a multi-center, open-label, single arm study in 46 children and adults with PI. Subjects participated in the study for a mean of 346 days and received 300 to 450 mg/kg every 21 days or 400 to 600 mg/kg every 28 days. Infusions were initiated at a rate of 30 mg/kg/hour for the first 30 minutes, and, if tolerated, could be advanced to a maximum tolerated rate not exceeding 200 mg/kg/hour. Over half of the subjects were male (n=28; 61%), and more than half were on the 28-day infusion schedule (n=27; 59%). The mean age of subjects was 31.5 years. Six subjects experienced a total of 12 SAEs (abdominal pain (2 occurrences), cardiac arrest, pneumonia, cellulitis, coxsackie viral infection, renal calculus (2 occurrences), blood culture positive, ketonuria, gastroenteritis, and colitis pseudomembranosus). Eleven of the 12 SAEs were not suspected to be related to study drug; the other SAE was noted before the subject began receiving the next scheduled infusion, and it was not temporally related to the previous infusion. Pre-medications were used in 165 (25.2%) out of 654 infusions and in 14 (30.4%) out of 46 patients. Infusions were slowed or interrupted in 9 out of 489 infusions (1.84%) without pre-medication and in 10 out of 165 infusions (6.06%) with pre-medication. Five out of 32 (15.63%) patients who never received any pre-medication had at least one slowed or interrupted infusion, whereas 9 out of 14 (64.29%) patients who received pre-medication at least once also had a slowed or interrupted infusion. Six of the 46 subjects in the trial (13%) were withdrawn from the study: 2 on the subjects' request; 1 because of investigator's decision (non-compliance); 1 because of loss to follow-up; 1 death (cardiac arrest, not suspected to be related to study drug); and 1 by error of the study coordinator. All adverse events in trial OCTA-06, irrespective of the causality assessment, reported by at least 5% of subjects during the 12-months treatment are given in the table below.

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA are at greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions Epinephrine should be available immediately to treat any acute severe hypersensitivity reactions. (5.1) Monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, and urine output in patients at risk of developing acute renal failure. (5.2) Falsely elevated blood glucose readings may occur during and after the infusion of Octagam 5% liquid with some glucometer and test strip systems (5.3) Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia occur in patients receiving IGIV therapy. (5.4) Thrombotic events have occurred in patients receiving IGIV therapy. Monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events; consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity for those at risk of hyperviscosity. (5.5) Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome has been reported with Octagam 5% liquid and other IGIV treatments, especially with high doses or rapid infusion. (5.6) Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration (5.7) IGIV recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions (TRALI) (5.8) The product is made from human plasma and may contain infectious agents, e.g. viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent (5.9) Sensitivity Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur [ 1 ] (See Contraindications [4.1]). In case of hypersensitivity, Octagam 5% liquid infusion should be immediately discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted. Epinephrine should be immediately available for treatment of acute severe hypersensitivity reaction. IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA are at greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactoid reactions when administered Octagam 5% liquid (See Contraindications [4.2]). Patients known to have corn allergies should avoid using Octagam 5% liquid (See Contraindications [4.3]). Renal Failure Assure that patients are not volume depleted prior to the initiation of the infusion of Octagam 5% liquid. Periodic monitoring of renal function tests and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to have a potential increased risk of developing acute renal failure. Renal function, including a measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/serum creatinine, should be assessed prior to the initial infusion of Octagam 5% liquid and again at appropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function deteriorates, discontinuation of the product should be considered (See Patient Counselling Information [17]) For patients judged to be at risk for developing renal dysfunction and/or at risk of developing thrombotic events, it may be prudent to reduce the amount of product infused per unit time by infusing Octagam 5% liquid at a maximum rate less than 0.07 ml/kg (3.3 mg/kg)/minute (200 mg/kg/hour) (See Boxed Warning, and Dosage and Administration [2.4]). Blood Glucose Monitoring Blood Glucose Testing [ 2 ] :some types of blood glucose testing systems (for example, those based on the glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ) or glucose-dye-oxidoreductase methods) falsely interpret the maltose contained in Octagam 5% liquid as glucose. This has resulted in falsely elevated glucose readings and, consequently, in the inappropriate administration of insulin, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia. Also, cases of true hypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglycemic state is masked by falsely elevated glucose readings. Accordingly, when administering Octagam 5% liquid, the measurement of blood glucose must be done with a glucose-specific method. The product information of the blood glucose testing system, including that of the test strips, should be carefully reviewed to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products. If any uncertainty exists, contact the manufacturer of the testing system to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products. Hyperproteinemia Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving IGIV therapy. The hyponatremia is likely to be a pseudohyponatremia as demonstrated by a decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar gap. Distinguishing true hyponatremia from pseudohyponatremia is clinically critical, as treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity and a disposition to thromboembolic events [ 3 ]. Thrombotic events Thrombotic events have been reported in association with IGIV therapy [ 4 ],[ 5 ],[ 6 ]. Patients at risk may include those with a history of atherosclerosis, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, impaired cardiac output, coagulation disorders, prolonged periods of immobilization and/or known or suspected hyperviscosity. The potential risks and benefits of IGIV should be weighed against those of alternative therapies for all patients for whom IGIV administration is being considered. Baseline assessment of blood viscosity should be considered in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia / markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies. Aseptic meningitis syndrome Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported to occur infrequently in association with IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae. The syndrome usually begins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment and rapid infusion. It is characterized by symptoms and signs including severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea and vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cu mm, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dl. Patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs should receive a thorough neurological examination, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. It appears that patients with a history of migraine may be more susceptible. [ 7 ] (See Patient Counselling Information [17]). Hemolysis IGIV products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and, rarely, hemolysis [ 8 ]. Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration [See ADVERSE REACTIONS] [ 9 ]. IGIV recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis. If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after IGIV infusion, appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing should be done (See Patient Counseling Information [17]). Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) There have been reports of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)] in patients administered IGIV [ 10 ]. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever and typically occurs within 1-6 hours after transfusion. Patients with TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support. IGIV recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions (See Patient Counseling Information [17]). If TRALI is suspected, appropriate tests should be performed for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum. General Because this product is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. All infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Octapharma. The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient, before prescribing or administering it to the patient (See Patient Counseling Information [17]). Laboratory Tests If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after IGIV infusion, appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing should be done. If TRALI is susppected, appropriate tests should be performed for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum. Because of the potentially increased risk of thrombosis, baseline assessment of blood viscosity should be considered in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies."

Antibodies present in immune globulin preparations may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines such as polio, measles, mumps, and rubella; THEREFORE, VACCINATION WITH LIVE VIRUS VACCINES SHOULD BE DEFERRED UNTIL APPROXIMATELY THREE OR MORE MONTHS AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF BabyBIG. If such vaccinations were given shortly before or after BabyBIG administration, revaccination may be necessary. The passive transfer of antibodies may interfere with the response to live viral vaccines (7)."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious adverse reactions were not observed in clinical trials using BabyBIG. The most common adverse reaction observed with BabyBIG treatment during clinical trials (>5%) was skin rash. Other reactions such as chills, muscle cramps, back pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and wheezing were the most frequent adverse reactions observed during the clinical trials of similarly-prepared human IGIV products[21]. The incidence of these reactions was less than 5% of all infusions in BabyBIG clinical trials, and these reactions were most often related to infusion rates.[7] The most common adverse reaction occurring in at least 5% of the patients treated with BabyBIG in a controlled clinical study was mild and transient erythematous rash of the face or trunk (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact the California Department of Public Health at 1-510-231-7600 and http://www.infantbotulism.org/ or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Two clinical studies of BabyBIG were performed: (1) an adequate and well-controlled study to evaluate safety and efficacy of BabyBIG, which used BabyBIG Lot 1, and (2) an open label study to collect additional safety data and confirm efficacy, which used BabyBIG Lot 2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ].[14,15] Different methodologies were used to collect adverse events in the controlled study and open label study. Minor clinical events that were not recorded as adverse events in the controlled study were recorded as adverse events in the open label study. The only adverse event considered possibly related to BabyBIG administration was a mild, transient erythematous rash of the face or trunk. The following table summarizes the occurrence of rash by day of study relative to day of treatment for the randomized, controlled clinical trial (RCT) and for the open label study (OLS).

Eight percent of placebo-treated patients also experienced erythematous rash in this study. A similar rash is known to occur both in infant botulism patients who have not received any IGIV products[16] and in patients treated with other IGIVs,[2,3] making it difficult to ascertain the causality of the rash. In the controlled study only, the following adverse events occurred in at least 5% of the patients receiving BabyBIG or placebo: Adverse Event BabyBIG N=65 PlaceboBoth Gammagard 5% and Gammagard S/D 5% were used as placebo in this study.

For example, \"increased blood pressure\" or \"decreased blood pressure\" was assigned when transient changes in blood pressure were observed, whereas \"hypertension\" or \"hypotension\" was assigned when more prolonged or significant changes were observed. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causal relationship to product exposure. Experience with BabyBIG. No adverse reactions have been identified or reported that are ascribed to the use of BabyBIG during postapproval use. Retrospective publications have shown safety-related information consistent with the safety-related information in the approved product labeling, and no new safety-related information has been presented for BabyBIG.[22. 23] Experience with Other IGIV Products. Some classes of adverse reactions that have not been reported in BabyBIG clinical studies or postmarketing experience have been observed with the overall post-approval use of other IGIV products, as shown in the following table. Respiratory Apnea, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI), cyanosis, hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, dyspnea, bronchospasm Cardiovascular Cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, vascular collapse, hypotension Neurological Coma, loss of consciousness, seizures, tremor Integumentary Steven-Johnson syndrome, epidermolysis, erythema multiforme, bullous dermatitis Hematologic Pancytopenia, leukopenia, hemolysis, positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs') test General / Body as a Whole Pyrexia, rigors Musculoskeletal Back pain Gastrointestinal Hepatic dysfunction, abdominal pain"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Only administer BabyBIG as an intravenous infusion, since other routes of administration have not been evaluated. Do not use BabyBIG if the reconstituted solution is turbid [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1) ]. Assess renal function prior to and following administration (5.1, 5.2). Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions may occur (5.4). This risk should be considered when an IgA-deficient patient is to receive subsequent administration of blood products containing IgA after previous treatment with BabyBIG (4). Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving immune globulin intravenous (human) (IGIV) therapy (5.6). Thrombotic events have occurred in patients receiving IGIV products. Monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events; consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity for those at risk of hyperviscosity (5.7). Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration (5.8). IGIV recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions, such as Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) (5.9). Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported with other IGIV treatment, especially with high doses or rapid infusion (5.5). The product is made from human plasma and may contain infectious agents, e.g. viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent (5.3). 5.1 Patient Monitoring for Administration Patients should be well hydrated prior to the initiation of the BabyBIG infusion. Assess renal function, including the measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine prior to the initial infusion of BabyBIG [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2) ]. Periodic monitoring of renal function tests and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to have a potential risk for developing acute renal failure.[1-4] Increases in serum creatinine and BUN have been observed as soon as one to two days following treatment with other IGIV products. During administration, monitor the patient's vital signs continuously and observe the patient carefully for any associated symptoms. DO NOT EXCEED THE RECOMMENDED INFUSION RATE of 1 mL/kg/hour (50 mg/kg/h), and follow the infusion schedule closely [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ]. If a patient develops an infusion reaction, slow the rate of infusion immediately or temporarily interrupt the infusion. 5.2 Renal Adverse Reactions Other IGIV products have been reported to be associated with renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death.[5-6] While these reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many licensed IGIV products, those that contained sucrose as a stabilizer and were administered at daily doses of 400 mg/kg or greater have accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number.[7] BabyBIG contains sucrose as a stabilizer. Patients predisposed to acute renal failure include those patients with any degree of pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or who are receiving known nephrotoxic drugs. Especially in such patients, BabyBIG should be administered at the minimum concentration available and at the minimum rate of infusion practicable.[1] 5.3 Transmission of Blood-Borne Infectious Agents BabyBIG is made from human plasma and, like other plasma products, carries the possibility for transmission of blood-borne viral agents and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent. The risk of transmission of recognized blood-borne viruses has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, for the presence of certain viral infections, and by the viral inactivation and/or removal properties of the precipitation procedures used for the purification of BabyBIG [see DESCRIPTION (11) ]. Despite these measures, some as yet unrecognized blood-borne infectious agents may not be inactivated by the manufacturing process; therefore, BabyBIG, like any other blood product, should be given only if a benefit is expected [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17) ]. 5.4 Anaphylaxis Severe reactions, such as angioedema and anaphylactic shock, although not observed during clinical trials with BabyBIG, are a possibility.[8,9] Clinical anaphylaxis may occur even when the patient is not known to be sensitive to immune globulin products. A reaction may be related to the rate of infusion; therefore, carefully adhere to the infusion rates as outlined under \"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3).\" If anaphylaxis or a drop in blood pressure occurs, discontinue the infusion and administer epinephrine.[1-4] Although acute systemic allergic reactions were not seen in clinical trials with BabyBIG, epinephrine should be available for treatment of acute allergic symptoms [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ]. If hypotension or anaphylaxis occurs, discontinue the administration of BabyBIG immediately and give supportive care as needed. 5.5 Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome An aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported to occur infrequently in association with IGIV administration.[10-13] The syndrome usually begins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment. It is characterized by symptoms and signs that include the following: severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, and nausea and vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cubic millimeter, predominately from the granulocytic series, and with elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL. Conduct a thorough neurological examination in patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs to rule out other causes of meningitis.[10-13] AMS may occur more frequently in association with high total doses (2 g/kg) of IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae.[1] AMS was not observed in clinical trials of BabyBIG. 5.6 Hyperproteinemia, Hyponatremia, and Serum Viscosity Hyperproteinemia, hyponatremia, and increased serum viscosity have been observed following administration of IGIV products. It is clinically critical to distinguish true hyponatremia from pseudohyponatremia caused by decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar gap, because treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity and a higher risk of thromboembolic events. These adverse events have not been observed with BabyBIG. 5.7 Thrombotic Events Thrombotic events may occur following IGIV treatment. Patients at risk may include those with a history of atherosclerosis, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, impaired cardiac output, coagulation disorders, prolonged periods of immobilization, and/or known or suspected hyperviscosity. Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies. For patients judged to be at risk of developing thrombotic events, administer BabyBIG at the minimum rate of infusion practicable. 5.8 Hemolytic Anemia IGIV products may contain blood group antibodies, which can act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and, rarely, hemolysis. Hemolytic anemia may develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced red blood cell sequestration. Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis. If these are present after BabyBIG infusion, perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing. 5.9 Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients following IGIV treatment.[31] TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically occur within 1 to 6 hours following treatment [See PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17)]. Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum. TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support."

Treatment of ITP The safety of WinRho SDF was evaluated in clinical trials (n=161) in children and adults with acute and chronic ITP and adults and children with ITP secondary to HIV. Overall, 417 adverse events were reported by 91 patients (57%). The most common adverse events were headache (14% of the patients), fever (11% of the patients) and asthenia (11% of the patients). A total of 117 adverse drug reactions were re ported by 46 patients (29%). Headache, chills, and fever were the most common related adverse events (Table 4). With respect to safety profile per administration, 60/848 (7%) of WinRho® infusions had at least one adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions were headache (19 infusions; 2%), chills (14 infusions; < 2%), and fever (nine infusions; 1%).

Only 5/137 (3.7%) of patients had a maximum decrease in hemoglobin of greater than 4 g/dL (range: -4.2 to -6.1 g/dL). Suppression of Rh Isoimmunization In the clinical trial of 1,186 Rho(D)-negative pregnant women, no adverse reactions were reported to Rho(D) IGIV. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience Because post-marketing adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of WinRho ® SDF. Treatment of ITP These adverse reactions are classified by system organ class.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Both Indications (5.1) IgA deficient patients with known antibodies to IgA are at greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. (5.1.1) Risk of transmission of infectious agents: e.g., viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent, from human plasma. (5.1.2) Interference with non-glucose-specific blood monitoring systems may result in elevated glucose readings that lead to untreated hypoglycemia or inappropriate insulin administration.(5.1.3) Monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and urine output in patients at risk of developing acute renal failure. (5.1.4) Monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events; consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity for those at risk of hyperviscosity. (5.1.5) Passive transfer of antibodies may confound serologic testing. (5.1.6) Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions (transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]). (5.1.7) ITP (5.2) Risk of intravascular hemolysis (IVH) and its complications following administration of WinRho® SDF. (5.2.1) Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to WinRho® SDF therapy. Monitor patients for hemolysis and haemolytic anemi. (5.2.2) Suppression of Rh Isoimmunization (5.3) Do not administer to the newborn infant. 5.1 Both Indications 5.1.1 Hypersensitivity Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur [see Contraindications (4)] If symptoms of allergic or early signs of hypersensitivity reactions (including generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis) occur, discontinue WinRho® SDF infusion immediately and institute appropriate treatment. Have medications such as epinephrine available for immediate treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions. WinRho® SDF contains approximately 5 micrograms/mL IgA [see Description (11)]. Patients with known antibodies to IgA have a greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. WinRho® SDF is contraindicated in patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity reaction [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.1.2 Transmissible Infectious Agents Because WinRho® SDF is made from human plasma; it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. The risk of transmitting an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain pathogens, testing for the presence of certain current viral infections, and including virus inactivation/removal steps in the manufacturing process [see Description (11)] Report all infections thought to have been transmitted by WinRho® SDF to Cangene Corporation at 1-800-768-2304. The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient. 5.1.3 Interference with Blood Glucose Testing: False High Blood Glucose Levels The liquid formulation of WinRho® SDF contains maltose. Maltose in IGIV products has been shown to give falsely high blood glucose levels in certain types of blood glucose testing systems [for example, by systems based on glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ) or glucose-dye-oxidoreductase methods]. Due to the potential for falsely elevated glucose readings, only use testing systems that are glucose-specific to test or monitor blood glucose levels in patients receiving maltose-containing parenteral products, including WinRho® SDF Liquid. Carefully review the product information of the blood glucose testing system, including that of the test strips, to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products. If any uncertainty exists, contact the manufacturer of the testing system to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products. 5.1.4 Renal Dysfunction/Failure Acute renal dysfunction/failure, osmotic nephropathy, and death may occur upon use of Immune Globulin Intravenous (IGIV) products, including WinRho® SDF.2 Ensure that patients are not volume depleted before administering WinRho® SDF. For patients at risk of renal dysfunction or failure, including those with any degree of pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, advanced age (above 65 years of age), volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or receiving known nephrotoxic drugs, administer WinRho® SDF at the minimum infusion rate practicable. Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of WinRho® SDF. 5.1.5 Thromboembolic Events Thromboembolic events may occur during or following treatment with WinRho® SDF and other IGIV products.3,4 Patients at risk include those with a history of atherosclerosis, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, impaired cardiac output, coagulation disorders, prolonged periods of immobilization, and/or known/suspected hyperviscosity. Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies. For patients who are at risk of developing thromboembolic events, administer WinRho® SDF at the minimum rate of infusion practicable. 5.1.6 Interference with Serological Testing After administration of WinRho® SDF, a transitory increase of various passively transferred antibodies in the patient’s blood may yield positive serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens (e.g., A, B, C and E) and other blood group antibodies [for example, anti Duffy, anti Kidd (anti JKa) antibodies]5 may cause a positive direct or indirect (Coombs’) test. A large fetomaternal hemorrhage late in pregnancy or following delivery may cause a weak mixed field positive Du test result. Assess such an individual for a large fetomaternal hemorrhage and adjust the dose of WinRho® SDF accordingly. The presence of passively administered anti Rho(D) in maternal or fetal blood can lead to a positive direct Coombs’ test. If there is an uncertainty about the father’s Rh group or immune status, administer WinRho® SDF to the mother. 5.1.7 Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients following IGIV treatment, including WinRho® SDF.6 TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically appear within 1 to 6 hours following administration of blood products. Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reaction. If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies and anti-HLA antibodies in both the product and patient serum. TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support. 5.1.8 Monitoring Laboratory Tests For all ITP patients, blood type, blood count, reticulocyte count, DAT and dipstick urinalysis are recommended before deciding to treat patients with WinRho® SDF. In patients with evidence of hemolysis (reticulocytosis greater than 3%), or patients at risk of hemolysis (positive DAT not attributed to previous immune globulin administration) use other treatments.1 Closely monitor patients administered WinRho® SDF for at least 8 hours post administration and perform a dipstick urinalysis to monitor for hematuria and hemoglobinuria at baseline and then after administration at 2 hours, 4 hours and prior to the end of the monitoring period. If signs and/or symptoms of IVH and its complications are present after anti-D administration, perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing including, but not limited to, CBC (i.e. hemoglobin, platelet counts), haptoglobin, plasma hemoglobin, urine dipstick, assessment of renal function (i.e. BUN, serum creatinine), liver function (i.e. LDH, direct and indirect bilirubin) and DIC specific tests such as D-dimer or Fibrin Degradation Products (FDP) or Fibrin Split Products (FSP). Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output in patients who are at increased risk of developing acute renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1.4)]. Assess renal function in these at-risk patients, including measurement of BUN and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of WinRho® SDF and at appropriate intervals thereafter. If TRALI is suspected in ITP patients, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1.7)]. 5.2 Treatment of ITP 5.2.1 Intravascular Hemolysis (IVH) IVH leading to death has been reported in patients treated for ITP with WinRho® SDF. IVH can lead to clinically compromising anemia and multi-system organ failure including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Serious complications including severe anemia, acute renal insufficiency, renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have also been reported.7,8 Closely monitor patients treated with WinRho® SDF for ITP in a healthcare setting for at least eight hours after administration. Peform a dipstick urinalysis to monitor for hematuria and hemoglobinuria at baseline and then after administration at 2 hours, 4 hours and prior to the end of the monitoring period. Alert patients and monitor for signs and symptoms of IVH including back pain, shaking chills, fever, and discolored urine or hemoglobinuria. Absence of these signs and/or symptoms of IVH within eight hours do not indicate IVH cannot occur subsequently. If signs and/or symptoms of IVH are present or if IVH is suspected after WinRho® SDF administration, perform post-treatment laboratory tests including plasma hemoglobin, haptoglobin, LDH, and plasma bilirubin (direct and indirect). 5.2.2 Hemolysis Although the mechanism of action of WinRho® SDF in the treatment of ITP is not completely understood it is postulated that anti-D binds to the Rho(D) RBC resulting in formation of antibody-coated RBC complexes. Immune-mediated clearance of the antibody-coated RBC complexes would spare the antibody-coated platelets because of the preferential destruction of antibody-coated RBC complexes by the macrophages located in the reticuloendothelial system.9-11 The side effect of this action is a decrease in hemoglobin levels (extravascular hemolysis).7 The pooled data from ITP clinical studies demonstrated a mean decrease from baseline in hemoglobin levels of 1.2 g/dL within 7 days after administration of WinRho®SDF. If the patient has lower than normal hemoglobin levels (less than 10 g/dL), a reduced dose of 125 to 200 international unit/kg (25 to 40 mcg/kg) should be given to minimize the risk of increasing the severity of anemia in the patient. Alternative treatments should be used in patients with hemoglobin levels that are less than 8 g/dL due to the risk of increasing the severity of the anemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Significant anemia may present with pallor, hypotension, or tachycardia while acute renal insufficiency may present with oliguria or anuria, edema and dyspnea. Patients with IVH who develop DIC may exhibit signs and symptoms of increased bruising and prolongation of bleeding time and clotting time which may be difficult to detect in the ITP population. Consequently the diagnosis of this serious complication of IVH is dependent on laboratory testing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1.7)]. Previous uneventful administration of WinRho® SDF does not preclude the possibility of an occurrence of IVH and its complications following any subsequent administration of WinRho® SDF. Have confirmatory laboratory testing on ITP patients presenting with signs and/or symptoms of IVH and its complications after anti-D administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1.7)]. If ITP patients are to be transfused, use Rho(D)-negative red blood cells (PRBCs) so as not to exacerbate ongoing hemolysis. 5.3 Supression of Rh Isoimmunization Do not administer WinRho® SDF to Rho(D)-negative individuals who are Rh immunized as evidenced by an indirect antiglobulin (Coombs’) test revealing the presence of anti-Rho(D) (anti-D) antibody. For postpartum use following an Rh-incompatible pregnancy administer WinRho® SDF to the mother only. Do not administer to the newborn infant."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Discontinue ATGAM if anaphylaxis occurs. (5.1) Serious immune-mediated reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported. To identify those at greatest risk, skin testing before treatment is strongly recommended. (5.1) Monitor patients for concurrent infection, including cytomegalovirus. (5.2) Do not administer live vaccines to patients about to receive, receiving, or after treatment with ATGAM due to a potential of uncontrolled viral replication in the immunosuppressed patient. (5.3) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Serious immune-mediated reactions have been reported with the use of ATGAM. Clinical signs associated with anaphylaxis, other infusion associated reactions, and serum sickness have been reported. Discontinue ATGAM if anaphylaxis occurs. A systemic reaction such as a generalized rash, tachycardia, dyspnea, hypotension, or anaphylaxis precludes any additional administration of ATGAM. Skin Testing To identify those at greatest risk of systemic anaphylaxis, skin testing potential recipients is strongly recommended before commencing treatment. A conservative, conventional approach would first employ epicutaneous (prick) testing with undiluted ATGAM. If the subject does not show a wheal ten minutes after pricking, proceed to intradermal testing with 0.02 mL of a 1:1000 v/v (volume/volume) saline dilution of ATGAM with a separate saline control injection of similar volume. Read the result at 10 minutes: a wheal at the ATGAM site 3 or more mm larger in diameter than that at the saline control site (or a positive prick test) suggests clinical sensitivity and an increased possibility of a systemic allergic reaction should the drug be dosed intravenously. The predictive value of this test has not been proven clinically. Allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis have occurred in patients whose skin test is negative. Also, skin testing done as described above will not predict for later development of serum sickness. In the presence of a locally positive skin test to ATGAM, serious consideration to alternative forms of therapy should be given. The risk to benefit ratio must be weighed. If therapy with ATGAM is deemed appropriate following a locally positive skin test, treatment should be administered in a setting where intensive life support facilities are immediately available and a physician familiar with the treatment of potentially life threatening allergic reactions is in attendance. 5.2 Transmissible Infectious Agents Because ATGAM is made from equine and human blood components, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have been associated with the use of ATGAM. All infections suspected by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Pfizer, Inc. at 1-800-438-1985. Monitor patients for concurrent infection. Some studies have suggested an increase in the incidence of cytomegalovirus infection in patients receiving ATGAM. 5.3 Immunizations Do not administer live vaccines to patients about to receive, receiving, or after treatment with ATGAM. Concomitant administration of ATGAM with live virus vaccines carries a potential of uncontrolled viral replication in the immunosuppressed patient. There is insufficient information to fully define the extent of the risk, or the period of time during which the risk exists. If administered, live viruses may interfere with ATGAM treatment. 5.4 Hepatic and Renal Function Tests In patients with aplastic anemia and other hematologic abnormalities who have received ATGAM, abnormal tests of liver function (SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase) and renal function (serum creatinine) have been observed."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines may be impaired by immune globulin administration; revaccination may be necessary. (7.1) Antibodies in HepaGam B may interfere with some serological tests (7.2) Maltose in HepaGam B may interfere with non-glucose specific blood glucose testing systems. (7.3) 7.1 Live Attenuated Virus Vaccines Immune globulin administration may impair the efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella1,2,7. Vaccination with live virus vaccines should be deferred until approximately three months after administration of HepaGam B, Hepatitis B Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human). Persons who received HepaGam B less than 14 days after live virus vaccination should be revaccinated 3 months after the administration of the immune globulin, unless serologic test results indicate that antibodies were produced1,2. There are no available data on drug interactions of HepaGam B with other medications. 7.2 Drug-Laboratory Interactions: Serological Testing Antibodies present in HepaGam B may interfere with some serological tests. After administration of immune globulins like HepaGam B, a transitory increase of passively transferred antibodies in the patient’s blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing (e.g. Coombs' test). 7.3 Drug-Laboratory Interactions: Blood Glucose Testing HepaGam B contains maltose which can interfere with certain types of blood glucose monitoring systems. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).] Only testing systems that are glucose-specific should be used in patients receiving HepaGam B. This interference can result in falsely elevated glucose readings that can lead to untreated hypoglycemia or to inappropriate insulin administration, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia. The product information of the blood glucose testing system, including that of the test strips, should be carefully reviewed to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products. If any uncertainty exists, contact the manufacturer of the testing system to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common expected adverse drug reactions for intravenous immune globulins like HepaGam B are chills, fever, headaches, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia and moderate low back pain. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cangene Corporation at 1-800-768-2304 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Overall Adverse Reaction Profile The most common expected adverse drug reactions for intravenous immune globulins like HepaGam B are chills, fever, headaches, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia and moderate low back pain7,8. In a clinical trial in liver transplant patients, 2 adverse drug reactions of tremor and hypotension were reported in 2 of 14 patients who received intravenous infusions of HepaGam B8. In studies with healthy volunteers, only 1 adverse drug reaction of nausea was reported in the 70 adult subjects who received an intramuscular administration of HepaGam B8. Although no anaphylactic reactions have been reported following HepaGam B administration, anaphylactic reactions have been reported following the administration of other immune globulin products on rare occasions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 6.2 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hepatitis B-Related Liver Transplantation In an ongoing clinical trial, only 2 adverse drug reactions occurred following the 313 (<1%) HepaGam B infusions in 14 liver transplant patients. A listing of all adverse events (including those assessed as unrelated to study drug) occurring in >10% of patients are summarized in Table 4 below. These adverse events were reported in an interim analysis from a one-year Phase 3 clinical trial examining HepaGam B for the prevention of hepatitis B recurrence following liver transplantation. This study utilized the recommended dosing regimen outlined in Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. The 2 attributed adverse drug reactions of tremor and hypotension were reported in 2 patients. All reactions were associated with a single HepaGam B infusion during the first week post-transplant. All reactions resolved on the same day and did not recur with subsequent HepaGam B infusions.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of transmission of infectious agents from human plasma (5.1) Anaphylactic Precautions (5.2) Interference with non-glucose-specific blood glucose monitoring systems may result in elevated glucose readings that can lead to untreated hypoglycemia or inappropriate insulin administration (5.3) Infusion rate precautions (5.5) IM injections may be contraindicated in patients with coagulation disorders (5.6) 5.1 General HepaGam B is made from human plasma. Products made from human plasma may contain infectious agents, such as viruses and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent. The risk that such products can transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and by inactivating and/or removing certain viruses. The HepaGam B manufacturing process includes a solvent/detergent treatment step (using tri-n-butyl phosphate and Triton X-100) that is effective in inactivating known enveloped viruses such as HBV, HCV, and HIV. HepaGam B is filtered using a Planova 20N Virus Filter that is effective in reducing the levels of some enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. These two processes are designed to increase product safety. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. There is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in such products. ALL infections thought by a physician to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Cangene Corporation at 1-800-768-2304. The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient. 5.2 Anaphylactic Precautions Although allergic reactions have not been reported following HepaGam B administration [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ], the product should be administered only in a setting where appropriate equipment and personnel trained in the management of acute anaphylaxis are available. If hypotension or anaphylaxis occurs, the administration of HepaGam B should be discontinued immediately and supportive care given as needed. 5.3 Interference with Blood Glucose Testing The maltose contained in HepaGam B can interfere with some types of blood glucose monitoring systems, i.e., those based on the glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinequinone (GDH-PQQ) method. This can result in falsely elevated glucose readings and, consequently, in the inappropriate administration of insulin, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia. Cases of true hypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglycemic state is masked by falsely elevated results. 5.4 Monitoring: Serum anti-HBs Antibody Levels Liver transplant patients should be monitored regularly for serum anti-HBs antibody levels using a quantitative assay [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.5 Infusion Reactions Certain adverse drug reactions may be related to the rate of infusion. The recommended infusion rate given under Dosage and Administration (2.1) must be closely followed. Patients must be closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptoms throughout the infusion period and immediately following an infusion. 5.6 Coagulation Disorders For postexposure prophylaxis indications, HepaGam B must be administered intramuscularly only. In patients who have severe thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injections, HepaGam B should be given only if the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks."
