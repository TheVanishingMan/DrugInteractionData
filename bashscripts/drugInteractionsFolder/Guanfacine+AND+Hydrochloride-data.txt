        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 14 contains clinically important drug interactions with guanfacine extended-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Table 14: Clinically Important Drug Interactions: Effect of other Drugs on Guanfacine Extended-Release Tablets Concomitant Drug Name or Drug Class Clinical Rationale and Magnitude of Drug Interaction Clinical Recommendation CYP3A4 inhibitors, e.g.,ketoconazole Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be significantly affected resulting in a 200% increase in exposure Consider dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] CYP3A4 inducers, e.g., rifampin Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be significantly affected resulting in a 60% decrease in exposure Consider dose increase [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] •Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase guanfacine exposure. Decrease guanfacine to 50% of target dosage when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (2.7). •Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease guanfacine exposure.Based on patient response, consider titrating guanfacine dosage up to double the target dosage over 1 to 2 weeks (2.7)."

Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate In the monotherapy pediatric, short-term, controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2), the maximum mean changes from baseline in seated systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse were −5.4 mmHg, −3.4 mmHg, and −5.5 bpm, respectively, for all doses combined (generally one week after reaching target doses). For the respective fixed doses 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day or 4 mg/day the maximum mean changes in seated systolic blood pressure were -4.3 mmHg, -5.5 mmHg, -5.4 mmHg and -8.2 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were -3.4 mmHg, -3.3 mmHg, -4.4 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were -4.8 bpm, -3.1 bpm, -6.5 bpm and -8.6 bpm. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and none in the placebo group. These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials (Studies 4 and 5). In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with guanfacine extended-release tablets as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric patients in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies. Discontinuation of Treatment In a maintenance of efficacy study in children and adolescents [see Clinical Studies (14)], increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, of approximately 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg respectively, above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets. The increases in blood pressure were observed in some individuals at the end of the follow up period which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose. Mean increases in pulse of approximately 1.5 bpm were observed at approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets and then decreased to baseline 4 weeks later. Effects on Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data. Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets had a mean increase in weight of 0.5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period. Patients receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets for at least 12 months in open-label studies gained an average of 8 kg in weight and 8 cm (3 in) in height. The height, weight, and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long-term studies compared to when they began receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Table 13 includes additional adverse reactions observed in short-term, placebo-controlled and long-term, open-label clinical studies not included elsewhere in section 6.1, listed by organ system. Table 13: Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Body System Adverse Reaction Cardiac Atrioventricular block General Asthenia, chest pain Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity Investigations Increased alanine amino transferase Nervous system Convulsion Renal Increased urinary frequency Vascular Hypertension, pallor 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of guanfacine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the postmarketing study and/or reported spontaneously, not included in section 6.1, include: General: edema, malaise, tremor Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia Central Nervous System: paresthesias, vertigo Eye Disorders: blurred vision Musculo-Skeletal System: arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia Psychiatric: confusion, hallucinations Reproductive System, Male: impotence Respiratory System: dyspnea Skin and Appendages: alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash Special Senses: alterations in taste"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope: Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients at risk for hypotension, heart block, bradycardia, syncope, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease or chronic renal failure. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Avoid concomitant use of drugs with additive effects unless clinically indicated. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated (5.1). •Sedation and somnolence: Occur commonly with guanfacine extended-release tablets. Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to guanfacine extended-release tablets (5.2). •Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: May worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently (5.3). 5.1 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate guanfacine extended-release tablets slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope. 5.2 Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Before using guanfacine extended-release tablets with other centrally active depressants, consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol. 5.3 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities The sympatholytic action of guanfacine extended-release tablets may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate guanfacine extended-release tablets slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs."

A total of 2,028 subjects have been exposed to INTUNIV while participating in clinical trials. This includes 1,533 patients from completed studies in children and adolescents, and 495 subjects in completed studies in adult healthy volunteers. ® The mean duration of exposure of 446 patients that previously participated in two 2-year, open-label long-term studies was approximately 10 months. Monotherapy Trials The most commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% and at least twice the rate for placebo) in the monotherapy trials (Studies 1 and 2) with INTUNIV were: somnolence, fatigue, nausea, lethargy, and hypotension. Most Common Adverse Reactions - ® Twelve percent (12%) of patients receiving INTUNIV discontinued from the monotherapy clinical studies (Studies 1 and 2) due to adverse reactions, compared to 4% in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of INTUNIV -treated patients from the studies were somnolence/sedation (6%) and fatigue (2%). Less common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (occurring in approximately 1% of patients) included: hypotension, headache, and dizziness. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation - ® ® Adjunctive Trial The most commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% and at least twice the rate for placebo) in the adjunctive trial with INTUNIV were: somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, and abdominal pain. Most Common Adverse Reactions - ® In the adjunctive clinical study, 3% of patients receiving INTUNIV discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 1% in the placebo group. Each adverse reaction leading to discontinuation occurred in less than 1% of INTUNIV -treated patients. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation – ® ® Short Term Monotherapy Clinical Studies - Two short-term, placebo-controlled, double-blind pivotal studies (Studies 1 and 2) were conducted in children and adolescents with ADHD, using fixed doses of INTUNIV (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg/day). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in ≥ 2% of patients) that were considered drug-related and reported in a greater percentage of patients taking INTUNIV compared to patients taking placebo are shown in Table 2. Adverse reactions that were dose-related include: somnolence/sedation, abdominal pain, dizziness, hypotension, dry mouth and constipation.

In an 8-week, placebo-controlled study in children 6-12 years of age with ADHD in which INTUNIV was dosed once (1-4 mg/day) in the morning or evening (Study 4), the safety profile was consistent with the once daily morning dosing of INTUNIV . ® ® Short Term Adjunctive Clinical Study - A 8-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-optimized pivotal study (Study 3) was conducted in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD who were identified as having a sub-optimal response to psychostimulants. Patients received INTUNIV (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg/day) or placebo, dosed in the morning or in the evening, in combination with their morning dose of psychostimulant. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in ≥ 2% of patients in the overall INTUNIV group) that were reported in a greater percentage of patients taking INTUNIV compared to patients taking placebo are shown in Table 3.

These changes were dose dependent. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the INTUNIV group and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the INTUNIV group and none in the placebo group. In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with INTUNIV as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric subjects in the clinical program.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. An open-label post-marketing study involving 21,718 patients was conducted to assess the safety of guanfacine (as the hydrochloride) 1 mg/day given at bedtime for 28 days. Guanfacine was administered with or without other antihypertensive agents. Adverse events reported in the post-marketing study at an incidence greater than 1% included dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, headache and nausea. The most commonly reported adverse events in this study were the same as those observed in controlled clinical trials.

For the respective fixed doses 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day or 4 mg/day the maximum mean changes in seated systolic blood pressure were -4.3 mmHg, -5.5 mmHg, -5.4 mmHg and -8.2 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were -3.4 mmHg, -3.3 mmHg, -4.4 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were -4.8 bpm, -3.1 bpm, -6.5 bpm and -8.6 bpm. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and none in the placebo group. These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials (Studies 4 and 5). In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with guanfacine extended-release tablets as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric patients in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies. Discontinuation of Treatment In a maintenance of efficacy study in children and adolescents [see Clinical Studies (14)], increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, of approximately 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg respectively, above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets. The increases in blood pressure were observed in some individuals at the end of the follow up period which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose. Mean increases in pulse of approximately 1.5 bpm were observed at approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets and then decreased to baseline 4 weeks later. Effects on Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data. Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets had a mean increase in weight of 0.5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period. Patients receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets for at least 12 months in open-label studies gained an average of 8 kg in weight and 8 cm (3 in) in height. The height, weight, and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long-term studies compared to when they began receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope: Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients at risk for hypotension, heart block, bradycardia, syncope, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease or chronic renal failure. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Avoid concomitant use of drugs with additive effects unless clinically indicated. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated (5.1). •Sedation and somnolence: Occur commonly with guanfacine extended-release tablets. Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to guanfacine extended-release tablets (5.2). •Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: May worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently (5.3). 5.1 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate guanfacine extended-release tablets slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope. 5.2 Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Before using guanfacine extended-release tablets with other centrally active depressants, consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol. 5.3 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities The sympatholytic action of guanfacine extended-release tablets may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate guanfacine extended-release tablets slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be affected significantly by CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (Figure 1). Dose adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Guanfacine does not significantly affect exposures of methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine when coadministered (Figure 2). Therefore, no dose adjustments in methylphenidate or lisdexamfetamine are necessary. Figure 1: Impact of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Guanfacine Extended-Release Figure 2: Impact of Guanfacine Extended-Release on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Other Drugs Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Coadministration increases guanfacine exposure. Guanfacine dose should be limited to no more than 2 mg/day. When discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, guanfacine dose should be doubled based on patient tolerability. The maximum dose should not exceed 4 mg/day (2.7 and 7). Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin): Coadministration decreases guanfacine exposure. Guanfacine dose may be titrated up to 8 mg/day. When discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers, guanfacine dose should be decreased by half in 1 to 2 weeks based on patient tolerability. The maximum dose should not exceed 4 mg/day (2.7 and 7). 15a84d83-figure-05 15a84d83-figure-06"

A total of 2,028 subjects have been exposed to guanfacine extended-releasewhile participating in clinical trials. This includes 1,533 patients from completed studies in children and adolescents, and 495 subjects in completed studies in adult healthy volunteers. The mean duration of exposure of 446 patients that previously participated in two 2-year, open-label long-term studies was approximately 10 months. Monotherapy Trials Most Common Adverse Reactions - The most commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 5% and at least twice the rate for placebo) in the monotherapy trials (Studies 1 and 2) with guanfacine extended-releasewere: somnolence, fatigue, nausea, lethargy, and hypotension. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation - Twelve percent (12%) of patients receiving guanfacine extended-release discontinued from the monotherapy clinical studies (Studies 1 and 2) due to adverse reactions, compared to 4% in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release-treated patients from the studies were somnolence/sedation (6%) and fatigue (2%). Less common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (occurring in approximately 1% of patients) included: hypotension, headache, and dizziness. Adjunctive Trial Most Common Adverse Reactions - The most commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 5% and at least twice the rate for placebo) in the adjunctive trial with guanfacine extended-release were: somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, and abdominal pain. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation - In the adjunctive clinical study, 3% of patients receiving guanfacine extended-release discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 1% in the placebo group. Each adverse reaction leading to discontinuation occurred in less than 1% of guanfacine extended-release-treated patients. Short Term Monotherapy Clinical Studies Common Adverse Reactions - Two short-term, placebo-controlled, double-blind pivotal studies (Studies 1 and 2) were conducted in children and adolescents with ADHD, using fixed doses of guanfacine extended-release(1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg/day). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of patients) that were considered drug-related and reported in a greater percentage of patients taking guanfacine extended-releasecompared to patients taking placebo are shown in Table 2. Adverse reactions that were dose-related include: somnolence/sedation, abdominal pain, dizziness, hypotension, dry mouth and constipation.

Short Term Adjunctive Clinical Study Common Adverse Reactions - A 8-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-optimized pivotal study (Study 3) was conducted in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD who were identified as having a sub-optimal response to psychostimulants. Patients received guanfacine extended-release (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg/day) or placebo, dosed in the morning or in the evening, in combination with their morning dose of psychostimulant. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of patients in the overall guanfacine extended-release group) that were reported in a greater percentage of patients taking guanfacine extended-release compared to patients taking placebo are shown in Table 3.

These changes were dose dependent. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the guanfacine extended-release group and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the guanfacine extended-release group and none in the placebo group. In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with guanfacine extended-release as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric subjects in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Table 4 includes additional adverse reactions observed in short-term, placebo-controlled and long-term, open-label clinical studies not included elsewhere in section 6.1, listed by organ system.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. An open-label postmarketing study involving 21,718 patients was conducted to assess the safety of guanfacine (as the hydrochloride) 1 mg/day given at bedtime for 28 days. Guanfacine was administered with or without other antihypertensive agents. Adverse events reported in the postmarketing study at an incidence greater than 1% included dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, headache and nausea. The most commonly reported adverse events in this study were the same as those observed in controlled clinical trials. Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the postmarketing study and/or reported spontaneously, not included in section 6.1, include: General: edema, malaise, tremor Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia Central Nervous System: paresthesias, vertigo Eye Disorders: blurred vision Musculo-Skeletal System: arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia Psychiatric: confusion, hallucinations Reproductive System, Male: impotence Respiratory System: dyspnea Skin and Appendages: alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash Special Senses: alterations in taste"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope: Use guanfacine extended-release with caution in patients at risk for hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, or syncope (e.g., those taking antihypertensives). Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated (5.1). Sedation and somnolence: Occur commonly with guanfacine extended-release. Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to guanfacine extended-release (5.2). 5.1 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Treatment with guanfacine extended-release can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Use guanfacine extended-releasewith caution in patients with a history of hypotension, heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, or who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration. Use guanfacine extended-release with caution in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. 5.2 Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Before using guanfacine extended-release with other centrally active depressants (such as phenothiazines, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines), consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with guanfacine extended-release. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be affected significantly by CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (Figure 1). Dose adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. Guanfacine does not significantly affect exposures of methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine when coadministered (Figure 2). Therefore, no dose adjustments in methylphenidate or lisdexamfetamine are necessary. Figure 1: Impact of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Guanfacine Extended-Release Figure 2: Impact of Guanfacine Extended-Release on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Other Drugs Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Coadministration increases guanfacine exposure. Guanfacine dose should be limited to no more than 2 mg/day. When discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, guanfacine dose should be doubled based on patient tolerability. The maximum dose should not exceed 4 mg/day (2.7 and 7). Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin): Coadministration decreases guanfacine exposure. Guanfacine dose may be titrated up to 8 mg/day. When discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers, guanfacine dose should be decreased by half in 1 to 2 weeks based on patient tolerability. The maximum dose should not exceed 4 mg/day (2.7 and 7). 15a84d83-figure-05 15a84d83-figure-06"

Most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 5% and at least twice placebo rate) in the adjunctive trial: somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, and abdominal pain (6). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-432-8534 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. A total of 2,028 subjects have been exposed to guanfacine extended-releasewhile participating in clinical trials. This includes 1,533 patients from completed studies in children and adolescents, and 495 subjects in completed studies in adult healthy volunteers. The mean duration of exposure of 446 patients that previously participated in two 2-year, open-label long-term studies was approximately 10 months. Monotherapy Trials Most Common Adverse Reactions - The most commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 5% and at least twice the rate for placebo) in the monotherapy trials (Studies 1 and 2) with guanfacine extended-releasewere: somnolence, fatigue, nausea, lethargy, and hypotension. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation - Twelve percent (12%) of patients receiving guanfacine extended-release discontinued from the monotherapy clinical studies (Studies 1 and 2) due to adverse reactions, compared to 4% in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release-treated patients from the studies were somnolence/sedation (6%) and fatigue (2%). Less common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (occurring in approximately 1% of patients) included: hypotension, headache, and dizziness. Adjunctive Trial Most Common Adverse Reactions - The most commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 5% and at least twice the rate for placebo) in the adjunctive trial with guanfacine extended-release were: somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, and abdominal pain. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation - In the adjunctive clinical study, 3% of patients receiving guanfacine extended-release discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 1% in the placebo group. Each adverse reaction leading to discontinuation occurred in less than 1% of guanfacine extended-release-treated patients. Short Term Monotherapy Clinical Studies Common Adverse Reactions - Two short-term, placebo-controlled, double-blind pivotal studies (Studies 1 and 2) were conducted in children and adolescents with ADHD, using fixed doses of guanfacine extended-release(1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg/day). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of patients) that were considered drug-related and reported in a greater percentage of patients taking guanfacine extended-releasecompared to patients taking placebo are shown in Table 2. Adverse reactions that were dose-related include: somnolence/sedation, abdominal pain, dizziness, hypotension, dry mouth and constipation.

For the respective fixed doses 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day or 4 mg/day the maximum mean changes in seated systolic blood pressure were -4.3 mmHg, -5.5 mmHg, -5.4 mmHg and -8.2 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were -3.4 mmHg, -3.3 mmHg, -4.4 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were -4.8bpm, -3.1 bpm, -6.5 bpm and -8.6 bpm. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the guanfacine extended-release tabletsgroup and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and none in the placebo group. These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials (Studies 4 and 5). In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with guanfacine extended-release tablets as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric patients in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies. Discontinuation of Treatment In a maintenance of efficacy study in children and adolescents [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 ) ] , increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, of approximately 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg respectively, above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets. The increases in blood pressure were observed in some individuals at the end of the follow up period which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose. Mean increases in pulse of approximately 1.5 bpm were observed at approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of guanfacine extended-release tabletsand then decreased to baseline 4 weeks later. Effects on Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data. Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets had a mean increase in weight of 0.5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period. Patients receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets for at least 12 months in open-label studies gained an average of 8 kg inweight and 8 cm (3 in) in height. The height, weight, and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long-term studies compared to when they began receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Table 13 includes additional adverse reactions observed in short-term, placebo-controlled and long-term, open-label clinical studies not included elsewhere in section 6.1, listed by organ system. Table 13: Other adverse reactions observed in clinical studies Body System Adverse Reaction Cardiac Atrioventricular block General Asthenia, chest pain Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity Investigations Increased alanine amino transferase Nervous system Convulsion Renal Increased urinary frequency Vascular Hypotension, pallor 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of guanfacine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the post-marketing study and/or reported spontaneously, not included in section 6.1, include: General : edema, malaise, tremor Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia Central Nervous System : paresthesias, vertigo Eye Disorders : blurred vision Musculo-Skeletal System : arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia Psychiatric : confusion, hallucinations Reproductive System, Male : impotence Respiratory System : dyspnea Skin and Appendages : alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash Special Senses : alterations in taste"
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope: Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients at risk for hypotension, heart block, bradycardia, syncope, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease or chronic renal failure. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Avoid concomitant use of drugs with additive effects unless clinically indicated. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated (5.1). •Sedation and somnolence: Occur commonly with guanfacine extended-release tablets. Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to guanfacine extended-release tablets (5.2) •Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: May worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently (5.3). 5.1 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate guanfacine extended-release tablets slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope. 5.2 Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Before using guanfacine extended-release tablets with other centrally active depressants, consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets . Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol. 5.3 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities The sympatholytic action of guanfacine extended-release tablets may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate guanfacine extended-release tablets slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs."

        "Drug Interactions The potential for increased sedation when guanfacine is given with other CNS-depressant drugs should be appreciated. The administration of guanfacine concomitantly with a known microsomal enzyme inducer (phenobarbital or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration. In such cases, therefore, more frequent dosing may be required to achieve or maintain the desired hypotensive response. Further, if guanfacine is to be discontinued in such patients, careful tapering of the dosage may be necessary in order to avoid rebound phenomena (see Rebound above)."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions noted with guanfacine are similar to those of other drugs of the central α2-adrenoreceptor agonist class: dry mouth, sedation (somnolence), weakness (asthenia), dizziness, constipation, and impotence. While the reactions are common, most are mild and tend to disappear on continued dosing. Skin rash with exfoliation has been reported in a few cases; although clear cause and effect relationships to guanfacine could not be established, should a rash occur, guanfacine should be discontinued and the patient monitored appropriately. In the dose-response monotherapy study described under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, the frequency of the most commonly observed adverse reactions showed a dose relationship from 0.5 mg to 3 mg as follows: Adverse Reaction Placebo n = 59 0.5 mg n = 60 1 mg n = 61 2 mg n = 60 3 mg n = 59 Dry Mouth 0% 10% 10% 42% 54% Somnolence 8% 5% 10% 13% 39% Asthenia 0% 2% 3% 7% 3% Dizziness 8% 12% 2% 8% 15% Headache 8% 13% 7% 5% 3% Impotence 0% 0% 0% 7% 3% Constipation 0% 2% 0% 5% 15% Fatigue 2% 2% 5% 8% 10% The percent of patients who dropped out because of adverse reactions are shown below for each dosage group.

In a second 12-week, placebo-controlled combination therapy study in which the dose could be adjusted upward to 3 mg per day in 1 mg increments at 3-week intervals, i.e., a setting more similar to ordinary clinical use, the most commonly recorded reactions were: dry mouth, 47%; constipation, 16%; fatigue, 12%; somnolence, 10%; asthenia, 6%; dizziness, 6%; headache, 4%; and insomnia, 4%. Reasons for dropouts among patients who received guanfacine were: somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, impotence, constipation, confusion, depression, and palpitations. In the clonidine/guanfacine comparison described in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, the most common adverse reactions noted were as follows: Adverse Reactions Guanfacine (n = 279) Clonidine (n = 278) Dry Mouth 30% 37% Somnolence 21% 35% Dizziness 11% 8% Constipation 10% 5% Fatigue 9% 8% Headache 4% 4% Insomnia 4% 3% Adverse reactions occurring in 3% or less of patients in the three controlled trials of guanfacine with a diuretic were: Cardiovascular: bradycardia, palpitations, substernal pain Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dysphagia, nausea CNS: amnesia, confusion, depression, insomnia, libido decrease ENT disorders: rhinitis, taste perversion, tinnitus Eye disorders: conjunctivitis, iritis, vision disturbance Musculoskeletal: leg cramps, hypokinesia Respiratory: dyspnea Dermatologic: dermatitis, pruritus, purpura, sweating Urogenital: testicular disorder, urinary incontinence Other: malaise, paresthesia, paresis Adverse reaction reports tend to decrease over time. In an open-label trial of one year’s duration, 580 hypertensive subjects were given guanfacine, titrated to achieve goal blood pressure, alone (51%), with diuretic (38%), with beta blocker (3%), with diuretic plus beta blocker (6%) or with diuretic plus vasodilator (2%). The mean daily dose of guanfacine reached was 4.7 mg.

Postmarketing Experience An open-label postmarketing study involving 21,718 patients was conducted to assess the safety of guanfacine tablets 1 mg/day given at bedtime for 28 days. Guanfacine was administered with or without other antihypertensive agents. Adverse events reported in the postmarketing study at an incidence greater than 1% included dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, headache and nausea. The most commonly reported adverse events in this study were the same as those observed in controlled clinical trials. Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the postmarketing study and/or reported spontaneously include: Body as a Whole: asthenia, chest pain, edema, malaise, tremor Cardiovascular: bradycardia, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Central Nervous System: paresthesias, vertigo Eye Disorders: blurred vision Gastrointestinal System: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia Liver and Biliary System: abnormal liver function tests Musculo-Skeletal System: arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia Psychiatric: agitation, anxiety, confusion, depression, insomnia, nervousness Reproductive System, Male: impotence Respiratory System: dyspnea Skin and Appendages: alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash Special Senses: alterations in taste Urinary System: nocturia, urinary frequency Rare, serious disorders with no definitive cause and effect relationship to guanfacine have been reported spontaneously and/or in the postmarketing study. These events include acute renal failure, cardiac fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, heart block, and myocardial infarction."

In the clonidine/guanfacine comparison described in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, the most common adverse reactions noted were as follows: Adverse Reactions Guanfacine (n=279) Clonidine (n=278) Dry Mouth 30 % 37% Somnolence 21% 35% Dizziness 11% 8% Constipation 10% 5% Fatigue 9% 8% Headache 4% 4% Insomnia 4% 3% Adverse reactions occurring in 3% or less of patients in the three controlled trials of guanfacine hydrochloride with a diuretic were: • Cardiovascular: bradycardia, palpitations, substernal pain • Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dysphagia, nausea • CNS: amnesia, confusion, depression, insomnia, libido decrease • ENT disorders: rhinitis, taste perversion, tinnitus • Eye disorders: conjunctivitis, iritis, vision disturbance • Musculoskeletal: leg cramps, hypokinesia • Respiratory: dyspnea • Dermatologic: dermatitis, pruritus, purpura, sweating • Urogenital: testicular disorder, urinary incontinence • Other: malaise, paresthesia, paresis Adverse reaction reports tend to decrease over time. In an open-label trial of one year’s duration, 580 hypertensive subjects were given guanfacine, titrated to achieve goal blood pressure, alone (51%), with diuretic (38%), with beta blocker (3%), with diuretic plus beta blocker (6%), or with diuretic plus vasodilator (2%). The mean daily dose of guanfacine reached was 4.7 mg. Adverse Reaction Incidence of adverse reactions at any time during the study Incidence of adverse reactions at end of one year n=580 n=580 Dry Mouth 60% 15% Drowsiness 33% 6% Dizziness 15% 1% Constipation 14% 3% Weakness 5% 1% Headache 4% 0.2% Insomnia 5% 0% There were 52 (8.9%) dropouts due to adverse effects in this 1-year trial. The causes were: dry mouth (n = 20), weakness (n = 12), constipation (n = 7), somnolence (n = 3), nausea (n = 3), orthostatic hypotension (n = 2), insomnia (n = 1), rash (n = 1), nightmares (n = 1), headache (n = 1) and depression (n = 1). Postmarketing Experience An open-label postmarketing study involving 21,718 patients was conducted to assess the safety of guanfacine hydrochloride 1 mg/day given at bedtime for 28 days. Guanfacine was administered with or without other antihypertensive agents. Adverse events reported in the postmarketing study at an incidence greater than 1% included dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, headache and nausea. The most commonly reported adverse events in this study were the same as those observed in controlled clinical trials. Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the postmarketing study and/or reported spontaneously include: • Body as a Whole: asthenia, chest pain, edema, malaise, tremor • Cardiovascular: bradycardia, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia • Central Nervous System: paresthesias, vertigo • Eye Disorders: blurred vision • Gastrointestinal System: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia • Liver and Biliary System: abnormal liver function tests • Musculo-Skeletal System: arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia • Psychiatric: agitation, anxiety, confusion, depression, insomnia, nervousness • Reproductive System, Male: impotence • Respiratory System: dyspnea • Skin and Appendages: alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash • Special Senses: alterations in taste • Urinary System: nocturia, urinary frequency Rare, serious disorders with no definitive cause and effect relationship to guanfacine have been reported spontaneously and/or in the postmarketing study. These events include acute renal failure, cardiac fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, heart block, and myocardial infarction."

        "Drug Interactions The potential for increased sedation when guanfacine is given with other CNS-depressant drugs should be appreciated. The administration of guanfacine concomitantly with a known microsomal enzyme inducer (phenobarbital or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration. In such cases, therefore, more frequent dosing may be required to achieve or maintain the desired hypotensive response. Further, if guanfacine is to be discontinued in such patients, careful tapering of the dosage may be necessary in order to avoid rebound phenomena (see Rebound above). Anticoagulants Ten patients who were stabilized on oral anticoagulants were given guanfacine, 1-2 mg/day, for 4 weeks. No changes were observed in the degree of anticoagulation. In several well-controlled studies, guanfacine was administered together with diuretics with no drug interactions reported. In the long-term safety studies, guanfacine was given concomitantly with many drugs without evidence of any interactions. The principal drugs given (number of patients in parentheses) were: cardiac glycosides (115), sedatives and hypnotics (103), coronary vasodilators (52), oral hypoglycemics (45), cough and cold preparations (45), NSAIDs (38), antihyperlipidemics (29), antigout drugs (24), oral contraceptives (18), bronchodilators (13), insulin (10), and beta blockers (10). Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions No laboratory test abnormalities related to the use of guanfacine have been identified."

        "Drug Interactions: The potential for increased sedation when guanfacine is given with other CNS-depressant drugs should be appreciated. The administration of guanfacine concomitantly with a known microsomal enzyme inducer (phenobarbital or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration. In such cases, therefore, more frequent dosing may be required to achieve or maintain the desired hypotensive response. Further, if guanfacine is to be discontinued in such patients, careful tapering of the dosage may be necessary in order to avoid rebound phenomena (see Rebound above)."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions noted with guanfacine are similar to those of other drugs of the central α2 adrenoreceptor agonist class: dry mouth, sedation (somnolence), weakness (asthenia), dizziness, constipation, and impotence. While the reactions are common, most are mild and tend to disappear on continued dosing. Skin rash with exfoliation has been reported in a few cases; although clear cause and effect relationships to guanfacine could not be established, should a rash occur, guanfacine should be discontinued and the patient monitored appropriately. In the dose-response monotherapy study described under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , the frequency of the most commonly observed adverse reactions showed a dose relationship from 0.5 to 3 mg as follows: Adverse Placebo 0.5 mg 1 mg 2 mg 3 mg Reaction n=59 n=60 n=61 n=60 n=59 Dry Mouth 0% 10% 10% 42% 54% Somnolence 8% 5% 10% 13% 39% Asthenia 0% 2% 3% 7% 3% Dizziness 8% 12% 2% 8% 15% Headache 8% 13% 7% 5% 3% Impotence 0% 0% 0% 7% 3% Constipation 0% 2% 0% 5% 15% Fatigue 2% 2% 5% 8% 10% The percent of patients who dropped out because of adverse reactions are shown below for each dosage group. Placebo 0.5 mg 1 mg 2 mg 3 mg Percent dropouts 0% 2% 5% 13% 32% The most common reasons for dropouts among patients who received guanfacine were dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, and constipation. In the 12-week, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of guanfacine administered with 25 mg chlorthalidone at bedtime, the frequency of the most commonly observed adverse reactions showed a clear dose relationship from 0.5 to 3 mg as follows: Placebo 0.5 mg 1 mg 2 mg 3 mg Adverse Reaction n = 73 n = 72 n = 72 n = 72 n = 72 Dry mouth 5 (7%) 4 (5%) 6 (8%) 8 (11%) 20 (28%) Somnolence 1 (1%) 3 (4%) 0 (0%) 1 (1%) 10 (14%) Asthenia 0 (0%) 2 (3%) 0 (0%) 2 (2%) 7 (10%) Dizziness 2 (2%) 1 (1%) 3 (4%) 6 (8%) 3 (4%) Headache 3 (4%) 4 (3%) 3 (4%) 1 (1%) 2 (2%) Impotence 1 (1%) 1 (0%) 0 (0%) 1 (1%) 3 (4%) Constipation 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 1 (1%) 1 (1%) Fatigue 3 (3%) 2 (3%) 2 (3%) 5 (6%) 3 (4%) There were 41 premature terminations because of adverse reactions in this study.

In a second 12-week placebo-controlled combination therapy study in which the dose could be adjusted upward to 3 mg per day in 1-mg increments at 3-week intervals, i.e., a setting more similar to ordinary clinical use, the most commonly recorded reactions were: dry mouth, 47%; constipation, 16%; fatigue, 12%; somnolence, 10%; asthenia, 6%; dizziness, 6%; headache, 4%; and insomnia, 4%. Reasons for dropouts among patients who received guanfacine were: somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, impotence, constipation, confusion, depression, and palpitations. In the clonidine/guanfacine comparison described in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , the most common adverse reactions noted were as follows: Guanfacine Clonidine Adverse Reactions (n=279) (n=278) Dry Mouth 30% 37% Somnolence 21% 35% Dizziness 11% 8% Constipation 10% 5% Fatigue 9% 8% Headache 4% 4% Insomnia 4% 3% Adverse reactions occurring in 3% or less of patients in the three controlled trials of guanfacine with a diuretic were: Cardiovascular - bradycardia, palpitations, substernal pain Gastrointestinal - abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dysphagia, nausea CNS - amnesia, confusion, depression, insomnia, libido decrease ENT disorders - rhinitis, taste perversion, tinnitus Eye disorders - conjunctivitis, iritis, vision disturbance Musculoskeletal - leg cramps, hypokinesia Respiratory - dyspnea Dermatologic - dermatitis, pruritus, purpura, sweating Urogenital - testicular disorder, urinary incontinence Other - malaise, paresthesia, paresis Adverse reaction reports tend to decrease over time. In an open-label trial of one year’s duration, 580 hypertensive subjects were given guanfacine, titrated to achieve goal blood pressure, alone (51%), with diuretic (38%), with beta blocker (3%), with diuretic plus beta blocker (6%), or with diuretic plus vasodilator (2%).

Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate In the monotherapy pediatric, short-term, controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2), the maximum mean changes from baseline in seated systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse were −5.4 mmHg, −3.4 mmHg, and −5.5 bpm, respectively, for all doses combined (generally one week after reaching target doses). For the respective fixed doses 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day or 4 mg/day the maximum mean changes in seated systolic blood pressure were -4.3 mmHg, -5.5 mmHg, -5.4 mmHg and -8.2 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were -3.4 mmHg, -3.3 mmHg, -4.4 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were ­ 4.8 bpm, -3.1 bpm, -6.5 bpm and -8.6 bpm. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and none in the placebo group. These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials (Studies 4 and 5). In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with guanfacine extended-release tablets as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric patients in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies. Discontinuation of Treatment In a maintenance of efficacy study in children and adolescents [see Clinical Studies (14)], increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, of approximately 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg respectively, above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets. The increases in blood pressure were observed in some individuals at the end of the follow up period which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose. Mean increases in pulse of approximately 1.5 bpm were observed at approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets and then decreased to baseline 4 weeks later. Effects on Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data. Patients taking guanfacine extended-release tablets had a mean increase in weight of 0.5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period. Patients receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets for at least 12 months in open-label studies gained an average of 8 kg in weight and 8 cm (3 in) in height. The height, weight, and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long-term studies compared to when they began receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Table 13 includes additional adverse reactions observed in short-term, placebo-controlled and long-term, open-label clinical studies not included elsewhere in section 6.1, listed by organ system. Table 13: Other adverse reactions observed in clinical studies Body System Adverse Reaction Cardiac Atrioventricular block General Asthenia, chest pain Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity Investigations Increased alanine amino transferase Nervous system Convulsion Renal Increased urinary frequency Vascular Hypertension, pallor 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of guanfacine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the post-marketing study and/or reported spontaneously, not included in section 6.1, include: General: edema, malaise, tremor Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia Central Nervous System: paresthesias, vertigo Eye Disorders: blurred vision Musculo -Skeletal System: arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia Psychiatric: confusion, hallucinations Reproductive System, Male: impotence Respiratory System: dyspnea Skin and Appendages: alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash Special Senses: alterations in taste"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope: Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients at risk for hypotension, heart block, bradycardia, syncope, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease or chronic renal failure. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Avoid concomitant use of drugs with additive effects unless clinically indicated. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated (5.1). •Sedation and somnolence: Occur commonly with guanfacine extended-release tablets. Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to guanfacine extended-release tablets (5.2). •Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: May worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently (5.3). 5.1 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate guanfacine extended-release tablets slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope. 5.2 Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Before using guanfacine extended-release tablets with other centrally active depressants, consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol. 5.3 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities The sympatholytic action of guanfacine may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate guanfacine extended-release tablets slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs."

Table 14: Clinically Important Drug Interactions: Effect of other Drugs on INTUNIV® Concomitant Drug Name or Drug Class Clinical Rationale and Magnitude of Drug Interaction Clinical Recommendation CYP3A4 inhibitors, e.g., ketoconazole Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be significantly affected resulting in a 200% increase in exposure Consider dose reduction [see Dosage and administration (2.7)] CYP3A4 inducers, e.g., rifampin Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be significantly affected resulting in a 60% decrease in exposure Consider dose increase [see Dosage and administration (2.7)] Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase guanfacine exposure. Decrease INTUNIV ® to 50% of target dosage when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (2.7). Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease guanfacine exposure. Based on patient response, consider titrating INTUNIV dosage up to double the target dosage over 1 to 2 weeks (2.7)."

For the respective fixed doses 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day or 4 mg/day the maximum mean changes in seated systolic blood pressure were -4.3 mmHg, -5.5 mmHg, -5.4 mmHg and -8.2 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were -3.4 mmHg, -3.3 mmHg, -4.4 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were -4.8 bpm, -3.1 bpm, -6.5 bpm and -8.6 bpm. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the INTUNIV® group and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the INTUNIV® group and none in the placebo group. These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials (Studies 4 and 5). In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with INTUNIV® as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open-label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric patients in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies. Discontinuation of Treatment Blood pressure and pulse may increase following discontinuation of INTUNIV®. In postmarketing experience, hypertensive encephalopathy has been very rarely reported upon abrupt discontinuation of INTUNIV® [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In a maintenance of efficacy study in children and adolescents [see Clinical Studies (14)], increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, of approximately 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg respectively, above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation of INTUNIV®. The increases in blood pressure were observed in some individuals at the end of the follow up period which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose. Mean increases in pulse of approximately 1.5 bpm were observed at approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of INTUNIV® and then decreased to baseline 4 weeks later. In this study, the increases in blood pressure and pulse were not considered serious or associated with adverse events. However, individuals may have larger increases than reflected by the mean changes. Effects on Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) Patients taking INTUNIV® demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data. Patients taking INTUNIV® had a mean increase in weight of 0.5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period. Patients receiving INTUNIV® for at least 12 months in open-label studies gained an average of 8 kg in weight and 8 cm (3 in) in height. The height, weight, and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long-term studies compared to when they began receiving INTUNIV®. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Table 13 includes additional adverse reactions observed in short-term, placebo-controlled and long-term, open-label clinical studies not included elsewhere in section 6.1, listed by organ system. Table 13: Other adverse reactions observed in clinical studies Body System Adverse Reaction Cardiac Atrioventricular block General Asthenia, chest pain Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity Investigations Increased alanine amino transferase Nervous system Convulsion Renal Increased urinary frequency Vascular Hypertension, pallor 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of guanfacine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the post-marketing study and/or reported spontaneously, not included in section 6.1, include: General: edema, malaise, tremor Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, hypertensive encephalopathy Central Nervous System: paresthesias, vertigo Eye Disorders: blurred vision Musculo-Skeletal System: arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia Psychiatric: confusion, hallucinations Reproductive System, Male: impotence Respiratory System: dyspnea Skin and Appendages: alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash Special Senses: alterations in taste"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope: Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients at risk for hypotension, heart block, bradycardia, syncope, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease or chronic renal failure. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Avoid concomitant use of drugs with additive effects unless clinically indicated. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated (5.1). Sedation and somnolence: Occur commonly with INTUNIV ® . Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to INTUNIV ® (5.2). Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: May worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently (5.3). Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increase upon Discontinuation: Hypertensive encephalopathy has been very rarely reported upon abrupt discontinuation. To minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure upon discontinuation, the total daily dose of INTUNIV® should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days (5.4). 5.1 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Treatment with INTUNIV® can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate INTUNIV slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope. 5.2 Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Before using INTUNIV® with other centrally active depressants, consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with INTUNIV® . Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol. 5.3 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities The sympatholytic action of INTUNIV® may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate INTUNIV slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs. 5.4 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increase upon Discontinuation Blood pressure and pulse may increase following discontinuation of INTUNIV®. In postmarketing experience, hypertensive encephalopathy has been very rarely reported upon abrupt discontinuation of INTUNIV® [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. To minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure upon discontinuation, the total daily dose of INTUNIV® should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Blood pressure and pulse should be monitored when reducing the dose or discontinuing INTUNIV®."

        "Drug Interactions The potential for increased sedation when guanfacine is given with other CNS-depressant drugs should be appreciated. The administration of guanfacine concomitantly with a known microsomal enzyme inducer (phenobarbital or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration. In such cases, therefore, more frequent dosing may be required to achieve or maintain the desired hypotensive response. Further, if guanfacine is to be discontinued in such patients, careful tapering of the dosage may be necessary in order to avoid rebound phenomena (see Rebound above)."

In an open-label trial of one year’s duration, 580 hypertensive subjects were given guanfacine, titrated to achieve goal blood pressure, alone (51%), with diuretic (38%), with beta blocker (3%), with diuretic plus beta blocker (6%), or with diuretic plus vasodilator (2%). The mean daily dose of guanfacine reached was 4.7 mg. Adverse Reaction Incidence of adverse reactions at any time during the study Incidence of adverse reactions at end of one year n=580 n=580 Dry Mouth 60% 15% Drowsiness 33% 6% Dizziness 15% 1% Constipation 14% 3% Weakness 5% 1% Headache 4% 0.2% Insomnia 5% 0% There were 52 (8.9%) dropouts due to adverse effects in this 1-year trial. The causes were: dry mouth (n=20), weakness (n=12), constipation (n=7), somnolence (n=3), nausea (n=3), orthostatic hypotension (n=2), insomnia (n=1), rash (n=1), nightmares (n=1), headache (n=1), and depression (n=1). Postmarketing Experience An open-label postmarketing study involving 21,718 patients was conducted to assess the safety of guanfacine (as the hydrochloride) 1 mg/day given at bedtime for 28 days. Guanfacine was administered with or without other antihypertensive agents. Adverse events reported in the postmarketing study at an incidence greater than 1% included dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, headache, and nausea. The most commonly reported adverse events in this study were the same as those observed in controlled clinical trials. Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the postmarketing study and/or reported spontaneously include: BODY AS A WHOLE: asthenia, chest pain, edema, malaise, tremor CARDIOVASCULAR: bradycardia, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM: paresthesias, vertigo EYE DISORDERS: blurred vision GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia LIVER AND BILIARY SYSTEM: abnormal liver function tests MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM: arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia PSYCHIATRIC: agitation, anxiety, confusion, depression, insomnia, nervousness REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, MALE: impotence RESPIRATORY SYSTEM: dyspnea SKIN AND APPENDAGES: alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash SPECIAL SENSES: alterations in taste URINARY SYSTEM: nocturia, urinary frequency Rare, serious disorders with no definitive cause and effect relationship to guanfacine have been reported spontaneously and/or in the postmarketing study. These events include acute renal failure, cardiac fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, heart block, and myocardial infarction."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions noted with guanfacine are similar to those of other drugs of the central α2-adrenoreceptor agonist class: dry mouth, sedation (somnolence), weakness (asthenia), dizziness, constipation, and impotence. While the reactions are common, most are mild and tend to disappear on continued dosing. Skin rash with exfoliation has been reported in a few cases; although clear cause and effect relationships to guanfacine could not be established, should a rash occur, guanfacine should be discontinued and the patient monitored appropriately. In the dose-response monotherapy study described under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, the frequency of the most commonly observed adverse reactions showed a dose relationship from 0.5 to 3 mg as follows: Adverse Reaction Placebo n=59 0.5 mg n=60 1 mg n=61 2 mg n=60 3 mg n=59 Dry Mouth 0% 10% 10% 42% 54% Somnolence 8% 5% 10% 13% 39% Asthenia 0% 2% 3% 7% 3% Dizziness 8% 12% 2% 8% 15% Headache 8% 13% 7% 5% 3% Impotence 0% 0% 0% 7% 3% Constipation 0% 2% 0% 5% 15% Fatigue 2% 2% 5% 8% 10% The percent of patients who dropped out because of adverse reactions are shown below for each dosage group. Placebo 0.5 mg 1 mg 2 mg 3 mg Percent dropouts 0% 2.0% 5.0% 13% 32% The most common reasons for dropouts among patients who received guanfacine were dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, and constipation. In the 12-week, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of guanfacine administered with 25 mg chlorthalidone at bedtime, the frequency of the most commonly observed adverse reactions showed a clear dose relationship from 0.5 to 3 mg as follows: Adverse Reaction Placebo n=73 0.5 mg n=72 1 mg n=72 2 mg n=72 3 mg n=72 Dry Mouth 5 (7%) 4 (5%) 6 (8%) 8 (11%) 20 (28%) Somnolence 1 (1%) 3 (4%) 0 (0%) 1 (1%) 10 (14%) Asthenia 0 (0%) 2 (3%) 0 (0%) 2 (2%) 7 (10%) Dizziness 2 (2%) 1 (1%) 3 (4%) 6 (8%) 3 (4%) Headache 3 (4%) 4 (3%) 3 (4%) 1 (1%) 2 (2%) Impotence 1 (1%) 1 (0%) 0 (0%) 1 (1%) 3 (4%) Constipation 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 1 (1%) 1 (1%) Fatigue 3 (3%) 2 (3%) 2 (3%) 5 (6%) 3 (4%) There were 41 premature terminations because of adverse reactions in this study. The percent of patients who dropped out and the dose at which the dropout occurred were as follows: Dose Placebo 0.5 mg 1 mg 2 mg 3 mg Percent dropouts 6.9% 4.2% 3.2% 6.9% 8.3% Reasons for dropouts among patients who received guanfacine were: somnolence, headache, weakness, dry mouth, dizziness, impotence, insomnia, constipation, syncope, urinary incontinence, conjunctivitis, paresthesia, and dermatitis. In a second 12-week placebo-controlled combination therapy study in which the dose could be adjusted upward to 3 mg per day in 1-mg increments at 3-week intervals, i.e., a setting more similar to ordinary clinical use, the most commonly recorded reactions were: dry mouth, 47%; constipation, 16%; fatigue, 12%; somnolence, 10%; asthenia, 6%; dizziness, 6%; headache, 4%; and insomnia, 4%.
