        "Drug Interactions Dantrolene sodium is metabolized by the liver, and it is theoretically possible that its metabolism may be enhanced by drugs known to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes. However, neither phenobarbital nor diazepam appears to affect dantrolene sodium metabolism. Binding to plasma protein is not significantly altered by diazepam, diphenylhydantoin, or phenylbutazone. Binding to plasma proteins is reduced by warfarin and clofibrate and increased by tolbutamide. Cardiovascular collapse in association with marked hyperkalemia has been reported in patients receiving dantrolene in combination with calcium channel blockers. It is recommended that the combination of intravenous dantrolene sodium and calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, not be used together during the management of malignant hyperthermia crisis. Administration of dantrolene may potentiate vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block."
      "adverse_reactions": [
        "ADVERSE REACTIONS There have been occasional reports of death following malignant hyperthermia crisis even when treated with intravenous dantrolene; incidence figures are not available (the pre-dantrolene mortality of malignant hyperthermia crisis was approximately 50%). Most of these deaths can be accounted for by late recognition, delayed treatment, inadequate dosage, lack of supportive therapy, intercurrent disease and/or the development of delayed complications such as renal failure or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. In some cases there are insufficient data to completely rule out therapeutic failure of dantrolene. There are reports of fatality in malignant hyperthermia crisis, despite initial satisfactory response to i.v. dantrolene, which involve patients who could not be weaned from dantrolene after initial treatment. The administration of Revonto to human volunteers is associated with loss of grip strength and weakness in the legs, as well as drowsiness and dizziness. The following adverse reactions are in approximate order of severity: There are rare reports of pulmonary edema developing during the treatment of malignant hyperthermia crisis in which the diluent volume and mannitol needed to deliver i.v. dantrolene possibly contributed. There have been reports of thrombophlebitis following administration of intravenous dantrolene; actual incidence figures are not available. Tissue necrosis secondary to extravasation has been reported. There have been rare reports of urticaria and erythema possibly associated with the administration of i.v. dantrolene sodium. There has been one case of anaphylaxis. Injection site reactions (pain, erythema, swelling), commonly due to extravasation, have been reported. None of the serious reactions occasionally reported with long-term oral dantrolene sodium use, such as hepatitis, seizures, and pleural effusion with pericarditis, have been reasonably associated with short-term Revonto therapy. The following events have been reported in patients receiving oral dantrolene: aplastic anemia, leukopenia, lymphocytic lymphoma, and heart failure. (See package insert for dantrolene sodium capsules for a complete listing of adverse reactions.) The published literature has included some reports of dantrolene sodium use in patients with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). Revonto (dantrolene sodium for injection) is not indicated for the treatment of NMS and patients may expire despite treatment with Revonto.

While a definite drug interaction with estrogen therapy has not yet been established, caution should be observed if the two drugs are to be given concomitantly. Hepatotoxicity has occurred more often in women over 35 years of age receiving concomitant estrogen therapy. Cardiovascular collapse in patients treated simultaneously with verapamil and dantrolene sodium is rare. The combination of therapeutic doses of intravenous dantrolene sodium and verapamil in halothane/α-chloralose anesthetized swine has resulted in ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse in association with marked hyperkalemia.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently occurring side effects of dantrolene sodium have been drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, general malaise, fatigue, and diarrhea. These are generally transient, occurring early in treatment, and can often be obviated by beginning with a low dose and increasing dosage gradually until an optimal regimen is established. Diarrhea may be severe and may necessitate temporary withdrawal of dantrolene sodium therapy. If diarrhea recurs upon readministration of dantrolene sodium, therapy should probably be withdrawn permanently. Other less frequent side effects, listed according to system, are: Gastrointestinal: Constipation, rarely progressing to signs of intestinal obstruction, GI bleeding, anorexia, swallowing difficulty, gastric irritation, abdominal cramps, nausea and/or vomiting. Hepatobiliary: Hepatitis (see WARNINGS ). Neurologic: Speech disturbance, seizure, headache, light-headedness, visual disturbance, diplopia, alteration of taste, insomnia, drooling.
