        "Drug Interactions: EPZICOM: No clinically significant changes to pharmacokinetic parameters were observed for abacavir or lamivudine when administered together. Abacavir: Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions). The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir. In a study of 11 HIV-1-infected patients receiving methadone-maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of ZIAGEN twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI: 6% to 42%). This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. Lamivudine: Trimethoprim (TMP) 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole (SMX) 800 mg once daily has been shown to increase lamivudine exposure (AUC). No change in dose of either drug is recommended. The effect of higher doses of TMP/SMX on lamivudine pharmacokinetics has not been investigated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of EPZICOM in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for additional drug interactions."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Abacavir: Hypersensitivity Reaction: Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir sulfate, a component of EPZICOM. In one study, once-daily dosing of ZIAGEN was associated with more severe hypersensitivity reactions (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients). Therapy-Naive Adults: Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a >=5% frequency during therapy with ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily or ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily are listed in Table 4. Table 4. Treatment-Emergent (All Causality) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity (Grades 2-4, >=5% Frequency) in Therapy-Naive Adults (CNA30021) Through 48 Weeks of Treatment Adverse Event ZIAGEN 600 mg q.d. plus EPIVIR plus Efavirenz(n = 384) ZIAGEN 300 mg b.i.d. plus EPIVIR plus Efavirenz(n = 386) Drug hypersensitivity*  9% 7% Insomnia 7% 9% Depression/Depressed mood 7% 7% Headache/Migraine 7% 6% Fatigue/Malaise 6% 8% Dizziness/Vertigo 6% 6% Nausea 5% 6% Diarrhea* 5% 6% Rash 5% 5% Pyrexia 5% 3% Abdominal pain/gastritis 4% 5% Abnormal dreams 4% 5% Anxiety 3% 5% * Patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily, experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with patients who received ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of patients receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the patients receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily had this event.  Study CNA30024 was a multi-center, double-blind, controlled study in which 649 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either ZIAGEN (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) or zidovudine (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). CNA30024 used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded portion of the study, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 patients in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 patients in the zidovudine group. Laboratory Abnormalities: Laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical studies of ZIAGEN were anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and elevations of CPK, blood glucose, and triglycerides. Additional laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical studies of EPIVIR were thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of bilirubin, amylase, and lipase. The frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were comparable between treatment groups in Study CNA30021. Other Adverse Events: In addition to adverse reactions listed above, other adverse events observed in the expanded access program for abacavir were pancreatitis and increased GGT. Observed During Clinical Practice: The following reactions have been identified during post-approval use of abacavir and lamivudine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to abacavir and/or lamivudine. Abacavir: Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction. Skin: Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use. Abacavir and Lamivudine: Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat (see PRECAUTIONS: Fat Redistribution). Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Aplastic anemia, anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly. Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, pancreatitis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B (see WARNINGS). Hypersensitivity: Sensitization reactions (including anaphylaxis), urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Nervous: Paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures. Respiratory: Abnormal breath sounds/wheezing. Skin: Alopecia, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Zalcitabine is not recommended for use in combination with lamivudine. (7.2) 7.1 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Zalcitabine Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. 7.3 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. 7.4 Drugs with No Observed Interactions With Lamivudine A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. The most common reported adverse reactions (incidence >=15%) in adults were headache, nausea, malaise and fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea, and cough.

Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions in >=5% of patients during therapy with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR(R) 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3. Table 3. Selected Clinical Adverse Reactions (>=5% Frequency) in Four Controlled Clinical Trials (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) *Either zidovudine monotherapy or zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine.

Lamivudine 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3 to 4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical Endpoint Study (NUCB3007) * The median duration on study was 12 months.

Pediatric Patients - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Lamivudine oral solution has been studied in 638 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age in 3 clinical trials. Selected clinical adverse reactions and physical findings with a >=5% frequency during therapy with lamivudine 4 mg/kg twice daily plus RETROVIR 160 mg/m2 3 times daily in therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 5.

In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-cotaining antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERATM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Lamivudine Plus Zidovudine Administered As Separate Formulations: In 4 randomized, controlled trials of EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) 300 mg per day plus RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) 600 mg per day, the following selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were observed (see Tables 1 and 2 ). Table 1. Selected Clinical Adverse Reactions (>= 5% Frequency) in 4 Controlled Clinical Trials With EPIVIR(R) (Lamivudine) 300 mg/day and RETROVIR(R) (Zidovudine) 600 mg/day Adverse Reaction EPIVIR(R) (Lamivudine) plus RETROVIR(R) (Zidovudine) (n = 251) Body as a whole Headache 35% Malaise & fatigue 27% Fever or chills 10% Digestive Nausea 33% Diarrhea 18% Nausea & vomiting 13% Anorexia and/or decreased appetite 10% Abdominal pain 9% Abdominal cramps 6% Dyspepsia 5% Nervous system Neuropathy 12% Insomnia & other sleep disorders 11% Dizziness 10% Depressive disorders 9% Respiratory Nasal signs & symptoms 20% Cough 18% Skin Skin rashes 9% Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal pain 12% Myalgia 8% Arthralgia 5% Pancreatitis was observed in 9 of the 2,613 adult patients (0.3%) who received EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) in controlled clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine), RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine), and/or lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Cardiovascular: Cardiomyopathy. Endocrine and Metabolic: Gynecomastia, hyperglycemia. Gastrointestinal: Oral mucosal pigmentation, stomatitis. General: Vasculitis, weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia, (including pure red cell aplasia and anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly. Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, pancreatitis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3), (5.4), (5.7)]. Hypersensitivity: Sensitization reactions (including anaphylaxis), urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Nervous: Paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures. Respiratory: Abnormal breath sounds/wheezing. Skin: Alopecia, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hematologic toxicity/bone marrow suppression including neutropenia and anemia have been associated with the use of zidovudine, one of the components of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. (5.1) Symptomatic myopathy associated with prolonged use of zidovudine. (5.2) Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues including zidovudine. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. (5.3) Acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and have discontinued lamivudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.4) Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine tablets to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-Infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV(R) was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV(R) for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV(R) Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "Drug Interactions Section Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine."

        "Adverse Reactions Section The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions in >=5% of patients during therapy with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR (R) 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3. Table 3. Selected Clinical Adverse Reactions (>=5% Frequency) in Four Controlled Clinical Trials (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) Adverse Reaction Lamivudine 150 mg Twice Daily plus RETROVIR (n = 251) RETROVIR* (n = 230) Body as a Whole Headache 35% 27% Malaise & fatigue 27% 23% Fever or chills 10% 12% Digestive Nausea 33% 29% Diarrhea 18% 22% Nausea & vomiting 13% 12% Anorexia and/or decreased appetite 10% 7% Abdominal pain 9% 11% Abdominal cramps 6% 3% Dyspepsia 5% 5% Nervous System Neuropathy 12% 10% Insomnia & other sleep disorders 11% 7% Dizziness 10% 4% Depressive disorders 9% 4% Respiratory Nasal signs & symptoms 20% 11% Cough 18% 13% Skin Skin rashes 9% 6% Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal pain 12% 10% Myalgia 8% 6% Arthralgia 5% 5% *Either zidovudine monotherapy or zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine. Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis was observed in 9 out of 2,613 adult patients (0.3%) who received lamivudine in controlled clinical trials EPV20001, NUCA3001, NUCB3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3002, and NUCB3007 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Lamivudine 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3 to 4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical Endpoint Study (NUCB3007) Test (Threshold Level) 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies* Clinical Endpoint Study* Lamivudine plus RETROVIR RETROVIR Lamivudine plus Current Therapy Placebo plus Current Therapy‡ Absolute neutrophil count (<750/mm3) 7.2% 5.4% 15% 13% Hemoglobin (<8 g/dL) 2.9% 1.8% 2.2% 3.4% Platelets (<50,000/mm3) 0.4% 1.3% 2.8% 3.8% ALT (>5 x ULN) 3.7% 3.6% 3.8% 1.9% AST (>5 x ULN) 1.7% 1.8% 4% 2.1% Bilirubin (>2.5 x ULN) 0.8% 0.4% ND ND Amylase (>2 x ULN) 4.2% 1.5% 2.2% 1.1% * The median duration on study was 12 months.

The frequencies of selected laboratory abnormalities reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) were similar. Pediatric Patients - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Lamivudine oral solution has been studied in 638 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age in 3 clinical trials. Selected clinical adverse reactions and physical findings with a >=5% frequency during therapy with lamivudine 4 mg/kg twice daily plus RETROVIR 160 mg/m 2 3 times daily in therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 5.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] .

        "Warnings And Precautions Section Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-cotaining antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. Lamivudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA (R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA (R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA (R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERA TM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "Drug Interactions Section Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine."

        "Adverse Reactions Section The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions in >=5% of patients during therapy with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR (R) 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3. Table 3.

Lamivudine 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3 to 4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical Endpoint Study (NUCB3007) Test (Threshold Level) 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies* Clinical Endpoint Study* Lamivudine plus RETROVIR RETROVIR Lamivudine plus Current Therapy Placebo plus Current Therapy‡ Absolute neutrophil count (<750/mm3) 7.2% 5.4% 15% 13% Hemoglobin (<8 g/dL) 2.9% 1.8% 2.2% 3.4% Platelets (<50,000/mm3) 0.4% 1.3% 2.8% 3.8% ALT (>5 x ULN) 3.7% 3.6% 3.8% 1.9% AST (>5 x ULN) 1.7% 1.8% 4% 2.1% Bilirubin (>2.5 x ULN) 0.8% 0.4% ND ND Amylase (>2 x ULN) 4.2% 1.5% 2.2% 1.1% * The median duration on study was 12 months.

The frequencies of selected laboratory abnormalities reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) were similar. Pediatric Patients - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Lamivudine oral solution has been studied in 638 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age in 3 clinical trials. Selected clinical adverse reactions and physical findings with a >=5% frequency during therapy with lamivudine 4 mg/kg twice daily plus RETROVIR 160 mg/m 2 3 times daily in therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 5.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] . Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "Warnings And Precautions Section Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-cotaining antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. Lamivudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA (R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA (R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA (R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERA TM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests,anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly,rash,respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury,and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) - Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) - Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) - Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) - Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) - Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment- associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) - Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) - Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis:In clinical trials in non-HIV-1- infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products:Lamivudine Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR- HBV Tablets. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R)(abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R)(abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV:In non-HIV-l-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- containing products including EPIVIR-HBV Tablets,COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R)(emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERATM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-l/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV -1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretrovira1 therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Zalcitabine is not recommended for use in combination with EPIVIR. (7.2) 7.1 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Zalcitabine Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. 7.3 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. 7.4 Drugs with No Observed Interactions With EPIVIR A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between EPIVIR and zidovudine."

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and Hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of EPIVIR in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough.

Pediatric Patients - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: EPIVIR Oral Solution has been studied in 638 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age in 3 clinical trials. Selected clinical adverse reactions and physical findings with a >=5% frequency during therapy with EPIVIR 4 mg/kg twice daily plus RETROVIR 160 mg/m2 3 times daily in therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 5.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving EPIVIR alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with EPIVIR. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to EPIVIR plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label EPIVIR in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of EPIVIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued EPIVIR. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of EPIVIR appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue EPIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering EPIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EPIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and EPIVIR-HBV Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, EPIVIR Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products EPIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and EPIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of EPIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, EPIVIR should be used with caution. Treatment with EPIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EPIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving EPIVIR alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with EPIVIR. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to EPIVIR plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label EPIVIR in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of EPIVIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued EPIVIR. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of EPIVIR appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue EPIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering EPIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EPIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and EPIVIR-HBV Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, EPIVIR Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products EPIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and EPIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of EPIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, EPIVIR should be used with caution. Treatment with EPIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EPIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -COMBIVIR should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) -Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue COMBIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) -Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) -Pancreatitis: Use with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) -Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (5.8, 5.9). 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of COMBIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 grams per dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with COMBIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with COMBIVIR. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine) and RETROVIR (zidovudine). Treatment with COMBIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). 5.5 Related Products that are Not Recommended COMBIVIR is a fixed-dose combination of 2 nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine). Concomitant administration of COMBIVIR with other products containing lamivudine or zidovudine is not recommended. In addition, do not administer COMBIVIR in combination with products containing emtricitabine. 5.6 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and COMBIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine) and RETROVIR (zidovudine). Discontinuation of COMBIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and COMBIVIR is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including COMBIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: Hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Lamivudine and Zidovudine should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption maybe needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containinq Products: Lamivudine and Zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and Zidovudine is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and Zidovudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution, EPIVIR-HBV tablets and oral solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) tablets, capsules, syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERATM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Concomitant use with the following drugs should be avoided: stavudine (7.1), zalcitabine (7.1), doxorubicin (7.2). Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.3) 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Lamivudine : Zalcitabine : Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of COMBIVIR in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine : Stavudine : Concomitant use of COMBIVIR with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of COMBIVIR with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended.

EPIVIR 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving EPIVIR 300 mg once daily or EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3-4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical Endpoint Study (NUCB3007) Test (Threshold Level) 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studiesa Clinical Endpoint Studya EPIVIR plus RETROVIR RETROVIRb EPIVIR plus Current Therapy Placebo plus Current Therapyc Absolute neutrophil count (<750/mm3) 7.2% 5.4% 15% 13% Hemoglobin (<8.0 g/dL) 2.9% 1.8% 2.2% 3.4% Platelets (<50,000/mm3) 0.4% 1.3% 2.8% 3.8% ALT (>5.0 x ULN) 3.7% 3.6% 3.8% 1.9% AST (>5.0 x ULN) 1.7% 1.8% 4.0% 2.1% Bilirubin (>2.5 x ULN) 0.8% 0.4% ND ND Amylase (>2.0 x ULN) 4.2% 1.5% 2.2% 1.1% a The median duration on study was 12 months. b Either zidovudine monotherapy or zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine. c Current therapy was either zidovudine, zidovudine plus didanosine, or zidovudine plus zalcitabine.

The frequencies of selected laboratory abnormalities reported in patients receiving EPIVIR 300 mg once daily or EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) were similar. Pediatric Patients - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: EPIVIR Oral Solution has been studied in 638 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age in 3 clinical trials. Selected clinical adverse reactions and physical findings with a >=5% frequency during therapy with EPIVIR 4 mg/kg twice daily plus RETROVIR 160 mg/m2 3 times daily in therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 5.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving EPIVIR alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with EPIVIR. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to EPIVIR plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label EPIVIR in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of EPIVIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued EPIVIR. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of EPIVIR appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue EPIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering EPIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EPIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and EPIVIR-HBV Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, EPIVIR Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products EPIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and EPIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of EPIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, EPIVIR should be used with caution. Treatment with EPIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EPIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

(5.5) -Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) -Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) -Pancreatitis: Use with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) -Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (5.8, 5.9) 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 grams per dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine) and RETROVIR (zidovudine). Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With Hepatitis B Virus Co-Infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). 5.5 Related Products that are Not Recommended Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are a fixed-dose combination of 2 nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine). Concomitant administration of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with other products containing lamivudine or zidovudine is not recommended. In addition, do not administer lamivudine and zidovudine tablets in combination with products containing emtricitabine. 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine) and RETROVIR (zidovudine). Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablets is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Ad ults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions in >=5% of patients during therapy with Lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus Zidovudine 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 2. Table 2.

Lamivudine 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving Lamivudine 300 mg once daily or Lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 3. Table 3. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3-4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical Endpoint Study (NUCB3007) 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies a Clinical Endpoint Study a Test (Threshold Level) Lamivudine plus Zidovudine Zidovudineb Lamivudine plus Current Therapy Placebo plus Current TherapyC Absolute neutrophil count (less than 750/mm3) 7.2% 5.4% 15% 13% Hemoglobin (less than 8.0 g/dL) 2.9% 1.8% 2.2% 3.4% Platelets (less than 50,000/mm3) 0.4% 1.3% 2.8% 3.8% ALT (>5.0 x ULN) 3.7% 3.6% 3.8% 1.9% AST (>5.0 x ULN) 1.7% 1.8% 4.0% 2.1% Bilirubin (>2.5 x ULN) 0.8% 0.4% ND ND Amylase (>2.0 x ULN) 4.2% 1.5% 2.2% 1.1% a The median duration on study was 12 months. b Either zidovudine monotherapy or zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine. c Current therapy was either zidovudine, zidovudine plus didanosine, or zidovudine plus zalcitabine.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to Lamivudine plus Zidovudine. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label Lamivudine in combination with Zidovudine and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (less than 1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 5. Table 5.

Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5) Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine- containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The casual relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine Oral Solution contains a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than in EPIVIR-HBV Oral Solution. EPIVIRHBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response(see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine Oral Solution should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R)-HBV Tablets, EPIVIR(R) Oral Solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g.Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Zalcitabine is not recommended for use in combination with lamivudine tablets. (7.2) 7.1 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Zalcitabine Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. 7.3 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. 7.4 Drugs with No Observed Interactions With Lamivudine A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine."

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1 Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic Hyperglycemia. General Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine tablets. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine tablets appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine tablets to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, Lamivudine Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine tablets should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERA(TM) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "Drug Interactions Section Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. A drug interaction study showedno clinically significant interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine."

        "Adverse Reactions Section The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: - Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. - Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. - Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-l and Hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. - Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-l-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions of in >=5% of patients during therapy with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus zidovudine 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3. Table 3.

Lamivudine 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4.Frequencies of Selected Grade 3 to 4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical End point Study (NUCB3007) Test (Threshold Level) 24-Week Surogate Endpoint Studiesa Clinical Endpoint Studya Lamivudine plus Zidovudine Zidovudineb Lamivudine plus Current Therapy Placebo plus Current Therapyc Absolute neutrophil count (<750/mm3) 7.2% 5.4% 15% 13% Hemoglobin (<8.0 g/dL) 2.9% 1.8% 2.2% 3.4% Platelets (<50,000/mm3) 0.4% 1.3% 2.8% 3.8% ALT (>5.0 x ULN) 3.7% 3.6% 3.8% 1.9% AST (>5.0 x ULN) 1.7% 1.8% 4.0% 2.1% Bilirubin (>2.5 x ULN) 0.8% 0.4% ND ND Amylase (>2.0 x ULN) 4.2% 1.5% 2.2% 1.1% a The median duration on study was 12 months. b Either zidovudine monotherapy or zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine. c Current therapy was either zidovudine, zidovudine plus didonasine, or zidovudine plus zalcitabine ULN = Upper limit of normal.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to lamivudine plus zidovudine. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open- label lamivudine in combination with zidovudine and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests,anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly,rash,respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury,and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1,5.2)].

        "Warnings And Precautions Section - Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) - Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) - Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) - Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) - Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) - Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment- associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) - Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) - Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis:In clinical trials in non-HIV-1- infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products:Lamivudine Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR- HBV Tablets. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R)(abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R)(abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV:In non-HIV-l-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. Lamivudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- containing products including EPIVIR-HBV Tablets,COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R)(emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERATM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-l/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV -1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretrovira1 therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -EPIVIR-HBV should not be used with other medications that contain lamivudine or with medications that contain emtricitabine. (5.4) -Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions: Monitor ALT and HBV DNA levels during lamivudine treatment to aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants or loss of therapeutic response is suspected. (2.6, 5.5) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including EPIVIR-HBV and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Most of these reports have described patients receiving nucleoside analogues for treatment of HIV infection, but there have been reports of lactic acidosis in patients receiving lamivudine for hepatitis B. Particular caution should be exercised when administering EPIVIR-HBV to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EPIVIR-HBV should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Exacerbation of Hepatitis After Discontinuation of Treatment Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of EPIVIR-HBV (these have been primarily detected by serum ALT elevations, in addition to the re-emergence of HBV DNA commonly observed after stopping treatment; see Table 4 for more information regarding frequency of posttreatment ALT elevations) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. The causal relationship of hepatitis exacerbation after discontinuation of EPIVIR-HBV has not been clearly established. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with EPIVIR-HBV. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of EPIVIR-HBV alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. 5.3 Risk of HIV-1 Resistance if EPIVIR-HBV Is Used in Patients With Unrecognized or Untreated HIV-1 Infection EPIVIR-HBV tablets and oral solution contain a lower lamivudine dose than the lamivudine dose in the following drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection: -EPIVIR(R) tablets and oral solution, -COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, -EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, and -TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not approved for patients co-infected with HBV and HIV. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to such patients, the higher dosage indicated for HIV therapy should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen, and the prescribing information for EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, EPZICOM, or TRIZIVIR as well as for EPIVIR-HBV should be consulted. HIV counseling and testing should be offered to all patients before beginning EPIVIR-HBV and periodically during treatment because of the risk of rapid emergence of resistant HIV and limitation of treatment options if EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed to treat chronic hepatitis B in a patient who has unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection or acquires HIV-1 infection during treatment. 5.4 Coadministration With Other Medications Containing Lamivudine or Emtricitabine Do not coadminister EPIVIR-HBV with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR (lamivudine), COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine), EPZICOM (abacavir/lamivudine), or TRIZIVIR (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister EPIVIR-HBV with emtricitabine-containing products including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), STRIBILD(R) (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 5.5 Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions In controlled clinical trials, YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in subjects with on-EPIVIR-HBV re-appearance of HBV DNA after an initial decline below the solution-hybridization assay limit [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Subjects treated with EPIVIR-HBV (adults and children) with YMDD-mutant HBV at 52 weeks showed diminished treatment responses in comparison with subjects treated with EPIVIR-HBV without evidence of YMDD substitutions, including the following: lower rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBeAg loss (no greater than placebo recipients), more frequent return of positive HBV DNA, and more frequent ALT elevations. In the controlled trials, when subjects developed YMDD-mutant HBV, they had a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from their own previous on-treatment levels. Progression of hepatitis B, including death, has been reported in some subjects with YMDD-mutant HBV, including subjects from the liver transplant setting and from other clinical trials. In clinical practice, monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA levels during treatment with EPIVIR-HBV may aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants is suspected."

        "Drug Interactions Section Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine."

        "Adverse Reactions Section The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions in >=5% of patients during therapy with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR (R) 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3. Table 3.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis was observed in 9 out of 2,613 adult patients (0.3%) who received lamivudine in controlled clinical trials EPV20001, NUCA3001, NUCB3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3002, and NUCB3007 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Lamivudine 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3 to 4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical Endpoint Study (NUCB3007) Test (Threshold Level) 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies* Clinical Endpoint Study* Lamivudine plus RETROVIR RETROVIR Lamivudine plus Current Therapy Placebo plus Current Therapy‡ Absolute neutrophil count (<750/mm3) 7.2% 5.4% 15% 13% Hemoglobin (<8 g/dL) 2.9% 1.8% 2.2% 3.4% Platelets (<50,000/mm3) 0.4% 1.3% 2.8% 3.8% ALT (>5 x ULN) 3.7% 3.6% 3.8% 1.9% AST (>5 x ULN) 1.7% 1.8% 4% 2.1% Bilirubin (>2.5 x ULN) 0.8% 0.4% ND ND Amylase (>2 x ULN) 4.2% 1.5% 2.2% 1.1% * The median duration on study was 12 months.

The frequencies of selected laboratory abnormalities reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) were similar. Pediatric Patients - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Lamivudine oral solution has been studied in 638 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age in 3 clinical trials. Selected clinical adverse reactions and physical findings with a >=5% frequency during therapy with lamivudine 4 mg/kg twice daily plus RETROVIR 160 mg/m 2 3 times daily in therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 5.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] . Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "Warnings And Precautions Section Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-cotaining antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. Lamivudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA (R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA (R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA (R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERA TM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

(7.3) -Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.4) -Methadone: An increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. (7.6) 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of zidovudine with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of zidovudine with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Ethanol Abacavir: Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.5 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Methadone Abacavir: The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir. In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of ZIAGEN twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. 7.7 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP."

Other Adverse Events: In addition to adverse reactions in Tables 1 and 2, other adverse events observed in the expanded access program for abacavir were pancreatitis and increased GGT. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of abacavir, lamivudine, and/or zidovudine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to abacavir, lamivudine and/or zidovudine. Abacavir: Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction. Skin: Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use. Abacavir, Lamivudine, and/or Zidovudine: Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Cardiovascular: Cardiomyopathy. Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Gynecomastia, hyperglycemia. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia and/or decreased appetite, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, oral mucosal pigmentation. General: Vasculitis, weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Aplastic anemia, anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia.

        "-See boxed warning for information about the following: hypersensitivity reactions, hematologic toxicity, myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5) -Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Discontinue TRIZIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) -Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) -Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.7) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.8) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. -TRIZIVIR should not be administered with other products containing abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine; or with emtricitabine. (5.11) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reaction Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with TRIZIVIR and other abacavir-containing products. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at high risk for experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Prior to initiating therapy with abacavir, screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele is recommended; this approach has been found to decrease the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. For HLA-B*5701-positive patients, treatment with an abacavir-containing regimen is not recommended and should be considered only with close medical supervision and under exceptional circumstances when the potential benefit outweighs the risk. HLA-B*5701-negative patients may develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir; however, this occurs significantly less frequently than in HLA-B*5701-positive patients. Regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, permanently discontinue TRIZIVIR if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible. Important information on signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, as well as clinical management, is presented below. Signs and Symptoms of Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity to abacavir is a multi-organ clinical syndrome usually characterized by a sign or symptom in 2 or more of the following groups. Group 1: Fever Group 2: Rash Group 3: Gastrointestinal (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain) Group 4: Constitutional (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness) Group 5: Respiratory (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis) Hypersensitivity to abacavir following the presentation of a single sign or symptom has been reported infrequently. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 8% of 2,670 subjects (n = 206) in 9 clinical trials (range: 2% to 9%) with enrollment from November 1999 to February 2002. Data on time to onset and symptoms of suspected hypersensitivity were collected on a detailed data collection module. The frequencies of symptoms are shown in Figure 1. Symptoms usually appeared within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir, although the reaction may occur at any time during therapy. Median time to onset was 9 days; 89% appeared within the first 6 weeks; 95% of subjects reported symptoms from 2 or more of the 5 groups listed above. A trial with ZIAGEN(R) (abacavir sulfate) used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded portion of the trial, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 subjects in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 subjects in the zidovudine group. Figure 1. Hypersensitivity-Related Symptoms Reported With >=10% Frequency in Clinical Trials (n = 206 Subjects) Other less common signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity include lethargy, myolysis, edema, abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which can be localized), and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death have occurred in association with hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir in some subjects include lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and rash. The rash usually appears maculopapular or urticarial, but may be variable in appearance. There have been reports of erythema multiforme. Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred without rash. Laboratory abnormalities associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir in some subjects include elevated liver function tests, elevated creatinine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia. Clinical Management of Hypersensitivity: Discontinue TRIZIVIR as soon as a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. To minimize the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, permanently discontinue TRIZIVIR if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications). Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, NEVER restart TRIZIVIR or any other abacavir-containing product because more severe symptoms can occur within hours and may include life-threatening hypotension and death. When therapy with TRIZIVIR has been discontinued for reasons other than symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction, and if reinitiation of abacavir is under consideration, carefully evaluate the reason for discontinuation to ensure that the patient did not have symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If the patient is of unknown HLA-B*5701 status, screening for the allele is recommended prior to reinitiation of TRIZIVIR. If hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, DO NOT reintroduce TRIZIVIR or any other abacavir-containing product. Even in the absence of the HLA-B*5701 allele, it is important to permanently discontinue abacavir and not rechallenge with abacavir if a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction. If symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity are not identified, reintroduction can be undertaken with continued monitoring for symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. Make patients aware that a hypersensitivity reaction can occur with reintroduction of abacavir and that abacavir reintroduction needs to be undertaken only if medical care can be readily accessed by the patient or others. Risk Factor: HLA-B*5701 Allele: Trials have shown that carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele is associated with a significantly increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. CNA106030 (PREDICT-1), a randomized, double-blind trial, evaluated the clinical utility of prospective HLA-B*5701 screening on the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction in abacavir-naive HIV-1-infected adults (n = 1,650). In this trial, use of pre-therapy screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele and exclusion of subjects with this allele reduced the incidence of clinically suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions from 7.8% (66/847) to 3.4% (27/803). Based on this trial, it is estimated that 61% of patients with the HLA-B*5701 allele will develop a clinically suspected hypersensitivity reaction during the course of abacavir treatment compared with 4% of patients who do not have the HLA-B*5701 allele. Screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele is recommended prior to initiating treatment with abacavir. Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. For HLA-B*5701-positive patients, initiating or reinitiating treatment with an abacavir-containing regimen is not recommended and should be considered only with close medical supervision and under exceptional circumstances where potential benefit outweighs the risk. Skin patch testing is used as a research tool and should not be used to aid in the clinical diagnosis of abacavir hypersensitivity. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision-making. Even in the absence of the HLA-B*5701 allele, it is important to permanently discontinue abacavir and not rechallenge with abacavir if a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction. Figure 1. 5.2 Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of TRIZIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. TRIZIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with TRIZIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.3 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with TRIZIVIR. 5.4 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including abacavir, lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering TRIZIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with TRIZIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.5 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected subjects treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether reinitiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. In non-HIV-infected subjects treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV(R) [lamivudine] for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and TRIZIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of TRIZIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and TRIZIVIR is not advised. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TRIZIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.9 Myocardial Infarction In a published prospective, observational, epidemiological trial designed to investigate the rate of myocardial infarction in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy, the use of abacavir within the previous 6 months was correlated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI).1 In a sponsor-conducted pooled analysis of clinical trials, no excess risk of myocardial infarction was observed in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. In totality, the available data from the observational cohort and from clinical trials are inconclusive. As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking). 5.10 Therapy Experienced Patients In clinical trials, subjects with prolonged prior nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) exposure or who had HIV-1 isolates that contained multiple mutations conferring resistance to NRTIs had limited response to abacavir. The potential for cross-resistance between abacavir and other NRTIs should be considered when choosing new therapeutic regimens in therapy-experienced patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. 5.11 Use With Other Abacavir-, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products TRIZIVIR is a fixed-dose combination of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine and is intended only for patients whose regimen would otherwise include these 3 components. TRIZIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other abacavir-, lamivudine-, or zidovudine-containing products including ZIAGEN (abacavir sulfate) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine and zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) Tablets, EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine) Capsules and Oral Solution, TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) Tablets, or COMPLERA(R) (emtricitabine/rilpirivine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) Tablets. The complete prescribing information for all agents being considered for use with TRIZIVIR should be consulted before combination therapy with TRIZIVIR is initiated."

The safety profile of lamivudine tablets in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected subjects in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea, and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects during therapy with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR(R) 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3.

Lamivudine Tablets 300 mg Once Daily The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving lamivudine tablets 300 mg once daily or lamivudine tablets 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4.

Pancreatitis Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric subjects receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation trial (NUCA2002), 14 subjects (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these subjects died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label trial (NUCA2005), 12 subjects (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Trial ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 subjects randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 subject in this trial who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, 6 subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and 2 subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Additional pediatric use information for patients aged 3 months and above is approved for ViiV Healthcare Company's EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution. However, due to ViiV Healthcare Company's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Neonates Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Endocrine and Metabolic Hyperglycemia. General Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin Alopecia, pruritus."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine-containing products should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (5.6, 5.7). 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine tablets to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Important Differences among Lamivudine-containing Products Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, EPIVIR oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Related Products that are Not Recommended Lamivudine tablets are one of multiple lamivudine-containing products. Concomitant administration of lamivudine tablets with other products containing lamivudine is not recommended. Concomitant use of lamivudine tablets with emtricitabine-containing products is also not recommended. 5.4 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6). See the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) - Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) - Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) - Pancreatitis: Use with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) - Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (5.8, 5.9) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablet, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 grams per dL [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) and RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine). Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Post-treatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine). Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine). 5.5 Related Products that are Not Recommended Lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is a fixed-dose combination of 2 nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine). Concomitant administration of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with other products containing lamivudine or zidovudine is not recommended. In addition, do not administer lamivudine and zidovudine tablets in combination with products containing emtricitabine. 5.6 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) and RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine). Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablets is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablet should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). TMP 160 mg/SMX 800 mg once daily has been shown to increase lamivudine exposure (AUC) by 44% (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine.

Lamivudine in Patients With HIV: In HIV-infected patients, safety information reflects a higher dose of lamivudine (150 mg b.i.d.) than the dose used to treat chronic hepatitis B in HIV-negative patients. In clinical trials using lamivudine as part of a combination regimen for treatment of HIV infection, several clinical adverse events occurred more often in lamivudine-containing treatment arms than in comparator arms. These included nasal signs and symptoms (20% vs. 11%), dizziness (10% vs. 4%), and depressive disorders (9% vs. 4%). Pancreatitis was observed in 9 of the 2,613 adult patients (<0.5%) who received EPIVIR in controlled clinical trials. Laboratory abnormalities reported more often in lamivudine-containing arms included neutropenia and elevations of liver function tests (also more frequent in lamivudine-containing arms for a retrospective analysis of HIV/HBV dually infected patients in one study), and amylase elevations. Please see the complete prescribing information for EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution for more information. Pediatric Patients With Hepatitis B: Pediatric Patients With HIV Infection: In early open-label studies of lamivudine in children with HIV, peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia were reported, and pancreatitis was observed in 14% to 15% of patients. Observed During Clinical Practice: The following events have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, potential causal connection to lamivudine, or a combination of these factors. Post-marketing experience with lamivudine at this time is largely limited to use in HIV-infected patients. Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly.

(5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Zidovudine, a component of COMBIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with COMBIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with COMBIVIR. Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering COMBIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: COMBIVIR Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. COMBIVIR is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. COMBIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and COMBIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of COMBIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including COMBIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted using COMBIVIR Tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use with the following drugs should be avoided: stavudine (7.1), zalcitabine (7.1), doxorubicin (7.2). Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.3) 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Lamivudine: Zalcitabine: Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of COMBIVIR in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of COMBIVIR with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of COMBIVIR with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3. 5.4) COMBIVIR should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue COMBIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of COMBIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with COMBIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with COMBIVIR. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering COMBIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: COMBIVIR Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products COMBIVIR is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. COMBIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA(TM) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and COMBIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of COMBIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including COMBIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

In an open-label dose-escalation trial (NUCA2002), 14 subjects (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these subjects died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label trial (NUCA2005), 12 subjects (18%) developed pancreatitis. In trial ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 subjects randomized to lamivudine plus zidovudine. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 subject in this trial who received open- label lamivudine in combination with zidovudine and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, 6 subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and 2 subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6. Table 6. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3 to 4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Pediatric subjects in Trial ACTG300 Test (Threshold Level) Lamivudine plus Zidovudine Didanosine Absoluteneutrophilcount (<400/mm3) Hemoglobin (<7 g/dL) Platelets (<50,000/mm3) ALT (>10 x ULN) AST (>10 x ULN) Lipase (>2.5 x ULN) Total Amylase (>2.5 x ULN) 8% 4% 1% 1% 2% 3% 3% 3% 2% 3% 3% 4% 3% 3% ULN = Upper limit of normal. Additional pediatric use information for patients aged 3 months and above is approved for ViiV Healthcare Company's EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution. However, due to ViiV Healthcare Company's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Neonates Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic Hyperglycemia. General Weakness Hemic and Lymphatic Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin Alopecia, pruritus."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) - Emtricitabine-containing products should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) - Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment- associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) - Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) - Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine.These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Important Differences among Lamivudine-containing ProductsLamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR- HBV Tablets. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Related Products that are Not Recommended Lamivudine is one of multiple lamivudine-containing products. Concomitant administration of lamivudine with other products containing lamivudine is not recommended. Concomitant use of lamivudine with emtricitabine-containing products is also not recommended. 5.4 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-l/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV -1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretrovira1 therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted using lamivudine and zidovudine tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use with the following drugs should be avoided: stavudine (7.1), zalcitabine (7.1), doxorubicin. (7.2) Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.3) 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Lamivudine: Zalcitabine: Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablet in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablet with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablet with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Lamivudine and Zidovudine should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablet as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablet, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine and Zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablet is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablet should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including lamivudine tablets and oral solution, EPIVIR-HBV tablets and oral solution, zidovudine tablets, capsules, syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenifovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablet should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine tablet should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Lamivudine and zidovudine should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) -Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) -Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) -Pancreatitis: Use with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) -Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (5.8, 5.9) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 grams per dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. See full prescribing information for lamivudine and zidovudine. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. See full prescribing information for lamivudine. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for lamivudine. 5.5 Related Products that are Not Recommended Lamivudine and zidovudine is a fixed-dose combination of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine). Concomitant administration of lamivudine and zidovudine with other products containing lamivudine or zidovudine is not recommended. In addition, do not administer lamivudine and zidovudine in combination with products containing emtricitabine. 5.6 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. See full prescribing information for lamivudine and zidovudine. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and zidovudine should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain- Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Exacerbation of hepatitis B after discontinuation of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Risk of emergence of resistant HIV-1 infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Risk of emergence of resistant HIV-1 infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The most common reported adverse reactions in those receiving Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) (incidence greater than or equal to 10% and reported at a rate greater than placebo) were ear, nose and throat infections, sore throat, and diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials of Adults With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection: Clinical adverse reactions (regardless of investigator's causality assessment) reported in greater or equal to 10% of subjects who received lamivudine and reported at a rate greater than placebo are listed in Table 2.

Posttreatment transaminase elevations were observed in some subjects followed after cessation of lamivudine. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Blood and Lympatic System Disorders: Thrombocytopenia. Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Blood and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) should not be used with other medications that contain lamivudine or with medications that contain emtricitabine. (5.4) Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions: Monitor ALT and HBV DNA levels during lamivudine treatment to aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants or loss of therapeutic response is suspected. (2.6, 5.5) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Most of these reports have described patients receiving nucleoside analogues for treatment of HIV infection, but there have been reports of lactic acidosis in patients receiving lamivudine for hepatitis B. Particular caution should be exercised when administering Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Exacerbation of Hepatitis After Discontinuation of Treatment Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) (these have been primarily detected by serum ALT elevations, in addition to the re-emergence of HBV DNA commonly observed after stopping treatment; see Table 4 for more information regarding frequency of posttreatment ALT elevations) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. The causal relationship of hepatitis exacerbation after discontinuation of lamivudine has not been clearly established. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with Lamivudine Tablets (HBV). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. 5.3 Risk of HIV-1 Resistance if Lamivudine Is Used in Patients With Unrecognized or Untreated HIV-1 Infection Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) contain a lower lamivudine dose than the lamivudine dose in the following drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection: EPIVIR(R) tablets and oral solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, and TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) are not approved for patients co-infected with HBV and HIV. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to such patients, the higher dosage indicated for HIV therapy should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen, and the prescribing information for EPIVIR(R), COMBIVIR(R), EPZICOM(R), or TRIZIVIR(R), as well as for Lamivudine Tablets (HBV), should be consulted. HIV counseling and testing should be offered to all patients before beginning Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) and periodically during treatment because of the risk of rapid emergence of resistant HIV and limitation of treatment options if Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) is prescribed to treat chronic hepatitis B in a patient who has unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection or acquires HIV-1 infection during treatment. 5.4 Coadministration With Other Medications Containing Lamivudine or Emtricitabine Do not coadminister Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine), COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine), EPZICOM(R) (abacavir/lamivudine), or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) with emtricitabine-containing products including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), STRIBILD(R) (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 5.5 Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions In controlled clinical trials, YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in subjects with on-lamivudine re-appearance of HBV DNA after an initial decline below the solution-hybridization assay limit [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Subjects treated with lamivudine (adults and children) with YMDD-mutant HBV at 52 weeks showed diminished treatment responses in comparison with subjects treated with lamivudine without evidence of YMDD substitutions, including the following: lower rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBeAg loss (no greater than placebo recipients), more frequent return of positive HBV DNA, and more frequent ALT elevations. In the controlled trials, when subjects developed YMDD-mutant HBV, they had a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from their own previous on-treatment levels. Progression of hepatitis B, including death, has been reported in some subjects with YMDD-mutant HBV, including subjects from the liver transplant setting and from other clinical trials. In clinical practice, monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA levels during treatment with Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) may aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants is suspected."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3. 5.4) COMBIVIR should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue COMBIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Zidovudine, a component of COMBIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with COMBIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with COMBIVIR. Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering COMBIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: COMBIVIR Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. COMBIVIR is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. COMBIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution; EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution; RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion; EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets; or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and COMBIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of COMBIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including COMBIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Zalcitabine is not recommended for use in combination with Lamivudine. (7.2) 7.1 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Zalcitabine Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. 7.3 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. 7.4 Drugs with No Observed Interactions With Lamivudine A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. The most common reported adverse reactions (incidence >=15%) in adults were headache, nausea, malaise and fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea, and cough. (6.1) The most common reported adverse reactions (incidence >=15%) in pediatric patients were fever and cough.

Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions in >=5% of patients during therapy with Lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus Zidovudine 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 2. Table 2.

Lamivudine 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving Lamivudine 300 mg once daily or Lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 3. Table 3. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3-4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical Endpoint Study (NUCB3007) 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies a Clinical Endpoint Study a Test (Threshold Level) Lamivudine plus Zidovudine Zidovudineb Lamivudine plus Current Therapy Placebo plus Current TherapyC Absolute neutrophil count (less than 750/mm3) 7.2% 5.4% 15% 13% Hemoglobin (less than 8.0 g/dL) 2.9% 1.8% 2.2% 3.4% Platelets (less than 50,000/mm3) 0.4% 1.3% 2.8% 3.8% ALT (>5.0 x ULN) 3.7% 3.6% 3.8% 1.9% AST (>5.0 x ULN) 1.7% 1.8% 4.0% 2.1% Bilirubin (>2.5 x ULN) 0.8% 0.4% ND ND Amylase (>2.0 x ULN) 4.2% 1.5% 2.2% 1.1% a The median duration on study was 12 months. b Either zidovudine monotherapy or zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine. c Current therapy was either zidovudine, zidovudine plus didanosine, or zidovudine plus zalcitabine.

The frequencies of selected laboratory abnormalities reported in patients receiving Lamivudine 300 mg once daily or Lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) were similar. Pediatric Patients - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Lamivudine Oral Solution has been studied in 638 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age in 3 clinical trials. Selected clinical adverse reactions and physical findings with a >=5% frequency during therapy with Lamivudine 4 mg/kg twice daily plus Zidovudine 160 mg/m2 3 times daily in therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 4.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to Lamivudine plus Zidovudine. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label Lamivudine in combination with Zidovudine and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (less than 1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 5. Table 5.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine Oral Solution contains a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than in EPIVIR-HBV Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response(see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine Oral Solution should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R)-HBV Tablets, EPIVIR(R) Oral Solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g.Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Concomitant use with the following drugs should be avoided: stavudine (7.1), zalcitabine (7.1), doxorubicin (7.2). Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.3) 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Lamivudine: Zalcitabine: Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine tablets to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-Infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA(TM) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hematologic toxicity/bone marrow suppression including neutropenia and anemia have been associated with the use of zidovudine, one of the components of COMBIVIR. (5.1) Symptomatic myopathy associated with prolonged use of zidovudine. (5.2) Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues including zidovudine. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. (5.3) Acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and have discontinued lamivudine, a component of COMBIVIR. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.4) COMBIVIR should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue COMBIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Zidovudine, a component of COMBIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with COMBIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with COMBIVIR. Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering COMBIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis.

Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including COMBIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir sulfate, a component of EPZICOM. In one study, once-daily dosing of ZIAGEN was associated with more severe hypersensitivity reactions (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients). Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a >=5% frequency during therapy with ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily or ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily are listed in Table 4. Table 4. Treatment-Emergent (All Causality) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity (Grades 2-4, >=5% Frequency) in Therapy-Naive Adults (CNA30021) Through 48 Weeks of Treatment Adverse Event ZIAGEN 600 mg q.d. plus EPIVIR plus Efavirenz(n = 384) ZIAGEN 300 mg b.i.d. plus EPIVIR plus Efavirenz(n = 386) Drug hypersensitivity*  9% 7% Insomnia 7% 9% Depression/Depressed mood 7% 7% Headache/Migraine 7% 6% Fatigue/Malaise 6% 8% Dizziness/Vertigo 6% 6% Nausea 5% 6% Diarrhea* 5% 6% Rash 5% 5% Pyrexia 5% 3% Abdominal pain/gastritis 4% 5% Abnormal dreams 4% 5% Anxiety 3% 5% * Patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily, experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with patients who received ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of patients receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the patients receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily had this event.  Study CNA30024 was a multi-center, double-blind, controlled study in which 649 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either ZIAGEN (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) or zidovudine (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). CNA30024 used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded portion of the study, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 patients in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 patients in the zidovudine group. Laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical studies of ZIAGEN were anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and elevations of CPK, blood glucose, and triglycerides. Additional laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical studies of EPIVIR were thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of bilirubin, amylase, and lipase. The frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were comparable between treatment groups in Study CNA30021. In addition to adverse reactions listed above, other adverse events observed in the expanded access program for abacavir were pancreatitis and increased GGT. The following reactions have been identified during post-approval use of abacavir and lamivudine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to abacavir and/or lamivudine. Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction. Skin: Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat (see PRECAUTIONS: Fat Redistribution). Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Aplastic anemia, anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly. Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, pancreatitis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B (see WARNINGS).

Exacerbation of hepatitis B after discontinuation of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Risk of emergence of resistant HIV-1 infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Risk of emergence of resistant HBV infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. - The most common reported adverse reactions in those receiving lamivudine tablets (HBV) (incidence greater than or equal to 10% and reported at a rate greater than placebo) were ear, nose and throat infections, sore throat, and diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trialsof Adults With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection:Clinical adverse reactions (regardless of investigator's causality assessment) reported in greater or equal to 10% of subjects who received lamivudine tablets (HBV) and reported at a rate greater than placebo are listed in Table 2.

Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trialsof Pediatric Subjects With ChronicHepatitis B Virus Infection:Most commonly observed adverse reactions in the pediatric trials were similar to those in adult trials. Posttreatment transaminase elevations were observed in some subjects followed after cessation of lamivudine tablets (HBV). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine tablets (HBV). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lamivudine tablets (HBV)should not be used with other medications that contain lamivudine or with medications that contain emtricitabine. (5.4) Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions: Monitor ALT and HBV DNA levels during lamivudine treatment to aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants or loss of therapeutic response is suspected. (2.6, 5.5) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine tablets (HBV) and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Most of these reports have described patients receiving nucleoside analogues for treatment of HIV infection, but there have been reports of lactic acidosis in patients receiving lamivudine for hepatitis B. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine tablets (HBV) to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine tablets (HBV) should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Exacerbation of Hepatitis After Discontinuation of Treatment Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine tablets (HBV) (these have been primarily detected by serum ALT elevations, in addition to the re-emergence of HBV DNA commonly observed after stopping treatment; see Table 4 for more information regarding frequency of posttreatment ALT elevations) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. The causal relationship of hepatitis exacerbation after discontinuation of lamivudine tablets (HBV) has not been clearly established. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with lamivudine tablets (HBV). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine tablets (HBV) alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. 5.3 Risk of HIV-1 Resistance if Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) Is Used in Patients With Unrecognized or Untreated HIV-1 Infection Lamivudine tablets (HBV) contain a lower lamivudine dose than the lamivudine dose in the following drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection: - EPIVIR(R) tablets and oral solution, - COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, - EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, and - TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in lamivudine tablets (HBV) are not approved for patients co-infected with HBV and HIV. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to such patients, the higher dosage indicated for HIV therapy should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen, and the prescribing information for EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, EPZICOM, or TRIZIVIR, as well as for lamivudine tablets (HBV), should be consulted. HIV counseling and testing should be offered to all patients before beginning lamivudine tablets (HBV) and periodically during treatment because of the risk of rapid emergence of resistant HIV and limitation of treatment options if lamivudine tablets (HBV) is prescribed to treat chronic hepatitis B in a patient who has unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection or acquires HIV-1 infection during treatment. 5.4 Coadministration With Other Medications Containing Lamivudine or Emtricitabine Do not coadminister lamivudine tablets (HBV) with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR (lamivudine), COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine), EPZICOM (abacavir/lamivudine), or TRIZIVIR (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister lamivudine tablets (HBV) with emtricitabine-containing products including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), STRIBILD(R) (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 5.5 Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions In controlled clinical trials, YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in subjects with on- lamivudine tablets (HBV) re-appearance of HBV DNA after an initial decline below the solution-hybridization assay limit [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Subjects treated with lamivudine tablets (HBV) (adults and children) with YMDD-mutant HBV at 52 weeks showed diminished treatment responses in comparison with subjects treated with lamivudine tablets (HBV) without evidence of YMDD substitutions, including the following: lower rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBeAg loss (no greater than placebo recipients), more frequent return of positive HBV DNA, and more frequent ALT elevations. In the controlled trials, when subjects developed YMDD-mutant HBV, they had a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from their own previous on-treatment levels. Progression of hepatitis B, including death, has been reported in some subjects with YMDD-mutant HBV, including subjects from the liver transplant setting and from other clinical trials. In clinical practice, monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA levels during treatment with lamivudine tablets (HBV) may aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants is suspected."

(7.3) No drug interaction studies have been conducted using lamivudine and zidovudine tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Lamivudine: Zalcitabine: Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients with HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Post-treatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use with Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA(TM) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.6 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was co-administered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin & lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION No drug interaction studies have been conducted using lamivudine and zidovudine tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Lamivudine: Zalcitabine: Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine and zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP."

Acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Exacerbation of anemia in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Lamivudine Plus Zidovudine Administered As Separate Formulations: In 4 randomized, controlled trials of EPIVIR 300 mg per day plus RETROVIR 600 mg per day, the following selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were observed (see Tables 1 and 2). Pancreatitis was observed in 9 of the 2,613 adult patients (0.3%) who received EPIVIR in controlled clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are listed in Table 2. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following reactions have been identified during post-approval use of EPIVIR, RETROVIR, and/or lamivudine and zidovudine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to EPIVIR, RETROVIR, and/or lamivudine and zidovudine. Body as a Whole:Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Cardiovascular:Cardiomyopathy. Endocrine and Metabolic:Gynecomastia, hyperglycemia. Gastrointestinal:Oral mucosal pigmentation, stomatitis. General:Vasculitis, weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic:Anemia, (including pure red cell aplasia and anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS SECTION 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm 3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption maybe needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containinq Products: Lamivudine and Zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV (R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and Zidovudine is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and Zidovudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR (R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution, EPIVIR-HBV tablets and oral solution, RETROVIR (R) (zidovudine) tablets, capsules, syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM (R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA (R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA (R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA (R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA TM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

The safety profile of EPIVIR in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected subjects in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea, and cough.

In an open-label dose-escalation trial (NUCA2002), 14 subjects (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with EPIVIR. Three of these subjects died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label trial (NUCA2005), 12 subjects (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Trial ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 subjects randomized to EPIVIR plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 subject in this trial who received open-label EPIVIR in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, 6 subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and 2 subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Pediatric Subjects Once-daily versus Twice-daily Dosing (COL105677) The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of EPIVIR was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator. Neonates Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation . Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of EPIVIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. ( ) - 5.2 Emtricitabine-containing products should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. ( ) - 5.3 Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue EPIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. ( ) - 5.4 Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. ( ) - 5.5 Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. ( , ) - 5.6 5.7 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Caution should be exercised when administering EPIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EPIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. - Important Differences among Lamivudine containing Products EPIVIR tablets and oral solution contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, EPIVIR tablets, EPIVIR oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV . Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus 5.3 Related Products that are Not Recommended EPIVIR is one of multiple lamivudine-containing products. Concomitant administration of EPIVIR with other products containing lamivudine is not recommended. Concomitant use of EPIVIR with emtricitabine-containing products is also not recommended. 5.4 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients , hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and EPIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of EPIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6). See the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, EPIVIR should be used with caution. Treatment with EPIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EPIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as infection, cytomegalovirus, pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Mycobacterium avium Pneumocystis jirovecii Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "Drug Interactions Section Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. A drug interaction study showedno clinically significant interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine."

        "Adverse Reactions Section The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: - Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. - Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. - Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-l and Hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. - Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-l-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions of in >=5% of patients during therapy with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus zidovudine 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3. Table 3.

Lamivudine 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4.Frequencies of Selected Grade 3 to 4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical End point Study (NUCB3007) Test (Threshold Level) 24-Week Surogate Endpoint Studiesa Clinical Endpoint Studya Lamivudine plus Zidovudine Zidovudineb Lamivudine plus Current Therapy Placebo plus Current Therapyc Absolute neutrophil count (<750/mm3) 7.2% 5.4% 15% 13% Hemoglobin (<8.0 g/dL) 2.9% 1.8% 2.2% 3.4% Platelets (<50,000/mm3) 0.4% 1.3% 2.8% 3.8% ALT (>5.0 x ULN) 3.7% 3.6% 3.8% 1.9% AST (>5.0 x ULN) 1.7% 1.8% 4.0% 2.1% Bilirubin (>2.5 x ULN) 0.8% 0.4% ND ND Amylase (>2.0 x ULN) 4.2% 1.5% 2.2% 1.1% a The median duration on study was 12 months. b Either zidovudine monotherapy or zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine. c Current therapy was either zidovudine, zidovudine plus didonasine, or zidovudine plus zalcitabine ULN = Upper limit of normal.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to lamivudine plus zidovudine. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open- label lamivudine in combination with zidovudine and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests,anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly,rash,respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury,and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1,5.2)]. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus"

        "Warnings And Precautions Section - Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) - Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) - Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) - Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) - Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) - Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment- associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) - Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) - Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis:In clinical trials in non-HIV-1- infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products:Lamivudine Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR- HBV Tablets. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R)(abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R)(abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV:In non-HIV-l-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. Lamivudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- containing products including EPIVIR-HBV Tablets,COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R)(emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERATM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-l/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV -1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretrovira1 therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "-EPIVIR-HBV should not be used with other medications that contain lamivudine or with medications that contain emtricitabine. (5.4) -Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions: Monitor ALT and HBV DNA levels during lamivudine treatment to aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants or loss of therapeutic response is suspected. (2.6, 5.5) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including EPIVIR-HBV and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Most of these reports have described patients receiving nucleoside analogues for treatment of HIV infection, but there have been reports of lactic acidosis in patients receiving lamivudine for hepatitis B. Particular caution should be exercised when administering EPIVIR-HBV to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EPIVIR-HBV should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Exacerbation of Hepatitis After Discontinuation of Treatment Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of EPIVIR-HBV (these have been primarily detected by serum ALT elevations, in addition to the re-emergence of HBV DNA commonly observed after stopping treatment; see Table 4 for more information regarding frequency of posttreatment ALT elevations) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. The causal relationship of hepatitis exacerbation after discontinuation of EPIVIR-HBV has not been clearly established. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with EPIVIR-HBV. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of EPIVIR-HBV alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. 5.3 Risk of HIV-1 Resistance if EPIVIR-HBV Is Used in Patients With Unrecognized or Untreated HIV-1 Infection EPIVIR-HBV tablets and oral solution contain a lower lamivudine dose than the lamivudine dose in the following drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection: -EPIVIR(R) tablets and oral solution, -COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, -EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, and -TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not approved for patients co-infected with HBV and HIV. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to such patients, the higher dosage indicated for HIV therapy should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen, and the prescribing information for EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, EPZICOM, or TRIZIVIR as well as for EPIVIR-HBV should be consulted. HIV counseling and testing should be offered to all patients before beginning EPIVIR-HBV and periodically during treatment because of the risk of rapid emergence of resistant HIV and limitation of treatment options if EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed to treat chronic hepatitis B in a patient who has unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection or acquires HIV-1 infection during treatment. 5.4 Coadministration With Other Medications Containing Lamivudine or Emtricitabine Do not coadminister EPIVIR-HBV with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR (lamivudine), COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine), EPZICOM (abacavir/lamivudine), or TRIZIVIR (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister EPIVIR-HBV with emtricitabine-containing products including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), STRIBILD(R) (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 5.5 Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions In controlled clinical trials, YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in subjects with on-EPIVIR-HBV re-appearance of HBV DNA after an initial decline below the solution-hybridization assay limit [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Subjects treated with EPIVIR-HBV (adults and children) with YMDD-mutant HBV at 52 weeks showed diminished treatment responses in comparison with subjects treated with EPIVIR-HBV without evidence of YMDD substitutions, including the following: lower rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBeAg loss (no greater than placebo recipients), more frequent return of positive HBV DNA, and more frequent ALT elevations. In the controlled trials, when subjects developed YMDD-mutant HBV, they had a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from their own previous on-treatment levels. Progression of hepatitis B, including death, has been reported in some subjects with YMDD-mutant HBV, including subjects from the liver transplant setting and from other clinical trials. In clinical practice, monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA levels during treatment with EPIVIR-HBV may aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants is suspected."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction trials have been conducted using COMBIVIR Tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lamivudine : Zalcitabine : Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of COMBIVIR in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine : Stavudine : Concomitant use of COMBIVIR with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. Zidovudine: Concomitant use of COMBIVIR with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP."

        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3. 5.4) COMBIVIR should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue COMBIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Zidovudine, a component of COMBIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with COMBIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with COMBIVIR. Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering COMBIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: COMBIVIR Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. COMBIVIR is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. COMBIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution; EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution; RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion; EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets; or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and COMBIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of COMBIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including COMBIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS EPZICOM: No clinically significant changes to pharmacokinetic parameters were observed for abacavir or lamivudine when administered together. Abacavir: Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions). The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir. In a study of 11 HIV-1-infected patients receiving methadone-maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of ZIAGEN twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI: 6% to 42%). This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. Lamivudine: Trimethoprim (TMP) 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole (SMX) 800 mg once daily has been shown to increase lamivudine exposure (AUC). No change in dose of either drug is recommended. The effect of higher doses of TMP/SMX on lamivudine pharmacokinetics has not been investigated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of EPZICOM in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended.

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Abacavir: Hypersensitivity Reaction: Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir sulfate, a component of EPZICOM. In one study, once-daily dosing of ZIAGEN was associated with more severe hypersensitivity reactions (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients). Therapy-Naive Adults: Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with afrequency during therapy with ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily or ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily are listed in Table 4.

Five percent (5%) of patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of patients receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the patients receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily had this event.Study CNA30024 was a multi-center, double-blind, controlled study in which 649 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either ZIAGEN (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) or zidovudine (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). CNA30024 used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded portion of the study, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 patients in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 patients in the zidovudine group. Laboratory Abnormalities: Laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical studies of ZIAGEN were anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and elevations of CPK, blood glucose, and triglycerides. Additional laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical studies of EPIVIR were thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of bilirubin, amylase, and lipase. The frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were comparable between treatment groups in Study CNA30021. Other Adverse Events: In addition to adverse reactions listed above, other adverse events observed in the expanded access program for abacavir were pancreatitis and increased GGT. Observed During Clinical Practice: The following reactions have been identified during post-approval use of abacavir and lamivudine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to abacavir and/or lamivudine. Abacavir: Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction. Skin: Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use. Abacavir and Lamivudine: Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat (see PRECAUTIONS: Fat Redistribution). Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Aplastic anemia, anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly. Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, pancreatitis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B (see WARNINGS).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) should not be used with other medications that contain lamivudine or with medications that contain emtricitabine. (5.4) Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions: Monitor ALT and HBV DNA levels during lamivudine treatment to aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants or loss of therapeutic response is suspected. (2.6, 5.5) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Most of these reports have described patients receiving nucleoside analogues for treatment of HIV infection, but there have been reports of lactic acidosis in patients receiving lamivudine for hepatitis B. Particular caution should be exercised when administering Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Exacerbation of Hepatitis After Discontinuation of Treatment Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) (these have been primarily detected by serum ALT elevations, in addition to the re-emergence of HBV DNA commonly observed after stopping treatment; see Table 4 for more information regarding frequency of posttreatment ALT elevations) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. The causal relationship of hepatitis exacerbation after discontinuation of lamivudine has not been clearly established. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with Lamivudine Tablets (HBV). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. 5.3 Risk of HIV-1 Resistance if Lamivudine Is Used in Patients With Unrecognized or Untreated HIV-1 Infection Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) contain a lower lamivudine dose than the lamivudine dose in the following drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection: EPIVIR(R) tablets and oral solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, and TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) are not approved for patients co-infected with HBV and HIV. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to such patients, the higher dosage indicated for HIV therapy should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen, and the prescribing information for EPIVIR(R), COMBIVIR(R), EPZICOM(R), or TRIZIVIR(R), as well as for Lamivudine Tablets (HBV), should be consulted. HIV counseling and testing should be offered to all patients before beginning Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) and periodically during treatment because of the risk of rapid emergence of resistant HIV and limitation of treatment options if Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) is prescribed to treat chronic hepatitis B in a patient who has unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection or acquires HIV-1 infection during treatment. 5.4 Coadministration With Other Medications Containing Lamivudine or Emtricitabine Do not coadminister Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine), COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine), EPZICOM(R) (abacavir/lamivudine), or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) with emtricitabine-containing products including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), STRIBILD(R) (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 5.5 Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions In controlled clinical trials, YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in subjects with on-lamivudine re-appearance of HBV DNA after an initial decline below the solution-hybridization assay limit [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Subjects treated with lamivudine (adults and children) with YMDD-mutant HBV at 52 weeks showed diminished treatment responses in comparison with subjects treated with lamivudine without evidence of YMDD substitutions, including the following: lower rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBeAg loss (no greater than placebo recipients), more frequent return of positive HBV DNA, and more frequent ALT elevations. In the controlled trials, when subjects developed YMDD-mutant HBV, they had a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from their own previous on-treatment levels. Progression of hepatitis B, including death, has been reported in some subjects with YMDD-mutant HBV, including subjects from the liver transplant setting and from other clinical trials. In clinical practice, monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA levels during treatment with Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) may aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants is suspected."

The safety profile of EPIVIR in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected subjects in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea, and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects during therapy with EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR(R) 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3.

EPIVIR 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving EPIVIR 300 mg once daily or EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4.

Pancreatitis Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric subjects receiving EPIVIR alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation trial (NUCA2002), 14 subjects (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with EPIVIR. Three of these subjects died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label trial (NUCA2005), 12 subjects (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Trial ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 subjects randomized to EPIVIR plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 subject in this trial who received open-label EPIVIR in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, 6 subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and 2 subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Pediatric Subjects Once-daily versus Twice-daily Dosing (COL105677) The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of EPIVIR was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator. Neonates Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of EPIVIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic Hyperglycemia. General Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin Alopecia, pruritus."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) -Emtricitabine-containing products should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) -Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue EPIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) -Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) -Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (5.6, 5.7 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Caution should be exercised when administering EPIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EPIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Important Differences among Lamivudine-containing Products EPIVIR tablets and oral solution contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, EPIVIR tablets, EPIVIR oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Related Products that are Not Recommended EPIVIR is one of multiple lamivudine-containing products. Concomitant administration of EPIVIR with other products containing lamivudine is not recommended. Concomitant use of EPIVIR with emtricitabine-containing products is also not recommended. 5.4 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and EPIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of EPIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6). See the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, EPIVIR should be used with caution. Treatment with EPIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EPIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Frequencies of Selected Grade 3-4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Pediatric Patients in Study ACTG300 Test (Threshold Level) EPIVIR plus RETROVIR Didanosine Absolute neutrophil count (<400/mm3) 8% 3% Hemoglobin (<7.0 g/dL) 4% 2% Platelets (<50,000/mm3) 1% 3% ALT (>10 x ULN) 1% 3% AST (>10 x ULN) 2% 4% Lipase (>2.5 x ULN) 3% 3% Total Amylase (>2.5 x ULN) 3% 3% ULN = Upper limit of normal. Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of EPIVIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued EPIVIR. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of EPIVIR appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue EPIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering EPIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EPIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and EPIVIR-HBV Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, EPIVIR Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products EPIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and EPIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of EPIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, EPIVIR should be used with caution. Treatment with EPIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EPIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted using lamivudine and zidovudine tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use with the following drugs should be avoided: Stavudine (7.1), zalcitabine (7.1), doxorubicin. (7.2) Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.3) 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Lamivudine: Zalcitabine: Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine and zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: Hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Lamivudine and Zidovudine should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption maybe needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containinq Products: Lamivudine and Zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and Zidovudine is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and Zidovudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution, EPIVIR-HBV tablets and oral solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) tablets, capsules, syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERATM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). TMP 160 mg/SMX 800 mg once daily has been shown to increase lamivudine exposure (AUC) by 44% (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine.

In clinical trials using lamivudine as part of a combination regimen for treatment of HIV infection, several clinical adverse events occurred more often in lamivudine-containing treatment arms than in comparator arms. These included nasal signs and symptoms (20% vs. 11%), dizziness (10% vs. 4%), and depressive disorders (9% vs. 4%). Pancreatitis was observed in 9 of the 2,613 adult patients (<0.5%) who received EPIVIR in controlled clinical trials. Laboratory abnormalities reported more often in lamivudine-containing arms included neutropenia and elevations of liver function tests (also more frequent in lamivudine-containing arms for a retrospective analysis of HIV/HBV dually infected patients in one study), and amylase elevations. Please see the complete prescribing information for EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution for more information. Pediatric Patients With Hepatitis B: Pediatric Patients With HIV Infection: In early open-label studies of lamivudine in children with HIV, peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia were reported, and pancreatitis was observed in 14% to 15% of patients. Observed During Clinical Practice: The following events have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, potential causal connection to lamivudine, or a combination of these factors. Post-marketing experience with lamivudine at this time is largely limited to use in HIV-infected patients. Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly. Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and steatosis, pancreatitis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis. Nervous: Paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy. Respiratory: Abnormal breath sounds/wheezing. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus, rash."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted using lamivudine and zidovudine tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use with the following drugs should be avoided: stavudine (7.1), zalcitabine (7.1), doxorubicin (7.2). Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.3) 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Lamivudine: Zalcitabine: Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine tablets to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-Infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA(TM) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials of Pediatric Subjects With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection: Most commonly observed adverse reactions in the pediatric trials were similar to those in adult trials. Posttreatment transaminase elevations were observed in some subjects followed after cessation of lamivudine (HBV). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine (HBV). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Lamivudine tablets (HBV) should not be used with other medications that contain lamivudine or with medications that contain emtricitabine. (5.4) -Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions: Monitor ALT and HBV DNA levels during lamivudine treatment to aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants or loss of therapeutic response is suspected. (2.6, 5.5) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including Lamivudine tablets (HBV) and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Most of these reports have described patients receiving nucleoside analogues for treatment of HIV infection, but there have been reports of lactic acidosis in patients receiving lamivudine for hepatitis B. Particular caution should be exercised when administering Lamivudine tablets (HBV) to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with Lamivudine tablets (HBV) should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Exacerbation of Hepatitis After Discontinuation of Treatment Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of Lamivudine tablets (HBV) (these have been primarily detected by serum ALT elevations, in addition to the re-emergence of HBV DNA commonly observed after stopping treatment; see Table 4 for more information regarding frequency of posttreatment ALT elevations) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. The causal relationship of hepatitis exacerbation after discontinuation of Lamivudine tablets (HBV) has not been clearly established. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with Lamivudine tablets (HBV). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of Lamivudine tablets (HBV) alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. 5.3 Risk of HIV-1 Resistance if Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) Are Used in Patients With Unrecognized or Untreated HIV-1 Infection Lamivudine tablets (HBV) contain a lower lamivudine dose than the lamivudine dose in the following drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection: -EPIVIR(R) tablets and oral solution, -COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, -EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, and -TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in Lamivudine tablets (HBV) are not approved for patients co-infected with HBV and HIV. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to such patients, the higher dosage indicated for HIV therapy should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen, and the prescribing information for EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, EPZICOM, or TRIZIVIR, as well as for Lamivudine tablets (HBV) and EPIVIR-HBV(R), should be consulted. HIV counseling and testing should be offered to all patients before beginning Lamivudine tablets (HBV) and periodically during treatment because of the risk of rapid emergence of resistant HIV and limitation of treatment options if Lamivudine tablets (HBV) are prescribed to treat chronic hepatitis B in a patient who has unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection or acquires HIV-1 infection during treatment. 5.4 Coadministration With Other Medications Containing Lamivudine or Emtricitabine Do not coadminister Lamivudine tablets (HBV) with other lamivudine-containing products including the oral solution formulation of lamivudine (EPIVIR-HBV), EPIVIR (lamivudine), COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine), EPZICOM (abacavir/lamivudine), or TRIZIVIR (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister Lamivudine tablets (HBV) with emtricitabine-containing products including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), STRIBILD(R) (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 5.5 Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions In controlled clinical trials, YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in subjects with on-lamivudine (HBV) re-appearance of HBV DNA after an initial decline below the solution-hybridization assay limit [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Subjects treated with lamivudine (HBV) (adults and children) with YMDD-mutant HBV at 52 weeks showed diminished treatment responses in comparison with subjects treated with lamivudine (HBV) without evidence of YMDD substitutions, including the following: lower rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBeAg loss (no greater than placebo recipients), more frequent return of positive HBV DNA, and more frequent ALT elevations. In the controlled trials, when subjects developed YMDD-mutant HBV, they had a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from their own previous on-treatment levels. Progression of hepatitis B, including death, has been reported in some subjects with YMDD-mutant HBV, including subjects from the liver transplant setting and from other clinical trials. In clinical practice, monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA levels during treatment with Lamivudine tablets (HBV) may aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants is suspected."

In 4 randomized, controlled trials of EPIVIR 300 mg per day plus RETROVIR 600 mg per day, the following selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were observed (see Tables 1 and 2). Pancreatitis was observed in 9 of the 2,613 adult patients (0.3%) who received EPIVIR in controlled clinical trials Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are listed in Table 2.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: Hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. , , , (5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4) Lamivudine and Zidovudine should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (5.8) (5.9) 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption maybe needed. 3 [see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.1) 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Lamivudine and Zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containinq Products: (R) Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and Zidovudine is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and Zidovudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution, EPIVIR-HBV tablets and oral solution, RETROVIR (zidovudine) tablets, capsules, syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA (emtricitabine), TRUVADA (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). (R) (R) (R) (R) (R) (R) (R) TM 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. In vitro [see ], Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.1) 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as infection, cytomegalovirus, pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Mycobacterium avium Pneumocystis jirovecii disorders 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

In an open-label dose-escalation trial (NUCA2002), 14 subjects (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these subjects died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label trial (NUCA2005), 12 subjects (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Trial ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 subjects randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in one subject in this trial who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, six subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and two subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

However, due to ViiV Healthcare Company's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Neonates Limited short-term safety information is available from two small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; three neonates died (one from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, one from traumatic injury, and one from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including one with convulsions; one infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) -Emtricitabine-containing products should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) -Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) -Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) -Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Important Differences among Lamivudine-containing Products Lamivudine tablets and oral solution contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Related Products that are Not Recommended Lamivudine tablets are one of multiple lamivudine-containing products. Concomitant administration of lamivudine tablets with other products containing lamivudine is not recommended. Concomitant use of lamivudine tablets with emtricitabine-containing products is also not recommended. 5.4 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6). See the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "Drug Interactions Section Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine."

        "Adverse Reactions Section The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions in >=5% of patients during therapy with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR (R) 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3. Table 3. Selected Clinical Adverse Reactions (>=5% Frequency) in Four Controlled Clinical Trials (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) Adverse Reaction Lamivudine 150 mg Twice Daily plus RETROVIR (n = 251) RETROVIR* (n = 230) Body as a Whole Headache 35% 27% Malaise & fatigue 27% 23% Fever or chills 10% 12% Digestive Nausea 33% 29% Diarrhea 18% 22% Nausea & vomiting 13% 12% Anorexia and/or decreased appetite 10% 7% Abdominal pain 9% 11% Abdominal cramps 6% 3% Dyspepsia 5% 5% Nervous System Neuropathy 12% 10% Insomnia & other sleep disorders 11% 7% Dizziness 10% 4% Depressive disorders 9% 4% Respiratory Nasal signs & symptoms 20% 11% Cough 18% 13% Skin Skin rashes 9% 6% Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal pain 12% 10% Myalgia 8% 6% Arthralgia 5% 5% *Either zidovudine monotherapy or zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine. Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis was observed in 9 out of 2,613 adult patients (0.3%) who received lamivudine in controlled clinical trials EPV20001, NUCA3001, NUCB3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3002, and NUCB3007 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Lamivudine 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3 to 4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical Endpoint Study (NUCB3007) Test (Threshold Level) 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies* Clinical Endpoint Study* Lamivudine plus RETROVIR RETROVIR Lamivudine plus Current Therapy Placebo plus Current Therapy‡ Absolute neutrophil count (<750/mm3) 7.2% 5.4% 15% 13% Hemoglobin (<8 g/dL) 2.9% 1.8% 2.2% 3.4% Platelets (<50,000/mm3) 0.4% 1.3% 2.8% 3.8% ALT (>5 x ULN) 3.7% 3.6% 3.8% 1.9% AST (>5 x ULN) 1.7% 1.8% 4% 2.1% Bilirubin (>2.5 x ULN) 0.8% 0.4% ND ND Amylase (>2 x ULN) 4.2% 1.5% 2.2% 1.1% * The median duration on study was 12 months.

The frequencies of selected laboratory abnormalities reported in patients receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) were similar. Pediatric Patients - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Lamivudine oral solution has been studied in 638 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age in 3 clinical trials. Selected clinical adverse reactions and physical findings with a >=5% frequency during therapy with lamivudine 4 mg/kg twice daily plus RETROVIR 160 mg/m 2 3 times daily in therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 5.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] . Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "Warnings And Precautions Section Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-cotaining antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. Lamivudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA (R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA (R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA (R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir), or COMPLERA TM (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of COMBIVIR with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of COMBIVIR with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended.

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow SuppressionZidovudine, a component of COMBIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with COMBIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 MyopathyMyopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with COMBIVIR. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With SteatosisLactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering COMBIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: COMBIVIR Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing ProductsCOMBIVIR is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. COMBIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based RegimensIn vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and COMBIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of COMBIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Childs Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution SyndromeImmune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including COMBIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.9 Fat RedistributionRedistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Zalcitabine is not recommended for use in combination with lamivudine. (7.2) 7.1 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Zalcitabine Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. 7.3 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. 7.4 Drugs with No Observed Interactions With Lamivudine A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between lamivudine and zidovudine."

Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions of in >=5% of patients during therapy with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR (R) 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3. Table 3.

In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] . Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued lamivudine. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of lamivudine appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory followup for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-cotaining antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV tablets, lamivudine oral solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(TM) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA (R)(emtricitabine), or TRUVADA (R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Childs Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

In clinical trials using lamivudine as part of a combination regimen for treatment of HIV infection, several clinical adverse events occurred more often in lamivudine-containing treatment arms than in comparator arms. These included nasal signs and symptoms (20% vs. 11%), dizziness (10% vs. 4%), and depressive disorders (9% vs. 4%). Pancreatitis was observed in 9 of the 2,613 adult patients (<0.5%) who received EPIVIR in controlled clinical trials. Laboratory abnormalities reported more often in lamivudine-containing arms included neutropenia and elevations of liver function tests (also more frequent in lamivudine-containing arms for a retrospective analysis of HIV/HBV dually infected patients in one study), and amylase elevations. Please see the complete prescribing information for EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution for more information. Pediatric Patients With Hepatitis B: Pediatric Patients With HIV Infection: In early open-label studies of lamivudine in children with HIV, peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia were reported, and pancreatitis was observed in 14% to 15% of patients. Observed During Clinical Practice: The following events have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, potential causal connection to lamivudine, or a combination of these factors. Post-marketing experience with lamivudine at this time is largely limited to use in HIV-infected patients. Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly.

In an open-label dose-escalation trial (NUCA2002), 14 subjects (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these subjects died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label trial (NUCA2005), 12 subjects (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Trial ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 subjects randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 subject in this trial who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, 6 subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and 2 subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

However, due to ViiV Healthcare Company's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Neonates Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic Hyperglycemia. General Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin Alopecia, pruritus."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine-containing products should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (5.6, 5.7). 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Important Differences among Lamivudine-containing Products Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Related Products that are Not Recommended Lamivudine is one of multiple lamivudine-containing products. Concomitant administration of lamivudine with other products containing lamivudine is not recommended. Concomitant use of lamivudine with emtricitabine-containing products is also not recommended. 5.4 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6). See the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.3) No drug interaction studies have been conducted using lamivudine and zidovudine tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Lamivudine: Zalcitabine: Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients with HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Post-treatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use with Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA(TM) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.6 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was co-administered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin & lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trialsof Pediatric Subjects With ChronicHepatitis B Virus Infection:Most commonly observed adverse reactions in the pediatric trials were similar to those in adult trials. Posttreatment transaminase elevations were observed in some subjects followed after cessation of lamivudine tablets (HBV). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of lamivudine tablets (HBV). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Blood and Lympatic System Disorders: Thrombocytopenia. Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Blood and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly. Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis [see Boxed Warning], pancreatitis. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Cramps, rhabdomyolysis. Nervous: Paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy. Respiratory: Abnormal breath sounds/wheezing. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus, rash."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lamivudine tablets (HBV)should not be used with other medications that contain lamivudine or with medications that contain emtricitabine. (5.4) Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions: Monitor ALT and HBV DNA levels during lamivudine treatment to aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants or loss of therapeutic response is suspected. (2.6, 5.5) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine tablets (HBV) and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Most of these reports have described patients receiving nucleoside analogues for treatment of HIV infection, but there have been reports of lactic acidosis in patients receiving lamivudine for hepatitis B. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine tablets (HBV) to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine tablets (HBV) should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Exacerbation of Hepatitis After Discontinuation of Treatment Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine tablets (HBV) (these have been primarily detected by serum ALT elevations, in addition to the re-emergence of HBV DNA commonly observed after stopping treatment; see Table 4 for more information regarding frequency of posttreatment ALT elevations) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. The causal relationship of hepatitis exacerbation after discontinuation of lamivudine tablets (HBV) has not been clearly established. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with lamivudine tablets (HBV). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine tablets (HBV) alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. 5.3 Risk of HIV-1 Resistance if Lamivudine Tablets (HBV) Is Used in Patients With Unrecognized or Untreated HIV-1 Infection Lamivudine tablets (HBV) contain a lower lamivudine dose than the lamivudine dose in the following drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection: - EPIVIR(R) tablets and oral solution, - COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, - EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, and - TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in lamivudine tablets (HBV) are not approved for patients co-infected with HBV and HIV. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to such patients, the higher dosage indicated for HIV therapy should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen, and the prescribing information for EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, EPZICOM, or TRIZIVIR, as well as for lamivudine tablets (HBV), should be consulted. HIV counseling and testing should be offered to all patients before beginning lamivudine tablets (HBV) and periodically during treatment because of the risk of rapid emergence of resistant HIV and limitation of treatment options if lamivudine tablets (HBV) is prescribed to treat chronic hepatitis B in a patient who has unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection or acquires HIV-1 infection during treatment. 5.4 Coadministration With Other Medications Containing Lamivudine or Emtricitabine Do not coadminister lamivudine tablets (HBV) with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR (lamivudine), COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine), EPZICOM (abacavir/lamivudine), or TRIZIVIR (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister lamivudine tablets (HBV) with emtricitabine-containing products including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), STRIBILD(R) (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 5.5 Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions In controlled clinical trials, YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in subjects with on- lamivudine tablets (HBV) re-appearance of HBV DNA after an initial decline below the solution-hybridization assay limit [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Subjects treated with lamivudine tablets (HBV) (adults and children) with YMDD-mutant HBV at 52 weeks showed diminished treatment responses in comparison with subjects treated with lamivudine tablets (HBV) without evidence of YMDD substitutions, including the following: lower rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBeAg loss (no greater than placebo recipients), more frequent return of positive HBV DNA, and more frequent ALT elevations. In the controlled trials, when subjects developed YMDD-mutant HBV, they had a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from their own previous on-treatment levels. Progression of hepatitis B, including death, has been reported in some subjects with YMDD-mutant HBV, including subjects from the liver transplant setting and from other clinical trials. In clinical practice, monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA levels during treatment with lamivudine tablets (HBV) may aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants is suspected."

      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hematologic toxicity/bone marrow suppression including neutropenia and anemia have been associated with the use of zidovudine, one of the components of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. (5.1) Symptomatic myopathy associated with prolonged use of zidovudine. (5.2) Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues including zidovudine. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. (5.3) Acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and have discontinued lamivudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.4) Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine tablets to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-Infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV(R) was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV(R) for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV(R) Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hematologic toxicity/bone marrow suppression including neutropenia and anemia have been associated with the use of zidovudine, one of the components of COMBIVIR. (5.1) Symptomatic myopathy associated with prolonged use of zidovudine. (5.2) Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues including zidovudine. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity occur. (5.3) Acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and have discontinued lamivudine, a component of COMBIVIR. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.4) COMBIVIR should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue COMBIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of COMBIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with COMBIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with COMBIVIR. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering COMBIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: COMBIVIR Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products COMBIVIR is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. COMBIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and COMBIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of COMBIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Childs Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including COMBIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS COMBIVIR should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. ( ) - 5.5 Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue COMBIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. ( ) - 5.6 Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. ( ) - 5.6 Pancreatitis: Use with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. ( ) - 5.7 Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy ( , ). - 5.8 5.9 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of COMBIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm or hemoglobin less than 9.5 grams per dL . 3 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with COMBIVIR. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with COMBIVIR. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine) and RETROVIR (zidovudine). 5.4 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). 5.5 Related Products that are Not Recommended In addition, do not administer COMBIVIR in combination with products containing emtricitabine. COMBIVIR is a fixed-dose combination of 2 nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (lamivudine and zidovudine). Concomitant administration of COMBIVIR with other products containing lamivudine or zidovudine is not recommended. 5.6 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and COMBIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of COMBIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine) and RETROVIR (zidovudine). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and COMBIVIR is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis COMBIVIR should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with COMBIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including COMBIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as infection, cytomegalovirus, pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Mycobacterium avium Pneumocystis jirovecii Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. ( 5.2) - Emtricitabine-containing products should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. ( 5.3) - Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment- associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. ( 5.4) - Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. ( 5.5) - Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. ( 5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine.These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR- HBV Tablets. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine- regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine.These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Important Differences among Lamivudine-containing Products Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR- HBV Tablets. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine- containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Related Products that are Not Recommended Lamivudine is one of multiple lamivudine-containing products. Concomitant administration of lamivudine with other products containing lamivudine is not recommended. Concomitant use of lamivudine with emtricitabine-containing products is also not recommended. 5.4 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-l/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV -1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretrovira1 therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Abacavir: Hypersensitivity Reaction: Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir sulfate, a component of EPZICOM. In one study, once-daily dosing of ZIAGEN was associated with more severe hypersensitivity reactions (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients). Therapy-Naive Adults: Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a >=5% frequency during therapy with ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily or ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily are listed in Table 4. Table 4. Treatment-Emergent (All Causality) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity (Grades 2-4, >=5% Frequency) in Therapy-Naive Adults (CNA30021) Through 48 Weeks of Treatment Adverse Event ZIAGEN 600 mg q.d. plus EPIVIR plus Efavirenz (n = 384) ZIAGEN 300 mg b.i.d. plus EPIVIR plus Efavirenz (n = 386) Drug hypersensitivity*  9% 7% Insomnia 7% 9% Depression/Depressed mood 7% 7% Headache/Migraine 7% 6% Fatigue/Malaise 6% 8% Dizziness/Vertigo 6% 6% Nausea 5% 6% Diarrhea* 5% 6% Rash 5% 5% Pyrexia 5% 3% Abdominal pain/gastritis 4% 5% Abnormal dreams 4% 5% Anxiety 3% 5% * Patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily, experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with patients who received ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of patients receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of patients receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the patients receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily had this event.  Study CNA30024 was a multi-center, double-blind, controlled study in which 649 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either ZIAGEN (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily) or zidovudine (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). CNA30024 used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded portion of the study, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 patients in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 patients in the zidovudine group. Laboratory Abnormalities: Laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical studies of ZIAGEN were anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and elevations of CPK, blood glucose, and triglycerides. Additional laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical studies of EPIVIR were thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of bilirubin, amylase, and lipase. The frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were comparable between treatment groups in Study CNA30021. Other Adverse Events: In addition to adverse reactions listed above, other adverse events observed in the expanded access program for abacavir were pancreatitis and increased GGT. Observed During Clinical Practice: The following reactions have been identified during post-approval use of abacavir and lamivudine. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to abacavir and/or lamivudine. Abacavir: Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction. Skin: Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use. Abacavir and Lamivudine: Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat (see PRECAUTIONS: Fat Redistribution). Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Aplastic anemia, anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly. Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, pancreatitis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B (see WARNINGS). Hypersensitivity: Sensitization reactions (including anaphylaxis), urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Nervous: Paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures. Respiratory: Abnormal breath sounds/wheezing. Skin: Alopecia, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Lamivudine tablets should not be used with other medications that contain lamivudine or with medications that contain emtricitabine. (5.4) -Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions: Monitor ALT and HBV DNA levels during lamivudine treatment to aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants or loss of therapeutic response is suspected. (2.6, 5.5) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine tablets and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Most of these reports have described patients receiving nucleoside analogues for treatment of HIV infection, but there have been reports of lactic acidosis in patients receiving lamivudine for hepatitis B. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine tablets to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Exacerbation of Hepatitis After Discontinuation of Treatment Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine tablets (these have been primarily detected by serum ALT elevations, in addition to the re-emergence of HBV DNA commonly observed after stopping treatment; see Table 4 for more information regarding frequency of posttreatment ALT elevations) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. The causal relationship of hepatitis exacerbation after discontinuation of lamivudine tablets has not been clearly established. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with lamivudine tablets. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine tablets alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. 5.3 Risk of HIV-1 Resistance if Lamivudine Tablets Are Used in Patients With Unrecognized or Untreated HIV-1 Infection Lamivudine tablets contain a lower lamivudine dose than the lamivudine dose in the following drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection: -EPIVIR(R) tablets and oral solution, -COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) tablets, -EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, and -TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in lamivudine tablets are not approved for patients co-infected with HBV and HIV. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to such patients, the higher dosage indicated for HIV therapy should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen, and the prescribing information for EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, EPZICOM, or TRIZIVIR, as well as for lamivudine tablets, should be consulted. HIV counseling and testing should be offered to all patients before beginning lamivudine tablets and periodically during treatment because of the risk of rapid emergence of resistant HIV and limitation of treatment options if lamivudine tablets are prescribed to treat chronic hepatitis B in a patient who has unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection or acquires HIV-1 infection during treatment. 5.4 Coadministration With Other Medications Containing Lamivudine or Emtricitabine Do not coadminister lamivudine tablets with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR (lamivudine), COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine), EPZICOM (abacavir/lamivudine), or TRIZIVIR (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine). Do not coadminister lamivudine tablets with emtricitabine-containing products including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), STRIBILD(R) (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 5.5 Emergence of Resistance-Associated HBV Substitutions In controlled clinical trials, YMDD-mutant HBV was detected in subjects with on-lamivudine tablets re-appearance of HBV DNA after an initial decline below the solution-hybridization assay limit [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Subjects treated with lamivudine tablets (adults and children) with YMDD-mutant HBV at 52 weeks showed diminished treatment responses in comparison with subjects treated with lamivudine tablets without evidence of YMDD substitutions, including the following: lower rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBeAg loss (no greater than placebo recipients), more frequent return of positive HBV DNA, and more frequent ALT elevations. In the controlled trials, when subjects developed YMDD-mutant HBV, they had a rise in HBV DNA and ALT from their own previous on-treatment levels. Progression of hepatitis B, including death, has been reported in some subjects with YMDD-mutant HBV, including subjects from the liver transplant setting and from other clinical trials. In clinical practice, monitoring of ALT and HBV DNA levels during treatment with lamivudine tablets may aid in treatment decisions if emergence of viral mutants is suspected."

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine, zidovudine, and/or lamivudine and zidovudine tablet.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - See boxed warning for information about the following: hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3. 5.4) - Lamivudine and Zidovudine should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) - Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablet as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both.(5.6) - Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co- administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) - Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) - Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/ accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablet, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablet is a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and Zidovudine Tablet should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including lamivudine tablets and oral solution, EPIVIR-HBV tablets and oral solution, zidovudine tablets, capsules, syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA(R) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenifovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was co administered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablet should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine tablet should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Childs Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Co-administration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: -Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. -Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. -Exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. -Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and Hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. -Immune reconstitution syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. -Fat redistribution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. -Myocardial infarction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. The most commonly reported adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity (incidence greater than 5%) in an adult HIV-1 clinical trial were drug hypersensitivity, insomnia, depression/depressed mood, headache/migraine, fatigue/malaise, dizziness/vertigo, nausea, and diarrhea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ViiV Healthcare at 1-877-844-8872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Serious and Fatal Abacavir-associated Hypersensitivity Reactions In clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of EPZICOM [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome. Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized). Additional Adverse Reactions with Use of EPZICOM Therapy-naive Adults: Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily or ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily, are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Treatment-emergent (All Causality) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity (Grades 2-4, Greater than or Equal to 5% Frequency) in Therapy-naive Adults (CNA30021) through 48 Weeks of Treatment Adverse Event ZIAGEN 600 mg q.d. plus EPIVIR plus Efavirenz (n = 384) ZIAGEN 300 mg b.i.d. plus EPIVIR plus Efavirenz (n = 386) Drug hypersensitivity a,b 9% 7% Insomnia 7% 9% Depression/Depressed mood 7% 7% Headache/Migraine 7% 6% Fatigue/Malaise 6% 8% Dizziness/Vertigo 6% 6% Nausea 5% 6% Diarrheaa 5% 6% Rash 5% 5% Pyrexia 5% 3% Abdominal pain/gastritis 4% 5% Abnormal dreams 4% 5% Anxiety 3% 5% aSubjects receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily, experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of subjects receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of subjects receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of subjects receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily had this event. bCNA30024 was a multi-center, double-blind, controlled trial in which 649 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either ZIAGEN (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily); or zidovudine (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). CNA30024 used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded portion of the trial, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 subjects in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 subjects in the zidovudine group. Laboratory Abnormalities: Laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials of ZIAGEN were anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and elevations of CPK, blood glucose, and triglycerides. Additional laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials of EPIVIR were thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of bilirubin, amylase, and lipase. The frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were comparable between treatment groups in CNA30021. Other Adverse Events: In addition to adverse reactions listed above, other adverse events observed in the expanded access program for abacavir were pancreatitis and increased GGT. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine, administered as either single products or as EPZICOM, was assessed in the ARROW trial (n = 336). Primary safety assessment in the ARROW (COL105677) trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator. No additional safety issues were identified in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir and lamivudine once-daily compared with historical data in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Abacavir Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction. Skin: Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Abacavir and Lamivudine Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Digestive: Stomatitis. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Aplastic anemia, anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly. Hepatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypersensitivity: Sensitization reactions (including anaphylaxis), urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Nervous: Paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures. Respiratory: Abnormal breath sounds/wheezing. Skin: Alopecia, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Discontinue EPZICOM as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) -Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (5.5, 5.6) -EPZICOM is not recommended with other products containing abacavir or lamivudine or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.8) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of EPZICOM. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making. Due to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir: - All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with EPZICOM or reinitiation of therapy with EPZICOM, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment. - EPZICOM is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients. - Before starting EPZICOM, review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing product. NEVER restart EPZICOM or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status. - To reduce the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, discontinue EPZICOM immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications). - If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, do not restart EPZICOM or any other abacavir-containing products because more severe symptoms, which may include life-threatening hypotension and death, can occur within hours. - If a hypersensitivity reaction is ruled out, patients may restart EPZICOM. Rarely, patients who have stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity have also experienced life-threatening reactions within hours of reinitiating abacavir therapy. Therefore, reintroduction of EPZICOM or any other abacavir-containing product is recommended only if medical care can be readily accessed. - A Medication Guide and Warning Card that provide information about recognition of hypersensitivity reactions should be dispensed with each new prescription and refill. 5.2 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. See full prescribing information for ZIAGEN (abacavir) and EPIVIR (lamivudine). Treatment with EPZICOM should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.3 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). 5.4 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and EPZICOM should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). Discontinuation of EPZICOM should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). 5.5 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EPZICOM. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.6 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.7 Myocardial Infarction In a published prospective, observational, epidemiological trial designed to investigate the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy, the use of abacavir within the previous 6 months was correlated with an increased risk of MI. In a sponsor-conducted pooled analysis of clinical trials, no excess risk of MI was observed in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. In totality, the available data from the observational cohort and from clinical trials are inconclusive. As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking). 5.8 Related Products that are Not Recommended EPZICOM contains fixed doses of 2 nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir and lamivudine); concomitant administration of EPZICOM with other products containing abacavir or lamivudine is not recommended. In addition, do not administer EPZICOM in combination with products containing emtricitabine."

Lamivudine Tablets 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving Lamivudine tablets 300 mg once daily or Lamivudine tablets 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR(R). Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR(R) and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of Lamivudine Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued Lamivudine Tablets. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of Lamivudine Tablets appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue Lamivudine Tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering Lamivudine Tablets to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with Lamivudine Tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine Tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) Tabletn. EPIVIR-HBV(R) was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV(R) are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV(R) is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, Lamivudine Tablets, EPIVIR(R) Oral Solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV(R) for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Use With Other Lamivudine- and Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine Tablets should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV(R) Tablets, EPIVIR(R) Oral Solution, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). 5.4 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Lamivudine Tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use with the following drugs should be avoided: stavudine (7.1), doxorubicin (7.2). Ethanol: Decreases the elimination of abacavir. (7.3) Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.4) Methadone: An increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. (7.6) No drug interaction trials have been conducted using abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]. 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Zidovudine Stavudine: Concomitant use of zidovudine with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine Concomitant use of zidovudine with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Ethanol Abacavir Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.4 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.5 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6), CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 7.6 Methadone Abacavir The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir. In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of ZIAGEN(R) twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients. 7.7 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine No change in dose of either drug is recommended [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP."

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to abacavir, lamivudine and/or zidovudine. Abacavir Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction. Skin: Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use.

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: hypersensitivity reactions, hematologic toxicity, myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Discontinue abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.7) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.8) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy Abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered with other products containing abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine; or with emtricitabine. (5.11) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reaction Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets and other abacavir-containing products. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at high risk for experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Prior to initiating therapy with abacavir, screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele is recommended; this approach has been found to decrease the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. For HLA-B*5701-positive patients, treatment with an abacavir-containing regimen is not recommended and should be considered only with close medical supervision and under exceptional circumstances when the potential benefit outweighs the risk. HLA-B*5701-negative patients may develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir; however, this occurs significantly less frequently than in HLA-B*5701-positive patients. Regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, permanently discontinue abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible. Important information on signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, as well as clinical management, is presented below. Signs and Symptoms of Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity to abacavir is a multi-organ clinical syndrome usually characterized by a sign or symptom in 2 or more of the following groups. Group 1: Fever Group 2: Rash Group 3: Gastrointestinal (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain) Group 4: Constitutional (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness) Group 5: Respiratory (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis) Hypersensitivity to abacavir following the presentation of a single sign or symptom has been reported infrequently. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 8% of 2,670 subjects (n = 206) in 9 clinical trials (range: 2% to 9%) with enrollment from November 1999 to February 2002. Data on time to onset and symptoms of suspected hypersensitivity were collected on a detailed data collection module. The frequencies of symptoms are shown in Figure 1. Symptoms usually appeared within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir, although the reaction may occur at any time during therapy. Median time to onset was 9 days; 89% appeared within the first 6 weeks; 95% of subjects reported symptoms from 2 or more of the 5 groups listed above. A trial with ZIAGEN(R) (abacavir sulfate) used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded portion of the trial, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 subjects in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 subjects in the zidovudine group. Figure 1. Hypersensitivity-Related Symptoms Reported with >=10% Frequency in Clinical Trials (n = 206 Subjects) Other less common signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity include lethargy, myolysis, edema, abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which can be localized), and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death have occurred in association with hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir in some subjects include lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and rash. The rash usually appears maculopapular or urticarial, but may be variable in appearance. There have been reports of erythema multiforme. Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred without rash. Laboratory abnormalities associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir in some subjects include elevated liver function tests, elevated creatinine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia. Clinical Management of Hypersensitivity Discontinue abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as soon as a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. To minimize the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, permanently discontinue abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications). Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, NEVER restart abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets or any other abacavir-containing product because more severe symptoms can occur within hours and may include life-threatening hypotension and death. When therapy with abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets has been discontinued for reasons other than symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction, and if reinitiation of abacavir is under consideration, carefully evaluate the reason for discontinuation to ensure that the patient did not have symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If the patient is of unknown HLA-B*5701 status, screening for the allele is recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. If hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, DO NOT reintroduce abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets or any other abacavir-containing product. Even in the absence of the HLA-B*5701 allele, it is important to permanently discontinue abacavir and not rechallenge with abacavir if a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction. If symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity are not identified, reintroduction can be undertaken with continued monitoring for symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. Make patients aware that a hypersensitivity reaction can occur with reintroduction of abacavir and that abacavir reintroduction needs to be undertaken only if medical care can be readily accessed by the patient or others. Risk Factor HLA-B*5701 Allele: Trials have shown that carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele is associated with a significantly increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. CNA106030 (PREDICT-1), a randomized, double-blind trial, evaluated the clinical utility of prospective HLA-B*5701 screening on the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction in abacavir-naive HIV-1-infected adults (n = 1,650). In this trial, use of pre-therapy screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele and exclusion of subjects with this allele reduced the incidence of clinically suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions from 7.8% (66/847) to 3.4% (27/803). Based on this trial, it is estimated that 61% of patients with the HLA-B*5701 allele will develop a clinically suspected hypersensitivity reaction during the course of abacavir treatment compared with 4% of patients who do not have the HLA-B*5701 allele. Screening for carriage of the HLA-B*5701 allele is recommended prior to initiating treatment with abacavir. Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. For HLA-B*5701-positive patients, initiating or reinitiating treatment with an abacavir-containing regimen is not recommended and should be considered only with close medical supervision and under exceptional circumstances where potential benefit outweighs the risk. Skin patch testing is used as a research tool and should not be used to aid in the clinical diagnosis of abacavir hypersensitivity. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision-making. Even in the absence of the HLA-B*5701 allele, it is important to permanently discontinue abacavir and not rechallenge with abacavir if a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction. 5.2 Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.3 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. 5.4 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including abacavir, lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.5 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected subjects treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from post-marketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether reinitiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. In non-HIV-infected subjects treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV(R) [lamivudine] for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected subjects receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is not advised. 5.7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.8 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.9 Myocardial Infarction In a published prospective, observational, epidemiological trial designed to investigate the rate of myocardial infarction in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy, the use of abacavir within the previous 6 months was correlated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI)1. In a sponsor-conducted pooled analysis of clinical trials, no excess risk of myocardial infarction was observed in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. In totality, the available data from the observational cohort and from clinical trials are inconclusive. As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking). 5.10 Therapy-Experienced Patients In clinical trials, subjects with prolonged prior nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) exposure or who had HIV-1 isolates that contained multiple mutations conferring resistance to NRTIs had limited response to abacavir. The potential for cross-resistance between abacavir and other NRTIs should be considered when choosing new therapeutic regimens in therapy-experienced patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.4)]. 5.11 Use With Other Abacavir-, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine- Containing Products Abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is a fixed-dose combination of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine and is intended only for patients whose regimen would otherwise include these 3 components. Abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered concomitantly with other abacavir-, lamivudine-, or zidovudine-containing products including ZIAGEN(R) (abacavir sulfate) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, COMBIVIR(R) (lamivudine and zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) Tablets, EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine) Capsules and Oral Solution, TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) Tablets, or COMPLERA(TM) (emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) Tablets. The complete prescribing information for all agents being considered for use with abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be consulted before combination therapy with abacavir sulfate, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet is initiated.

The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). [see Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3)]. No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine.

The safety profile of lamivudine in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-l-infected subjects in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions of in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects during therapy with lamivudine 150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR (R) 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3.

Lamivudine 300 mg Once Daily : The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving lamivudine 300 mg once daily or lamivudine 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4.

Pancreatitis Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric subjects receiving lamivudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation trial (NUCA2002), 14 subjects (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these subjects died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label trial (NUCA2005), 12 subjects (18%) developed pancreatitis. In trial ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 subjects randomized to lamivudine plus zidovudine. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 subject in this trial who received open- label lamivudine in combination with zidovudine and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, 6 subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and 2 subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Additional pediatric use information for patients aged 3 months and above is approved for ViiV Healthcare Company's EPIVIR (R) (lamivudine) tablets and oral solution. However, due to ViiV Healthcare Company's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Neonates Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic Hyperglycemia. General Weakness Hemic and Lymphatic Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy).

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS - Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. ( 5.2) - Emtricitabine-containing products should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. ( 5.3) - Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment- associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. ( 5.4) - Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. ( 5.5) - Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. ( 5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine.These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR- HBV Tablets. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine- regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine.These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Important Differences among Lamivudine-containing Products Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR- HBV Tablets. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, lamivudine oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine- containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Related Products that are Not Recommended Lamivudine is one of multiple lamivudine-containing products. Concomitant administration of lamivudine with other products containing lamivudine is not recommended. Concomitant use of lamivudine with emtricitabine-containing products is also not recommended. 5.4 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-l/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-l/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV -1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretrovira1 therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interaction studies have been conducted using lamivudine and zidovudine tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use with the following drugs should be avoided: stavudine (7.1), zalcitabine (7.1), doxorubicin (7.2). Bone marrow suppressive/cytotoxic agents: May increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. (7.3) 7.1 Antiretroviral Agents Lamivudine: Zalcitabine: Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. Zidovudine: Stavudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with stavudine should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. Nucleoside Analogues Affecting DNA Replication: Some nucleoside analogues affecting DNA replication, such as ribavirin, antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of zidovudine against HIV-1; concomitant use of such drugs should be avoided. 7.2 Doxorubicin Zidovudine: Concomitant use of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets with doxorubicin should be avoided since an antagonistic relationship with zidovudine has been demonstrated in vitro. 7.3 Hematologic/Bone Marrow Suppressive/Cytotoxic Agents Zidovudine: Coadministration of ganciclovir, interferon alfa, ribavirin, and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents may increase the hematologic toxicity of zidovudine. 7.4 Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens Lamivudine: Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) Lamivudine: No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-888-838-2872, X6351 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Lamivudine Plus Zidovudine Administered As Separate Formulations: In 4 randomized, controlled trials of EPIVIR (lamivudine) 300 mg per day plus RETROVIR (zidovudine) 600 mg per day, the following selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were observed (see Tables 1 and 2 ). Table 1. Selected Clinical Adverse Reactions (>= 5% Frequency) in 4 Controlled Clinical Trials With EPIVIR (Lamivudine) 300 mg/day and RETROVIR (Zidovudine) 600 mg/day Adverse Reaction EPIVIR (Lamivudine) plus RETROVIR (Zidovudine) (n = 251) Body as a whole Headache 35% Malaise & fatigue 27% Fever or chills 10% Digestive Nausea 33% Diarrhea 18% Nausea & vomiting 13% Anorexia and/or decreased appetite 10% Abdominal pain 9% Abdominal cramps 6% Dyspepsia 5% Nervous system Neuropathy 12% Insomnia & other sleep disorders 11% Dizziness 10% Depressive disorders 9% Respiratory Nasal signs & symptoms 20% Cough 18% Skin Skin rashes 9% Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal pain 12% Myalgia 8% Arthralgia 5% Pancreatitis was observed in 9 of the 2,613 adult patients (0.3%) who received EPIVIR (lamivudine) in controlled clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are listed in Table 2. Table 2. Frequencies of Selected Laboratory Abnormalities Among Adults in 4 Controlled Clinical Trials of EPIVIR (Lamivudine) 300 mg/day Plus RETROVIR (Zidovudine) 600 mg/dayFrequencies of these laboratory abnormalities were higher in patients with mild laboratory abnormalities at baseline.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See boxed warning for information about the following: hematologic toxicity, symptomatic myopathy, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly, and severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products or emtricitabine-containing products. (5.5) Hepatic decompensation, some fatal, has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon alfa with/without ribavirin. Discontinue lamivudine and zidovudine tablets as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.6) Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. (5.6) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.7) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.8) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.9) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. 5.1 Hemotologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression Zidovudine, a component of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells/mm3 or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed. 5.2 Myopathy Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. 5.3 Lactic Acidosis/Hepatomegaly With Steatosis Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine and zidovudine tablets to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4 Patients With HIV-1 and Hepatitis B Virus Co-Infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV DNA). Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV(R) (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for treating chronic hepatitis B. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.5 Use With Other, Lamivudine-, Zidovudine-, and/or Emtricitabine-Containing Products Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets are a fixed-dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine- or zidovudine-containing products including EPIVIR (lamivudine) Tablets and Oral Solution, EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and Oral Solution, RETROVIR(R) (zidovudine) Tablets, Capsules, Syrup, and IV Infusion, EPZICOM(R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR(R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets; or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA(R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA(R) (emtricitabine), TRUVADA(R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir) or COMPLERA(TM) (rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir). 5.6 Use With Interferon- and Ribavirin-Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine and zidovudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine or zidovudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, neutropenia, and anemia. Discontinuation of lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6) (see the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin). Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving ribavirin and zidovudine. Coadministration of ribavirin and zidovudine is not advised. 5.7 Pancreatitis Lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis. Treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.9 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim) [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine."

In an open-label dose-escalation trial (NUCA2002), 14 subjects (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these subjects died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label trial (NUCA2005), 12 subjects (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Trial ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 subjects randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR(R)*. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 subject in this trial who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, 6 subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and 2 subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

However, due to ViiV Healthcare Company's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Neonates Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)] . Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine-containing products should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation some fatal has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue lamivudine as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome and redistribution/accumulation of body fat have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (5.6, 5.7) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Caution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.2 Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. Important Differences among Lamivudine-containing Products Lamivudine tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, EPIVIR oral solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. 5.3 Related Products that are Not Recommended Lamivudine tablet is one of multiple lamivudine-containing products. Concomitant administration of lamivudine tablets with other products containing lamivudine is not recommended. Concomitant use of lamivudine tablet with emtricitabine-containing products is also not recommended. 5.4 Use with Interferon- and Ribavirin-based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and lamivudine should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of lamivudine should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh greater than 6). See the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. 5.5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."

        "DRUG INTERACTIONS Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim). No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients, hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lamivudine and zalcitabine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another. Therefore, use of lamivudine in combination with zalcitabine is not recommended. No change in dose of either drug is recommended. There is no information regarding the effect on lamivudine pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP/SMX such as those used to treat PCP. A drug interaction study showed no clinically significant interaction between EPIVIR and zidovudine."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common reported adverse reactions (incidence >=15%) in adults were headache, nausea, malaise and fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea, and cough. (6.1) The most common reported adverse reactions (incidence >=15%) in pediatric patients were fever and cough. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hepatic decompensation in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and Hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adults - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: The safety profile of EPIVIR in adults is primarily based on 3,568 HIV-1-infected patients in 7 clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough. Selected clinical adverse reactions in >=5% of patients during therapy with EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily plus RETROVIR (R) 200 mg 3 times daily for up to 24 weeks are listed in Table 3. Table 3.

EPIVIR 300 mg Once Daily: The types and frequencies of clinical adverse reactions reported in patients receiving EPIVIR 300 mg once daily or EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) for 48 weeks were similar. Selected laboratory abnormalities observed during therapy are summarized in Table 4. Table 4. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3-4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults in Four 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies (NUCA3001, NUCA3002, NUCB3001, NUCB3002) and a Clinical Endpoint Study (NUCB3007) Test (Threshold Level) 24-Week Surrogate Endpoint Studies a Clinical Endpoint Study a EPIVIR plus RETROVIR RETROVIR b EPIVIR plus Current Therapy Placebo plus Current Therapy c Absolute neutrophil count (<750/mm 3) 7.2% 5.4% 15% 13% Hemoglobin (<8.0 g/dL) 2.9% 1.8% 2.2% 3.4% Platelets (<50,000/mm 3) 0.4% 1.3% 2.8% 3.8% ALT (>5.0 x ULN) 3.7% 3.6% 3.8% 1.9% AST (>5.0 x ULN) 1.7% 1.8% 4.0% 2.1% Bilirubin (>2.5 x ULN) 0.8% 0.4% ND ND Amylase (>2.0 x ULN) 4.2% 1.5% 2.2% 1.1% a The median duration on study was 12 months. b Either zidovudine monotherapy or zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine. c Current therapy was either zidovudine, zidovudine plus didanosine, or zidovudine plus zalcitabine.

The frequencies of selected laboratory abnormalities reported in patients receiving EPIVIR 300 mg once daily or EPIVIR 150 mg twice daily (in 3-drug combination regimens in EPV20001 and EPV40001) were similar. Pediatric Patients - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: EPIVIR Oral Solution has been studied in 638 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age in 3 clinical trials. Selected clinical adverse reactions and physical findings with a >=5% frequency during therapy with EPIVIR 4 mg/kg twice daily plus RETROVIR 160 mg/m 2 3 times daily in therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 5.

Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, which has been fatal in some cases, has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside-experienced pediatric patients receiving EPIVIR alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In an open-label dose-escalation study (NUCA2002), 14 patients (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with EPIVIR. Three of these patients died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label study (NUCA2005), 12 patients (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Study ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 patients randomized to EPIVIR plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 patient in this study who received open-label EPIVIR in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 patients (15%) in Study NUCA2002, 6 patients (9%) in Study NUCA2005, and 2 patients (<1%) in Study ACTG300. Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (<=56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric patients are listed in Table 6. Table 6.

Neonates - Clinical Trials in HIV-1: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled studies in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known. In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of EPIVIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine. Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Endocrine and Metabolic: Hyperglycemia. General: Weakness. Hemic and Lymphatic: Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy). Hepatic and Pancreatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis, posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia, pruritus."
      "warnings_and_cautions": [
        "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Suspend treatment if clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatoxicity occur. (5.1) Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis: Reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 and discontinued EPIVIR. Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-hepatitis B treatment. (5.2) Patients with HIV-1 infection should receive only dosage forms of EPIVIR appropriate for treatment of HIV-1. (5.2) Co-infected HIV-1/HBV Patients: Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. (5.2) Emtricitabine should not be administered concomitantly with lamivudine-containing products. (5.3) Hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. Monitor for treatment-associated toxicities. Discontinue EPIVIR as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both. (5.4) Pancreatitis: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis. Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate. (5.5) Immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6) and redistribution/accumulation of body fat (5.7) have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including lamivudine and other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering EPIVIR to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases also have been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with EPIVIR should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis: In clinical trials in non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether re-initiation of lamivudine alters the course of posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis. Important Differences Among Lamivudine-Containing Products: EPIVIR Tablets and Oral Solution contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV Tablets and EPIVIR-HBV Oral Solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, EPIVIR Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR (R) (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM (R) (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR (R) (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) Tablets should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen. Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV: In non-HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B, emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected and has been associated with diminished treatment response (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV for additional information). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected patients who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. EPIVIR should not be administered concomitantly with other lamivudine-containing products including EPIVIR-HBV Tablets, EPIVIR Oral Solution, COMBIVIR (lamivudine/zidovudine) Tablets, EPZICOM (abacavir sulfate and lamivudine) Tablets, or TRIZIVIR (abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine) or emtricitabine-containing products, including ATRIPLA (R) (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir), EMTRIVA (R) (emtricitabine), or TRUVADA (R) (emtricitabine and tenofovir). In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction (e.g., loss of HIV-1/HCV virologic suppression) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with lamivudine in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], hepatic decompensation (some fatal) has occurred in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin. Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and EPIVIR should be closely monitored for treatment-associated toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation. Discontinuation of EPIVIR should be considered as medically appropriate. Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa, ribavirin, or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed, including hepatic decompensation (e.g., Child-Pugh >6). See the complete prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin. In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, EPIVIR should be used with caution. Treatment with EPIVIR should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EPIVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established."
