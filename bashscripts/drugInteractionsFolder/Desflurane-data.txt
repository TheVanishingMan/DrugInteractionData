        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No clinically significant adverse interactions with commonly used preanesthetic drugs, or drugs used during anesthesia (muscle relaxants, intravenous agents, and local anesthetic agents) were reported in clinical trials. The effect of SUPRANE on the disposition of other drugs has not been determined. Similar to isoflurane, SUPRANE does not predispose to premature ventricular arrhythmias in the presence of exogenously infused epinephrine in swine. -Concomitant use of N2O, benzodiazepines and/or opioids reduces the MAC of SUPRANE. Adjust dose accordingly. (7.1, 7.3) -SUPRANE decreases the doses of neuromuscular blocking agents required. Adjust dose accordingly. (7.2) 7.1 Benzodiazepines and Opioids (MAC Reduction) Benzodiazepines and opioids decrease the amount of desflurane (MAC) needed to produce anesthesia. This effect is shown in Table 3 for intravenous midazolam (25-50 µg/kg) and intravenous fentanyl (3-6 µg/kg) in patients of two different age groups. Table 3 SUPRANE MAC with Fentanyl or Midazolam Mean ± SD (percent reduction) Dose 18-30 years 31-65 years No fentanyl 6.4 ± 0.0 6.3 ± 0.4 3 µg/kg fentanyl 3.5 ± 1.9 (46%) 3.1 ± 0.6 (51%) 6 µg/kg fentanyl 3.0 ± 1.2 (53%) 2.3 ± 1.0 (64%) No midazolam 6.9 ± 0.1 5.9 ± 0.6 25 µg/kg midazolam - 4.9 ± 0.9 (16%) 50 µg/kg midazolam - 4.9 ± 0.5 (17%) 7.2 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Anesthetic concentrations of desflurane at equilibrium (administered for 15 or more minutes before testing) reduced the ED95 of succinylcholine by approximately 30% and that of atracurium and pancuronium by approximately 50% compared to N2O/opioid anesthesia (see Table 4). The effect of desflurane on duration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade has not been studied. Table 4 Dosage of Muscle Relaxant Causing 95% Depression in Neuromuscular Blockade Desflurane Concentration Mean ED95 (µg/kg) Pancuronium Atracurium Succinylcholine Vecuronium 0.65 MAC 60% N2O/O2 26 133 - - 1.25 MAC 60% N2O/O2 18 119 - - 1.25 MAC O2 22 120 360 19 Dosage reduction of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation, because potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents requires equilibration of muscle with the delivered partial pressure of SUPRANE. Among nondepolarizing drugs, pancuronium, atracurium, and vecuronium interactions have been studied. In the absence of specific guidelines: -For endotracheal intubation, do not reduce the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants or succinylcholine. -During maintenance of anesthesia, the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is likely to be reduced compared to that during N2O/opioid anesthesia. Administration of supplemental doses of muscle relaxants should be guided by the response to nerve stimulation. 7.3 Concomitant use with N2O Concomitant administration of N2O reduces the MAC of SUPRANE [see Dosage and Administration (2), Table 1]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence> 10%) are coughing, breath holding, apnea, nausea, vomiting. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare Corporation at 1-800-262-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Adverse event information is derived from controlled clinical trials, the majority of which were conducted in the United States. The studies were conducted using a variety of premedications, other anesthetics, and surgical procedures of varying length. Most adverse events reported were mild and transient, and may reflect the surgical procedures, patient characteristics (including disease) and/or medications administered. Of the 2,143 patients exposed to SUPRANE in clinical trials, 370 adults and 152 children were induced with desflurane alone and 987 patients were maintained principally with desflurane. The frequencies given reflect the percent of patients with the event. Each patient was counted once for each type of adverse event. They are presented in alphabetical order according to body system.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Malignant hyperthermia may occur. (5.1) -Perioperative hyperkalemia may occur. Patients with latent or overt neuromuscular disease, particularly with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, appear to be most vulnerable. (5.2) -SUPRANE may cause sensitivity hepatitis in patients sensitized by previous exposure to halogenated anesthetics. (4, 5.5) -SUPRANE is not approved for maintenance of anesthesia in non-intubated children due to an increased incidence of respiratory adverse reactions. (5.3, 8.4) -SUPRANE may cause airway narrowing and increased airway resistance in children with Bronchial hyperreactivity. (5.3) -SUPRANE can react with desiccated CO2 absorbents to produce carbon monoxide. (5.4) -There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant or lactating women or during labor and delivery. SUPRANE is a uterine relaxant. (8.1, 8.2, 8.3) 5.1 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, potent inhalation anesthetic agents may trigger a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand and the clinical syndrome known as malignant hyperthermia. In genetically susceptible pigs, desflurane induced malignant hyperthermia. The clinical syndrome is signaled by hypercapnia, and may include muscle rigidity, tachycardia, tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, and/or unstable blood pressure. Some of these nonspecific signs may also appear during light anesthesia: acute hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hypovolemia. Treatment of malignant hyperthermia includes discontinuation of triggering agents, administration of intravenous dantrolene sodium, and application of supportive therapy. (Consult prescribing information for dantrolene sodium intravenous for additional information on patient management.) Renal failure may appear later, and urine flow should be monitored and sustained if possible. Fatal outcome of malignant hyperthermia has been reported with desflurane. 5.2 Perioperative Hyperkalemia Use of inhaled anesthetic agents has been associated with rare increases in serum potassium levels that have resulted in cardiac arrhythmias and death in pediatric patients during the postoperative period. Patients with latent as well as overt neuromuscular disease, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy, appear to be most vulnerable. Concomitant use of succinylcholine has been associated with most, but not all, of these cases. These patients also experienced significant elevations in serum creatinine kinase levels and, in some cases, changes in urine consistent with myoglobinuria. Despite the similarity in presentation to malignant hyperthermia, none of these patients exhibited signs or symptoms of muscle rigidity or hypermetabolic state. Early and aggressive intervention to treat the hyperkalemia and resistant arrhythmias is recommended, as is subsequent evaluation for latent neuromuscular disease. 5.3 Respiratory Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients SUPRANE is not approved for maintenance of anesthesia in non-intubated children due to an increased incidence of respiratory adverse reactions, including coughing, laryngospasm and secretions [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Children, particularly if 6 years old or younger, who are under an anesthetic maintenance of SUPRANE delivered via laryngeal mask airway (LMA(TM) mask) are at increased risk for adverse respiratory reactions, e.g., coughing and laryngospasm, especially with removal of the laryngeal mask airway under deep anesthesia [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Therefore, closely monitor these patients for signs and symptoms associated with laryngospasm and treat accordingly. When SUPRANE is used for maintenance of anesthesia in children with asthma or a history of recent upper airway infection, there is an increased risk for airway narrowing and increases in airway resistance. Therefore, closely monitor these patients for signs and symptoms associated with airway narrowing and treat accordingly. 5.4 Interactions with Desiccated Carbon Dioxide Absorbents Desflurane like some other inhalation anesthetics, can react with desiccated carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbents to produce carbon monoxide that may result in elevated levels of carboxyhemoglobin in some patients. Case reports suggest that barium hydroxide lime and soda lime become desiccated when fresh gases are passed through the CO2 canister at high flow rates over many hours or days. When a clinician suspects that CO2 absorbent may be desiccated, it should be replaced before the administration of SUPRANE. 5.5 Hepatobiliary Disorders With the use of halogenated anesthetics, disruption of hepatic function, icterus and fatal liver necrosis have been reported; such reactions appear to indicate hypersensitivity. As with other halogenated anesthetic agents, SUPRANE may cause sensitivity hepatitis in patients who have been sensitized by previous exposure to halogenated anesthetics [see Contraindications (4)]. Cirrhosis, viral hepatitis or other pre-existing hepatic disease may be a reason to select an anesthetic other than a halogenated anesthetic. As with all halogenated anesthetics, repeated anesthesia within a short period of time should be approached with caution. 5.6 Laboratory Findings Transient elevations in glucose and white blood cell count may occur as with use of other anesthetic agents."

Treatment of malignant hyperthermia includes discontinuation of triggering agents, administration of intravenous dantrolene sodium, and application of supportive therapy. (Consult prescribing information for dantrolene sodium intravenous for additional information on patient management.) Renal failure may appear later, and urine flow should be monitored and sustained if possible. Fatal outcome of malignant hyperthermia has been reported with desflurane. 5.2 Perioperative Hyperkalemia Use of inhaled anesthetic agents has been associated with rare increases in serum potassium levels that have resulted in cardiac arrhythmias and death in pediatric patients during the postoperative period. Patients with latent as well as overt neuromuscular disease, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy, appear to be most vulnerable. Concomitant use of succinylcholine has been associated with most, but not all, of these cases. These patients also experienced significant elevations in serum creatinine kinase levels and, in some cases, changes in urine consistent with myoglobinuria. Despite the similarity in presentation to malignant hyperthermia, none of these patients exhibited signs or symptoms of muscle rigidity or hypermetabolic state. Early and aggressive intervention to treat the hyperkalemia and resistant arrhythmias is recommended, as is subsequent evaluation for latent neuromuscular disease. 5.3 Respiratory Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients SUPRANE is not approved for maintenance of anesthesia in non-intubated children due to an increased incidence of respiratory adverse reactions, including coughing, laryngospasm and secretions [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Children, particularly if 6 years or younger, who are under an anesthetic maintenance of SUPRANE delivered via laryngeal mask airway (LMA TM mask) are at increased risk for adverse respiratory reactions, e.g., coughing and laryngospasm, especially with removal of the laryngeal mask airway under deep anesthesia [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Therefore, closely monitor these patients for signs and symptoms associated with laryngospasm and treat accordingly. When SUPRANE is used for maintenance of anesthesia in children with asthma or a history of recent upper airway infection, there is an increased risk for airway narrowing and increases in airway resistance. Therefore, closely monitor these patients for signs and symptoms associated with airway narrowing and treat accordingly. 5.4 Interactions with Desiccated Carbon Dioxide Absorbents Desflurane like some other inhalation anesthetics, can react with desiccated carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbents to produce carbon monoxide that may result in elevated levels of carboxyhemoglobin in some patients. Case reports suggest that barium hydroxide lime and soda lime become desiccated when fresh gases are passed through the CO2 canister at high flow rates over many hours or days. When a clinician suspects that CO2 absorbent may be desiccated, it should be replaced before the administration of SUPRANE. 5.5 Hepatobiliary Disorders With the use of halogenated anesthetics, disruption of hepatic function, icterus and fatal liver necrosis have been reported; such reactions appear to indicate hypersensitivity. As with other halogenated anesthetic agents. SUPRANE may cause sensitivity hepatitis in patients who have been sensitized by previous exposure to halogenated anesthetics [see Contraindications (4)]. Cirrhosis, viral hepatitis or other pre-existing hepatic disease may be a reason to select an anesthetic other than a halogenated anesthetic. As with all halogenated anesthetics, repeated anesthesia within a short period of time should be approached with caution. 5.6 Laboratory Findings Transient elevations in glucose and white blood cell count may occur as with use of other anesthetic agents."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No clinically significant adverse interactions with commonly used preanesthetic drugs, or drugs used during anesthesia (muscle relaxants, intravenous agents, and local anesthetic agents) were reported in clinical trials. The effect of SUPRANE on the disposition of other drugs has not been determined. Similar to isoflurane, SUPRANE does not predispose to premature ventricular arrhythmias in the presence of exogenously infused epinephrine in swine. -Concomitant use of N2O, benzodiazepines and/or opioids reduces the MAC of SUPRANE. Adjust dose accordingly. (7.1, 7.3) -SUPRANE decreases the doses of neuromuscular blocking agents required. Adjust dose accordingly. (7.2) 7.1 Benzodiazepines and Opioids (MAC Reduction) Benzodiazepines and opioids decrease the amount of desflurane (MAC) needed to produce anesthesia. This effect is shown in Table 3 for intravenous midazolam (25-50 µg/kg) and intravenous fentanyl (3-6 µg/kg) in patients of two different age groups. Table 3 SUPRANE (desflurane, USP) MAC with Fentanyl or Midazolam Mean ± SD (percent reduction) Dose 18-30 years 31-65 years No fentanyl 6.4 ± 0.0 6.3 ± 0.4 3 µg/kg fentanyl 3.5 ± 1.9 (46%) 3.1 ± 0.6 (51%) 6 µg/kg fentanyl 3.0 ± 1.2 (53%) 2.3 ± 1.0 (64%) No midazolam 6.9 ± 0.1 5.9 ± 0.6 25 µg/kg midazolam - 4.9 ± 0.9 (16%) 50 µg/kg midazolam - 4.9 ± 0.5 (17%) 7.2 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Anesthetic concentrations of desflurane at equilibrium (administered for 15 or more minutes before testing) reduced the ED95 of succinylcholine by approximately 30% and that of atracurium and pancuronium by approximately 50% compared to N2O/opioid anesthesia (see Table 4). The effect of desflurane on duration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade has not been studied. Table 4 Dosage of Muscle Relaxant Causing 95% Depression in Neuromuscular Blockade Desflurane Concentration Mean ED95 (µg/kg) Pancuronium Atracurium Succinylcholine Vecuronium 0.65 MAC 60% N2O/O2 26 133 - - 1.25 MAC 60% N2O/O2 18 119 - - 1.25 MAC O2 22 120 360 19 Dosage reduction of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation, because potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents requires equilibration of muscle with the delivered partial pressure of SUPRANE. Among nondepolarizing drugs, pancuronium, atracurium, and vecuronium interactions have been studied. In the absence of specific guidelines: 1.For endotracheal intubation, do not reduce the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants or succinylcholine. 2.During maintenance of anesthesia, the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is likely to be reduced compared to that during N2O/opioid anesthesia. Administration of supplemental doses of muscle relaxants should be guided by the response to nerve stimulation. 7.3 Concomitant use with N2O Concomitant administration of N2O reduces the MAC of SUPRANE [see Dosage and Administration (2), Table 1]."

        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence> 10%) are coughing, breath holding, apnea, nausea, vomiting. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare Corporation at 1-800-262-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Adverse event information is derived from controlled clinical trials, the majority of which were conducted in the United States. The studies were conducted using a variety of premedications, other anesthetics, and surgical procedures of varying length. Most adverse events reported were mild and transient, and may reflect the surgical procedures, patient characteristics (including disease) and/or medications administered. Of the 2,143 patients exposed to SUPRANE in clinical trials, 370 adults and 152 children were induced with desflurane alone and 987 patients were maintained principally with desflurane. The frequencies given reflect the percent of patients with the event. Each patient was counted once for each type of adverse event. They are presented in alphabetical order according to body system. Table 2 Frequency of Events Occurring in Greater Than 1% of Clinical Trial Patients (in Reports Deemed "Probably Causally Related") Induction (use as a mask inhalation agent) Adult Patients (N=370): Coughing 34%, breathholding 30%, apnea 15%, increased secretionsIncidence of events 3% - 10%, laryngospasm, oxyhemoglobin desaturation (SpO2 < 90%), pharyngitis.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Malignant hyperthermia may occur. (5.1) -Perioperative hyperkalemia may occur. Patients with latent or overt neuromuscular disease, particularly with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, appear to be most vulnerable. (5.2) -SUPRANE may cause sensitivity hepatitis in patients sensitized by previous exposure to halogenated anesthetics. (4, 5.5) -SUPRANE is not approved for maintenance of anesthesia in non-intubated children due to an increased incidence of respiratory adverse reactions. (5.3, 8.4) -SUPRANE may cause airway narrowing and increased airway resistance in children with Bronchial hyperreactivity. (5.3) -SUPRANE can react with desiccated CO2 absorbents to produce carbon monoxide. (5.4) -There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant or lactating women or during labor and delivery. SUPRANE is a uterine relaxant. (8.1, 8.2, 8.3) 5.1 Malignant Hyperthermia In susceptible individuals, potent inhalation anesthetic agents may trigger a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand and the clinical syndrome known as malignant hyperthermia. In genetically susceptible pigs, desflurane induced malignant hyperthermia. The clinical syndrome is signaled by hypercapnia, and may include muscle rigidity, tachycardia, tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, and/or unstable blood pressure. Some of these nonspecific signs may also appear during light anesthesia: acute hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hypovolemia. Treatment of malignant hyperthermia includes discontinuation of triggering agents, administration of intravenous dantrolene sodium, and application of supportive therapy. (Consult prescribing information for dantrolene sodium intravenous for additional information on patient management.)
