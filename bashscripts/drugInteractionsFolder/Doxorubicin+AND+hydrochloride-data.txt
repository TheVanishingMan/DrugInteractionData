        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin HCl with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P-gp (7.1). Do not administer doxorubicin HCl in combination with trastuzumab due to increased risk of cardiac dysfunction (5.1, 7.2). 7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors, Inducers and P-gp Doxorubicin is a major substrate of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Clinically significant interactions have been reported with inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P-gp (e.g., verapamil), resulting in increased concentration and clinical effect of doxorubicin. Inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John's Wort) and P-gp inducers may decrease the concentration of doxorubicin. Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin HCl with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or P-gp. 7.2 Trastuzumab Concurrent use of trastuzumab and doxorubicin HCl results in an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Avoid concurrent administration of doxorubicin and trastuzumab. The appropriate interval for administering doxorubicin following trastuzumab therapy has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.3 Paclitaxel Paclitaxel, when given prior to doxorubicin HCl, increases the plasma-concentrations of doxorubicin and its metabolites. Administer doxorubicin HCl prior to paclitaxel if used concomitantly. 7.4 Dexrazoxane Do not administer dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant at the initiation of doxorubicin HCl-containing chemotherapy regimens. In a randomized trial in women with metastatic breast cancer, initiation of dexrazoxane with doxorubicin HCl-based chemotherapy resulted in a significantly lower tumor response rate (48% vs. 63%; p=0.007) and shorter time to progression than in women who received doxorubicin HCl-based chemotherapy alone. 7.5 6-Mercaptopurine Doxorubicin HCl may potentiate 6-mercaptopurine-induced hepatotoxicity. In 11 patients with refractory leukemia treated with 6-mercaptopurine (500 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days per cycle every 2–3 weeks) and doxorubicin HCl (50 mg/m2 intravenous once per cycle every 2–3 weeks) alone or with vincristine and prednisone, all developed hepatic dysfunction manifested by elevations of total serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Radiation-induced toxicity can be increased by the administration of doxorubicin HCl. Radiation recall can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin HCl after prior radiation therapy (5.7). Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.8). 5.1 Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmias Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin HCl can result in myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure. The risk of cardiomyopathy is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure. Include prior doses of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones in calculations of total cumulative dosage for doxorubicin HCl. Cardiomyopathy may develop during treatment or up to several years after completion of treatment and can include decrease in LVEF and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). The probability of developing cardiomyopathy is estimated to be 1 to 2% at a total cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin HCl, 3 to 5% at a dose of 400 mg/m2, 5 to 8% at a dose of 450 mg/m2, and 6 to 20% at a dose of 500 mg/m2, when doxorubicin HCl is administered every 3 weeks. There is an additive or potentially synergistic increase in the risk of cardiomyopathy in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum or concomitant therapy with other known cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab. Pericarditis and myocarditis have also been reported during or following doxorubicin HCl treatment. Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g., MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of doxorubicin HCl, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity. Increase the frequency of assessments as the cumulative dose exceeds 300 mg/m2. Use the same method of assessment of LVEF at all time points [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Consider the use of dexrazoxane to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy due to doxorubicin HCl administration in patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin HCl dose of 300 mg/m2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin HCl. Arrhythmias Doxorubicin HCl can result in arrhythmias, including life-threatening arrhythmias, during or within a few hours after doxorubicin HCl administration and at any time point during treatment. Tachyarrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia, as well as bradycardia may occur. Electrocardiographic changes including non-specific ST-T wave changes, atrioventricular and bundle-branch block can also occur. These electrocardiographic changes may be transient and self-limited and may not require dose-modifications of doxorubicin HCl. 5.2 Secondary Malignancies The risk of developing secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is increased following treatment with doxorubicin HCl. Cumulative incidences ranged from 0.2% at five years to 1.5% at 10 years in two separate trials involving the adjuvant treatment of women with breast cancer. These leukemias generally occur within 1 to 3 years of treatment. 5.3 Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis Extravasation of doxorubicin HCl can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulceration, and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting. When given via a peripheral venous line, infuse doxorubicin over 10 minutes or less to minimize the risk of thrombosis or perivenous extravasation. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately terminate the injection or infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Extravasation may be present in patients who do not experience a stinging or burning sensation or when blood return is present on aspiration of the infusion needle. If extravasation is suspected, apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days. If appropriate, administer dexrazoxane at the site of extravasation as soon as possible and within the first 6 hours after extravasation. 5.4 Severe Myelosuppression Doxorubicin HCl can cause myelosuppression. In Study 1, the incidence of severe myelosuppression was: grade 4 leukopenia (0.3%), grade 3 leukopenia (3%), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (0.1%). A dose-dependent, reversible neutropenia is the predominant manifestation of hematologic toxicity from doxorubicin HCl. When doxorubicin HCl is administered every 21 days, the neutrophil count reaches its nadir 10 to 14 days after administration with recovery usually occurring by the 21st day. Obtain baseline assessment of blood counts and carefully monitor patients during treatment for possible clinical complications due to myelosuppression. 5.5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The clearance of doxorubicin is decreased in patients with elevated serum bilirubin with an increased risk of toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce the dose of doxorubicin HCl in patients with serum bilirubin levels of 1.2–5.0 mg/dL [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Doxorubicin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as Child Pugh Class C or serum bilirubin level greater than 5 mg/dL) [see Contraindications (4)]. Obtain liver tests including SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during doxorubicin HCl therapy. 5.6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Doxorubicin HCl may induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Evaluate blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine after initial treatment. Hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia may minimize potential complications of tumor lysis syndrome. 5.7 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Doxorubicin HCl can increase radiation-induced toxicity to the myocardium, mucosa, skin, and liver. Radiation recall, including but not limited to cutaneous and pulmonary toxicity, can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin HCl after prior radiation therapy. 5.8 Embryofetal Toxicity Doxorubicin HCl can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Doxorubicin HCl was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses lower than the recommended human dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with doxorubicin HCl and for 6 months after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking doxorubicin HCl [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.6)]."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Radiation-induced toxicity can be increased by the administration of doxorubicin HCl. Radiation recall can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin HCl after prior radiation therapy (5.7). Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.8). 5.1 Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmias Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin HCl can result in myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure. The risk of cardiomyopathy is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure. Include prior doses of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones in calculations of total cumulative dosage for doxorubicin HCl. Cardiomyopathy may develop during treatment or up to several years after completion of treatment and can include decrease in LVEF and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). The probability of developing cardiomyopathy is estimated to be 1 to 2% at a total cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin HCl, 3 to 5% at a dose of 400 mg/m2, 5 to 8% at a dose of 450 mg/m2, and 6 to 20% at a dose of 500 mg/m2, when doxorubicin HCl is administered every 3 weeks. There is an additive or potentially synergistic increase in the risk of cardiomyopathy in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum or concomitant therapy with other known cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab. Pericarditis and myocarditis have also been reported during or following doxorubicin HCl treatment. Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g., MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of doxorubicin HCl, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity. Increase the frequency of assessments as the cumulative dose exceeds 300 mg/m2. Use the same method of assessment of LVEF at all time points [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Consider the use of dexrazoxane to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy due to doxorubicin HCl administration in patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin HCl dose of 300 mg/m2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin HCl. Arrhythmias Doxorubicin HCl can result in arrhythmias, including life-threatening arrhythmias, during or within a few hours after doxorubicin HCl administration and at any time point during treatment. Tachyarrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia, as well as bradycardia may occur. Electrocardiographic changes including non-specific ST-T wave changes, atrioventricular and bundle-branch block can also occur. These electrocardiographic changes may be transient and self-limited and may not require dose-modifications of doxorubicin HCl. 5.2 Secondary Malignancies The risk of developing secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is increased following treatment with doxorubicin HCl. Cumulative incidences ranged from 0.2% at five years to 1.5% at 10 years in two separate trials involving the adjuvant treatment of women with breast cancer. These leukemias generally occur within 1 to 3 years of treatment. 5.3 Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis Extravasation of doxorubicin HCl can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulceration, and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting. When given via a peripheral venous line, infuse doxorubicin over 10 minutes or less to minimize the risk of thrombosis or perivenous extravasation. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately terminate the injection or infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Extravasation may be present in patients who do not experience a stinging or burning sensation or when blood return is present on aspiration of the infusion needle. If extravasation is suspected, apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days. If appropriate, administer dexrazoxane at the site of extravasation as soon as possible and within the first 6 hours after extravasation. 5.4 Severe Myelosuppression Doxorubicin HCl can cause myelosuppression. In Study 1, the incidence of severe myelosuppression was: grade 4 leukopenia (0.3%), grade 3 leukopenia (3%), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (0.1%). A dose-dependent, reversible neutropenia is the predominant manifestation of hematologic toxicity from doxorubicin HCl. When doxorubicin HCl is administered every 21 days, the neutrophil count reaches its nadir 10 to 14 days after administration with recovery usually occurring by the 21st day. Obtain baseline assessment of blood counts and carefully monitor patients during treatment for possible clinical complications due to myelosuppression. 5.5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The clearance of doxorubicin is decreased in patients with elevated serum bilirubin with an increased risk of toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce the dose of doxorubicin HCl in patients with serum bilirubin levels of 1.2–5.0 mg/dL [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Doxorubicin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as Child Pugh Class C or serum bilirubin level greater than 5 mg/dL) [see Contraindications (4)]. Obtain liver tests including SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during doxorubicin HCl therapy. 5.6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Doxorubicin HCl may induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Evaluate blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine after initial treatment. Hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia may minimize potential complications of tumor lysis syndrome. 5.7 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Doxorubicin HCl can increase radiation-induced toxicity to the myocardium, mucosa, skin, and liver. Radiation recall, including but not limited to cutaneous and pulmonary toxicity, can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin HCl after prior radiation therapy. 5.8 Embryofetal Toxicity Doxorubicin HCl can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Doxorubicin HCl was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses lower than the recommended human dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with doxorubicin HCl and for 6 months after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking doxorubicin HCl [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin HCl with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P-gp (7.1). Do not administer doxorubicin HCl in combination with trastuzumab due to increased risk of cardiac dysfunction (5.1, 7.2). 7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors, Inducers and P-gp Doxorubicin is a major substrate of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Clinically significant interactions have been reported with inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P-gp (e.g., verapamil), resulting in increased concentration and clinical effect of doxorubicin. Inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John's Wort) and P-gp inducers may decrease the concentration of doxorubicin. Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin HCl with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or P-gp. 7.2 Trastuzumab Concurrent use of trastuzumab and doxorubicin HCl results in an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Avoid concurrent administration of doxorubicin and trastuzumab. The appropriate interval for administering doxorubicin following trastuzumab therapy has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.3 Paclitaxel Paclitaxel, when given prior to doxorubicin HCl, increases the plasma-concentrations of doxorubicin and its metabolites. Administer doxorubicin HCl prior to paclitaxel if used concomitantly. 7.4 Dexrazoxane Do not administer dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant at the initiation of doxorubicin HCl-containing chemotherapy regimens.

Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma The safety data described is based on the experience reported in 753 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) enrolled in four open-label, uncontrolled trials of DOXIL administered at doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg/m2 every 2 to 3 weeks. Demographics of the population were: median age 38.7 years (range 24–70); 99% male; 88% Caucasian, 6% Hispanic, 4% Black, and 2% Asian/other/unknown. The majority of patients were treated with 20 mg/m2 of DOXIL every 2 to 3 weeks with a median exposure of 4.2 months (range 1 day to 26.6 months). The median cumulative dose was 120 mg/m2 (range 3.3 to 798.6 mg/m2); 3% received cumulative doses of greater than 450 mg/m2. Disease characteristics were: 61% poor risk for KS tumor burden, 91% poor risk for immune system, and 47% poor risk for systemic illness; 36% were poor risk for all three categories; median CD4 count 21 cells/mm3 (51% less than 50 cells/mm3); mean absolute neutrophil count at study entry approximately 3,000 cells/mm3. Of the 693 patients with concomitant medication information, 59% were on one or more antiretroviral medications [35% zidovudine (AZT), 21% didanosine (ddI), 16% zalcitabine (ddC), and 10% stavudine (D4T)]; 85% received PCP prophylaxis (54% sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim); 85% received antifungal medications (76% fluconazole); 72% received antivirals (56% acyclovir, 29% ganciclovir, and 16% foscarnet) and 48% patients received colony-stimulating factors (sargramostim/filgrastim) during their course of treatment. Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5% of patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and included myelosuppression, cardiac adverse reactions, infusion-related reactions, toxoplasmosis, HFS, pneumonia, cough/dyspnea, fatigue, optic neuritis, progression of a non-KS tumor, allergy to penicillin, and unspecified reasons. Tables 5 and 6 summarize adverse reactions reported in patients treated with DOXIL for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in a pooled analysis of the four trials.

Patients With Multiple Myeloma The safety data described are from 318 patients treated with DOXIL (30 mg/m2) administered on day 4 following bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 i.v. bolus on days 1, 4, 8 and 11) every 3 weeks, in a randomized, open-label, multicenter study (Trial 6). In this trial, patients in the DOXIL + bortezomib combination group were treated for a median number of 4.5 months (range 21 days to 13.5 months). The population was 28 to 85 years of age (median age 61), 58% male, 90% Caucasian, 6% Black, and 4% Asian and Other. Table 7 lists adverse reactions reported in 10% or more of patients treated with DOXIL in combination with bortezomib for multiple myeloma.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hand-Foot Syndrome may occur. Dose modification or discontinuation may be required (5.3) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus. Use effective contraception (5.5, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin HCl can result in myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure. The risk of cardiomyopathy with doxorubicin HCl is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure. The relationship between cumulative DOXIL dose and the risk of cardiac toxicity has not been determined. In a clinical study in 250 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with DOXIL, the risk of cardiotoxicity was 11% when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450–550 mg/m2. Cardiotoxicity was defined as >20% decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline where LVEF remained in the normal range or a >10% decrease in LVEF from baseline where LVEF was less than the institutional lower limit of normal. Two percent of patients developed signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure without documented evidence of cardiotoxicity. Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g. MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of DOXIL, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity. Administer DOXIL to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease only when the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions Serious and sometimes life-threatening infusion-related reactions characterized by one or more of the following symptoms can occur with DOXIL: flushing, shortness of breath, facial swelling, headache, chills, chest pain, back pain, tightness in the chest and throat, fever, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, cyanosis, syncope, bronchospasm, asthma, apnea, and hypotension. The majority of infusion-related events occurred during the first infusion. Of 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with DOXIL in Trial 4, 7% of patients experienced acute infusion-related reactions resulting in dose interruption. All occurred during cycle 1 and none during subsequent cycles. Across multiple studies of DOXIL monotherapy including this and other studies enrolling 760 patients with various solid tumors, 11% of patients had infusion-related reactions. Ensure that medications to treat infusion-related reactions and cardiopulmonary resuscitative equipment are available for immediate use prior to initiation of DOXIL. Initiate DOXIL infusions at a rate of 1 mg/min and increase rate as tolerated [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. In the event of an infusion-related reaction, temporarily stop the drug until resolution then resume at a reduced infusion rate. Discontinue DOXIL infusion for serious or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. 5.3 Hand-Foot Syndrome (HFS) In Trial 4, the incidence of HFS was 51% of patients in the DOXIL arm and 0.9% of patients in the topotecan arm, including 24% Grade 3 or 4 cases of HFS in DOXIL-treated patients and no Grade 3 or 4 cases in topotecan-treated patients. HFS or other skin toxicity required discontinuation of DOXIL in 4.2% of patients. HFS was generally observed after 2 or 3 cycles of treatment but may occur earlier. Delay DOXIL for the first episode of Grade 2 or greater HFS [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Discontinue DOXIL if HFS is severe and debilitating. 5.4 Secondary Oral Neoplasms Secondary oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinoma, have been reported from post-marketing experience in patients with long-term (more than one year) exposure to DOXIL. These malignancies were diagnosed both during treatment with DOXIL and up to 6 years after the last dose. Examine patients at regular intervals for the presence of oral ulceration or with any oral discomfort that may be indicative of secondary oral cancer. The altered pharmacokinetics and preferential tissue distribution of liposomal doxorubicin that contributes to enhanced skin toxicity and mucositis compared to free doxorubicin may play a role in the development of oral secondary malignancies with long-term use. 5.5 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on animal data, DOXIL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. At doses approximately 0.12 times the recommended clinical dose, DOXIL was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with DOXIL [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.3)]."

        "Drug Interactions Doxorubicin is extensively metabolized by the liver. Changes in hepatic function induced by concomitant therapies may affect doxorubicin metabolism, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, and/or toxicity. Toxicities associated with doxorubicin, especially hematologic and gastrointestinal events, may be increased when doxorubicin is used in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Paclitaxel: There have been a number of reports in the literature that describe an increase in cardiotoxicity when doxorubicin is co-administered with paclitaxel. Two published studies report that initial administration of paclitaxel infused over 24 hours followed by doxorubicin administered over 48 hours resulted in a significant decrease in doxorubicin clearance with more profound neutropenic and stomatitis episodes than the reverse sequence of administration. Progesterone: In a published study, progesterone was given intravenously to patients with advanced malignancies (ECOG PS < 2) at high doses (up to 10 g over 24 hours) concomitantly with a fixed doxorubicin dose (60 mg/m2) via bolus injection. Enhanced doxorubicin induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed Verapamil: A study of the effects of verapamil on the acute toxicity of doxorubicin in mice revealed higher initial peak concentrations of doxorubicin in the heart with a higher incidence and severity of degenerative changes in cardiac tissue resulting in a shorter survival. Cyclosporine: The addition of cyclosporine to doxorubicin may result in increases in AUC for both doxorubicin and doxorubicinol possibly due to a decrease in clearance of parent drug and a decrease in metabolism of doxorubicinol. Literature reports suggest that adding cyclosporine to doxorubicin results in more profound and prolonged hematologic toxicitythan doxorubicin alone. Coma and/or seizures have also been described. Dexrazoxane: In a clinical study of women with metastatic breast cancer, the concurrent use of the cardioprotectant, dexrazoxane, with the initiation of a regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) was associated with a lower tumor response rate. Later initiation of dexrazoxane (after administration of a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin had been given as a component of FAC) was not associated with a reduction in chemotherapy activity. Dexrazoxane is only indicated for use in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 and are continuing with doxorubicin therapy. Cytarabine: Necrotizing colitis manifested by typhlitis (cecal inflammation), bloody stools and severe and sometimes fatal infections have been associated with a combination of doxorubicin given by intravenous push daily for 3 days and cytarabine given by continuous infusion daily for 7 or more days. Sorafenib: In clinical studies, both an increase of 21% and 47%, and no change in the AUC of doxorubicin were observed with concomitant treatment with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Cyclophosphamide: The addition of cyclophosphamide to doxorubicin treatment does not affect exposure to doxorubicin, but may result in an increase in exposure to doxorubicinol, a metabolite. Doxorubicinol only has 5% of the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin. Concurrent treatment with doxorubicin has been reported to exacerbate cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Acute myeloid leukemia has been reported as a second malignancy after treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Literature reports have also described the following drug interactions: Phenobarbital increases the elimination of doxorubicin; phenytoin levels may be decreased by doxorubicin; streptozocin (Zanosar®) may inhibit hepatic metabolism of doxorubicin; saquinavir in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide increased mucosal toxicity in patients with HIV-associated non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; and administration of live vaccines to immunosuppressed patients including those undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy may be hazardous (see WARNINGS)"

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Dose limiting toxicities of therapy are myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. Other reactions reported are: Cardiotoxicity (See WARNINGS) Cutaneous Reversible complete alopecia occurs in most cases. Hyperpigmentation of nailbeds and dermal creases, primarily in pediatric patients, and onycholysis have been reported in a few cases. Radiation recall reaction has occurred with doxorubicin administration. Rash, itching, or photosensitivity may occur. Gastrointestinal Acute nausea and vomiting occurs frequently and may be severe. This may be alleviated by antiemetic therapy. Mucositis (stomatitis and esophagitis) may occur within 5 to 10 days of beginning therapy, and most patients recover from this adverse event within another 5 to 10 days. The effect may be severe leading to ulceration and represents a site of origin for severe infections. The dosage regimen consisting of administration of doxorubicin on three successive days results in greater incidence and severity of mucositis. Ulceration and necrosis of the colon, especially the cecum, may occur leading to bleeding or severe infections which can be fatal. This reaction has been reported in patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia treated with a 3-day course of doxorubicin combined with cytarabine. Anorexia, abdominal pain, dehydration, diarrhea, and hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa have been occasionally reported. Hematologic (See WARNINGS) Hypersensitivity Fever, chills, and urticaria have been reported occasionally. Anaphylaxis may occur. A case of apparent cross sensitivity to lincomycin has been reported. Neurological Peripheral neurotoxicity in the form of local-regional sensory and/or motor disturbances have been reported in patients treated intra-arterially with doxorubicin, mostly in combination with cisplatin. Animal studies have demonstrated seizures and coma in rodents and dogs treated with intra-carotid doxorubicin. Seizures and coma have been reported in patients treated with doxorubicin in combination with cisplatin or vincristine. Ocular Conjunctivitis, keratitis, and lacrimation occur rarely. Other Malaise/asthenia have been reported. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Early Breast Cancer Receiving Doxorubicin-Containing Adjuvant Therapy Safety data were collected from approximately 2300 women who participated in a randomized, open-label trial (NSABP B-15) evaluating the use of AC versus CMF in the treatment of early breast cancer involving axillary lymph nodes. In the safety analysis, the follow-up data from all patients receiving AC were combined (N=1492 evaluable patients) and compared with data from patients receiving conventional CMF (i.e., oral cyclophosphamide; N=739 evaluable patients).

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin hydrochloride with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P-gp (7.1). Do not administer doxorubicin hydrochloride in combination with trastuzumab due to increased risk of cardiac dysfunction (5.1, 7.2). 7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors, Inducers and P-gp Doxorubicin is a major substrate of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Clinically significant interactions have been reported with inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P-gp (e.g., verapamil), resulting in increased concentration and clinical effect of doxorubicin. Inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John's Wort) and P-gp inducers may decrease the concentration of doxorubicin. Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin hydrochloride with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or P-gp. 7.2 Trastuzumab Concurrent use of trastuzumab and doxorubicin hydrochloride results in an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Avoid concurrent administration of doxorubicin and trastuzumab. The appropriate interval for administering doxorubicin following trastuzumab therapy has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.3 Paclitaxel Paclitaxel, when given prior to doxorubicin hydrochloride, increases the plasma-concentrations of doxorubicin and its metabolites. Administer doxorubicin hydrochloride prior to paclitaxel if used concomitantly. 7.4 Dexrazoxane Do not administer dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant at the initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride containing chemotherapy regimens. In a randomized trial in women with metastatic breast cancer, initiation of dexrazoxane with doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy resulted in a significantly lower tumor response rate (48% vs. 63%; p=0.007) and shorter time to progression than in women who received doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy alone. 7.5 6-Mercaptopurine Doxorubicin hydrochloride may potentiate 6-mercaptopurine-induced hepatotoxicity. In 11 patients with refractory leukemia treated with 6-mercaptopurine (500 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days per cycle every 2-3 weeks) and doxorubicin hydrochloride (50 mg/m2 intravenous once per cycle every 2-3 weeks) alone or with vincristine and prednisone, all developed hepatic dysfunction manifested by elevations of total serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Radiation-induced toxicity can be increased by the administration of doxorubicin hydrochloride. Radiation recall can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin hydrochloride after prior radiation therapy (5.7). Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.8). 5.1 Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmias Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure. The risk of cardiomyopathy is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure. Include prior doses of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones in calculations of total cumulative dosage for doxorubicin hydrochloride. Cardiomyopathy may develop during treatment or up to several years after completion of treatment and can include decrease in LVEF and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). The probability of developing cardiomyopathy is estimated to be 1 to 2% at a total cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin hydrochloride, 3 to 5% at a dose of 400 mg/m2, 5 to 8% at a dose of 450 mg/m2, and 6 to 20% at a dose of 500 mg/m2, when doxorubicin hydrochloride is administered every 3 weeks. There is an additive or potentially synergistic increase in the risk of cardiomyopathy in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum or concomitant therapy with other known cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab. Pericarditis and myocarditis have also been reported during or following doxorubicin hydrochloride treatment. Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g., MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity. Increase the frequency of assessments as the cumulative dose exceeds 300 mg/m2. Use the same method of assessment of LVEF at all time points [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Consider the use of dexrazoxane to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy due to doxorubicin hydrochloride administration in patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin hydrochloride dose of 300 mg/m2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin hydrochloride. Arrhythmias Doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in arrhythmias, including life-threatening arrhythmias, during or within a few hours after doxorubicin hydrochloride administration and at any time point during treatment. Tachyarrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia, as well as bradycardia may occur. Electrocardiographic changes including non-specific ST-T wave changes, atrioventricular and bundle-branch block can also occur. These electrocardiographic changes may be transient and self-limited and may not require dose-modifications of doxorubicin hydrochloride. 5.2 Secondary Malignancies The risk of developing secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is increased following treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride. Cumulative incidences ranged from 0.2% at five years to 1.5% at 10 years in two separate trials involving the adjuvant treatment of women with breast cancer. These leukemias generally occur within 1 to 3 years of treatment. 5.3 Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis Extravasation of doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulceration, and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting. When given via a peripheral venous line, infuse doxorubicin over 10 minutes or less to minimize the risk of thrombosis or perivenous extravasation. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately terminate the injection or infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Extravasation may be present in patients who do not experience a stinging or burning sensation or when blood return is present on aspiration of the infusion needle. If extravasation is suspected, apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days. If appropriate, administer dexrazoxane at the site of extravasation as soon as possible and within the first 6 hours after extravasation. 5.4 Severe Myelosuppression Doxorubicin hydrochloride can cause myelosuppression. In Study 1, the incidence of severe myelosuppression was: grade 4 leukopenia (0.3%), grade 3 leukopenia (3%), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (0.1%). A dose-dependent, reversible neutropenia is the predominant manifestation of hematologic toxicity from doxorubicin hydrochloride. When doxorubicin hydrochloride is administered every 21 days, the neutrophil count reaches its nadir 10 to 14 days after administration with recovery usually occurring by the 21st day. Obtain baseline assessment of blood counts and carefully monitor patients during treatment for possible clinical complications due to myelosuppression. 5.5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The clearance of doxorubicin is decreased in patients with elevated serum bilirubin with an increased risk of toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce the dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with serum bilirubin levels of 1.2 to 5 mg/dL [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Doxorubicin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as Child Pugh Class C or serum bilirubin level greater than 5 mg/dL) [see Contraindications (4)]. Obtain liver tests including SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during doxorubicin hydrochloride therapy. 5.6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Doxorubicin hydrochloride may induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Evaluate blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine after initial treatment. Hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia may minimize potential complications of tumor lysis syndrome. 5.7 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Doxorubicin hydrochloride can increase radiation-induced toxicity to the myocardium, mucosa, skin, and liver. Radiation recall, including but not limited to cutaneous and pulmonary toxicity, can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin hydrochloride after prior radiation therapy. 5.8 Embryofetal Toxicity Doxorubicin hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses lower than the recommended human dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride and for 6 months after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking doxorubicin hydrochloride [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin hydrochloride with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P-gp (7.1). Do not administer doxorubicin hydrochloride in combination with trastuzumab due to increased risk of cardiac dysfunction (5.1, 7.2). 7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors, Inducers and P-gp Doxorubicin is a major substrate of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Clinically significant interactions have been reported with inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P-gp (e.g., verapamil), resulting in increased concentration and clinical effect of doxorubicin. Inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John’s Wort) and P-gp inducers may decrease the concentration of doxorubicin. Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin hydrochloride with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or P-gp. 7.2 Trastuzumab Concurrent use of trastuzumab and doxorubicin hydrochloride results in an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Avoid concurrent administration of doxorubicin and trastuzumab. The appropriate interval for administering doxorubicin following trastuzumab therapy has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.3 Paclitaxel Paclitaxel, when given prior to doxorubicin hydrochloride, increases the plasma-concentrations of doxorubicin and its metabolites. Administer doxorubicin hydrochloride prior to paclitaxel if used concomitantly. 7.4 Dexrazoxane Do not administer dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant at the initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride­containing chemotherapy regimens. In a randomized trial in women with metastatic breast cancer, initiation of dexrazoxane with doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy resulted in a significantly lower tumor response rate (48% vs. 63%; p=0.007) and shorter time to progression than in women who received doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy alone. 7.5 6-Mercaptopurine Doxorubicin hydrochloride may potentiate 6-mercaptopurine-induced hepatotoxicity.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Radiation-induced toxicity can be increased by the administration of doxorubicin hydrochloride. Radiation recall can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin hydrochloride after prior radiation therapy (5.7). Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.8). 5.1 Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmias Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure. The risk of cardiomyopathy is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure. Include prior doses of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones in calculations of total cumulative dosage for doxorubicin hydrochloride. Cardiomyopathy may develop during treatment or up to several years after completion of treatment and can include decrease in LVEF and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). The probability of developing cardiomyopathy is estimated to be 1 to 2% at a total cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin hydrochloride, 3 to 5% at a dose of 400 mg/m2, 5 to 8% at a dose of 450 mg/m2, and 6 to 20% at a dose of 500 mg/m2, when doxorubicin hydrochloride is administered every 3 weeks. There is an additive or potentially synergistic increase in the risk of cardiomyopathy in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum or concomitant therapy with other known cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab. Pericarditis and myocarditis have also been reported during or following doxorubicin hydrochloride treatment. Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g., MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity. Increase the frequency of assessments as the cumulative dose exceeds 300 mg/m2. Use the same method of assessment of LVEF at all time points [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Consider the use of dexrazoxane to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy due to doxorubicin hydrochloride administration in patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin hydrochloride dose of 300 mg/m2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin hydrochloride. Arrhythmias Doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in arrhythmias, including life-threatening arrhythmias, during or within a few hours after doxorubicin hydrochloride administration and at any time point during treatment. Tachyarrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia, as well as bradycardia may occur. Electrocardiographic changes including non-specific ST-T wave changes, atrioventricular and bundle-branch block can also occur. These electrocardiographic changes may be transient and self-limited and may not require dose-modifications of doxorubicin hydrochloride. 5.2 Secondary Malignancies The risk of developing secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is increased following treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride. Cumulative incidences ranged from 0.2% at five years to 1.5% at 10 years in two separate trials involving the adjuvant treatment of women with breast cancer. These leukemias generally occur within 1 to 3 years of treatment. 5.3 Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis Extravasation of doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulceration, and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting. When given via a peripheral venous line, infuse doxorubicin over 10 minutes or less to minimize the risk of thrombosis or perivenous extravasation. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately terminate the injection or infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Extravasation may be present in patients who do not experience a stinging or burning sensation or when blood return is present on aspiration of the infusion needle. If extravasation is suspected, apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days. If appropriate, administer dexrazoxane at the site of extravasation as soon as possible and within the first 6 hours after extravasation. 5.4 Severe Myelosuppression Doxorubicin hydrochloride can cause myelosuppression. In Study 1, the incidence of severe myelosuppression was: grade 4 leukopenia (0.3%), grade 3 leukopenia (3%), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (0.1%). A dose-dependent, reversible neutropenia is the predominant manifestation of hematologic toxicity from doxorubicin hydrochloride. When doxorubicin hydrochloride is administered every 21 days, the neutrophil count reaches its nadir 10 to 14 days after administration with recovery usually occurring by the 21st day. Obtain baseline assessment of blood counts and carefully monitor patients during treatment for possible clinical complications due to myelosuppression. 5.5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The clearance of doxorubicin is decreased in patients with elevated serum bilirubin with an increased risk of toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce the dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with serum bilirubin levels of 1.2 to 5 mg/dL [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Doxorubicin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as Child Pugh Class C or serum bilirubin level greater than 5 mg/dL) [see Contraindications (4)]. Obtain liver tests including SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during doxorubicin hydrochloride therapy. 5.6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Doxorubicin hydrochloride may induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Evaluate blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine after initial treatment. Hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia may minimize potential complications of tumor lysis syndrome. 5.7 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Doxorubicin hydrochloride can increase radiation-induced toxicity to the myocardium, mucosa, skin, and liver. Radiation recall, including but not limited to cutaneous and pulmonary toxicity, can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin hydrochloride after prior radiation therapy. 5.8 Embryofetal Toxicity Doxorubicin hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses lower than the recommended human dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride and for 6 months after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking doxorubicin hydrochloride [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.6)]."

        "Drug Interactions Doxorubicin is extensively metabolized by the liver. Changes in hepatic function induced by concomitant therapies may affect doxorubicin metabolism, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, and/or toxicity. Toxicities associated with doxorubicin, especially hematologic and gastrointestinal events, may be increased when doxorubicin is used in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Paclitaxel: There have been a number of reports in the literature that describe an increase in cardiotoxicity when doxorubicin is co-administered with paclitaxel. Two published studies report that initial administration of paclitaxel infused over 24 hours followed by doxorubicin administered over 48 hours resulted in a significant decrease in doxorubicin clearance with more profound neutropenic and stomatitis episodes than the reverse sequence of administration. Progesterone: In a published study, progesterone was given intravenously to patients with advanced malignancies (ECOG PS < 2) at high doses (up to 10 g over 24 hours) concomitantly with a fixed doxorubicin dose (60 mg/m2) via bolus injection. Enhanced doxorubicin-induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed. Verapamil: A study of the effects of verapamil on the acute toxicity of doxorubicin in mice revealed higher initial peak concentrations of doxorubicin in the heart with a higher incidence and severity of degenerative changes in cardiac tissue resulting in a shorter survival. Cyclosporine: The addition of cyclosporine to doxorubicin may result in increases in AUC for both doxorubicin and doxorubicinol possibly due to a decrease in clearance of parent drug and a decrease in metabolism of doxorubicinol. Literature reports suggest that adding cyclosporine to doxorubicin results in more profound and prolonged hematologic toxicity than doxorubicin alone. Coma and/or seizures have also been described. Dexrazoxane: In a clinical study of women with metastatic breast cancer, the concurrent use of the cardioprotectant, dexrazoxane, with the initiation of a regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) was associated with a lower tumor response rate. Later initiation of dexrazoxane (after administration of a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin had been given as a component of FAC) was not associated with a reduction in chemotherapy activity. Dexrazoxane is only indicated for use in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 and are continuing with doxorubicin therapy. Cytarabine: Necrotizing colitis manifested by typhlitis (cecal inflammation), bloody stools, and severe and sometimes fatal infections have been associated with a combination of doxorubicin given by intravenous push daily for 3 days and cytarabine given by continuous infusion daily for 7 or more days. Sorafenib: In clinical studies, both an increase of 21% and 47%, and no change in the AUC of doxorubicin were observed with concomitant treatment with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Cyclophosphamide: The addition of cyclophosphamide to doxorubicin treatment does not affect exposure to doxorubicin, but may result in an increase in exposure to doxorubicinol, a metabolite. Doxorubicinol only has 5% of the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin. Concurrent treatment with doxorubicin has been reported to exacerbate cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Acute myeloid leukemia has been reported as a second malignancy after treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Literature reports have also described the following drug interactions: Phenobarbital increases the elimination of doxorubicin; phenytoin levels may be decreased by doxorubicin; streptozocin (Zanosar®) may inhibit hepatic metabolism of doxorubicin; saquinavir in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide increased mucosal toxicity in patients with HIV-associated non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; and administration of live vaccines to immunosuppressed patients including those undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy may be hazardous (see WARNINGS ). Laboratory Tests Initial treatment with doxorubicin requires observation of the patient and periodic monitoring of complete blood counts, hepatic function tests, and left ventricular ejection fraction (see WARNINGS ). Abnormalities of hepatic function tests may occur. Like other cytotoxic drugs, doxorubicin may induce “tumor-lysis syndrome” and hyperuricemia in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine should be evaluated after initial treatment. Hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia may minimize potential complications of tumor-lysis syndrome."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Dose limiting toxicities of therapy are myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. Other reactions reported are: Cardiotoxicity (See WARNINGS .) Cutaneous -- Reversible complete alopecia occurs in most cases. Hyperpigmentation of nailbeds and dermal creases, primarily in pediatric patients, and onycholysis have been reported in a few cases. Radiation recall reaction has occurred with doxorubicin administration. Rash, itching, or photosensitivity may occur. Gastrointestinal -- Acute nausea and vomiting occurs frequently and may be severe. This may be alleviated by antiemetic therapy. Mucositis (stomatitis and esophagitis) may occur within 5 to 10 days of beginning therapy, and most patients recover from this adverse event within another 5 to 10 days. The effect may be severe, leading to ulceration and represents a site of origin for severe infections. The dosage regimen consisting of administration of doxorubicin on three successive days results in greater incidence and severity of mucositis. Ulceration and necrosis of the colon, especially the cecum, may occur leading to bleeding or severe infections which can be fatal. This reaction has been reported in patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia treated with a 3-day course of doxorubicin combined with cytarabine. Anorexia, abdominal pain, dehydration, diarrhea, and hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa have been occasionally reported. Hematologic -- (See WARNINGS .) Hypersensitivity -- Fever, chills, and urticaria have been reported occasionally. Anaphylaxis may occur. A case of apparent cross sensitivity to lincomycin has been reported. Neurological -- Peripheral neurotoxicity in the form of local-regional sensory and/or motor disturbances have been reported in patients treated intra-arterially with doxorubicin, mostly in combination with cisplatin. Animal studies have demonstrated seizures and coma in rodents and dogs treated with intra-carotid doxorubicin. Seizures and coma have been reported in patients treated with doxorubicin in combination with cisplatin or vincristine. Ocular -- Conjunctivitis, keratitis, and lacrimation occur rarely. Other -- Malaise/asthenia have been reported. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Early Breast Cancer Receiving Doxorubicin-Containing Adjuvant Therapy: Safety data were collected from approximately 2300 women who participated ina randomized, open-label trial (NSABP B-15) evaluating the use of AC versus CMF in the treatmentof early breast cancer involving axillary lymph nodes.

Cardiomyopathy may develop during treatment or up to several years after completion of treatment and can include decrease in LVEF and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). The probability of developing cardiomyopathy is estimated to be 1 to 2% at a total cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin HCl, 3 to 5% at a dose of 400 mg/m2, 5 to 8% at a dose of 450 mg/m2, and 6 to 20% at a dose of 500 mg/m2, when doxorubicin HCl is administered every 3 weeks. There is an additive or potentially synergistic increase in the risk of cardiomyopathy in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum or concomitant therapy with other known cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab. Pericarditis and myocarditis have also been reported during or following doxorubicin HCl treatment. Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g., MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of doxorubicin HCl, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity. Increase the frequency of assessments as the cumulative dose exceeds 300 mg/m2. Use the same method of assessment of LVEF at all time points [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Consider the use of dexrazoxane to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy due to doxorubicin HCl administration in patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin HCl dose of 300 mg/m2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin HCl. Arrhythmias Doxorubicin HCl can result in arrhythmias, including life-threatening arrhythmias, during or within a few hours after doxorubicin HCl administration and at any time point during treatment. Tachyarrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia, as well as bradycardia may occur. Electrocardiographic changes including non-specific ST-T wave changes, atrioventricular and bundle-branch block can also occur. These electrocardiographic changes may be transient and self-limited and may not require dose-modifications of doxorubicin HCl. 5.2 Secondary Malignancies The risk of developing secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is increased following treatment with doxorubicin HCl. Cumulative incidences ranged from 0.2% at five years to 1.5% at 10 years in two separate trials involving the adjuvant treatment of women with breast cancer. These leukemias generally occur within 1 to 3 years of treatment. 5.3 Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis Extravasation of doxorubicin HCl can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulceration, and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting. When given via a peripheral venous line, infuse doxorubicin over 10 minutes or less to minimize the risk of thrombosis or perivenous extravasation. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately terminate the injection or infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Extravasation may be present in patients who do not experience a stinging or burning sensation or when blood return is present on aspiration of the infusion needle. If extravasation is suspected, apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days. If appropriate, administer dexrazoxane at the site of extravasation as soon as possible and within the first 6 hours after extravasation. 5.4 Severe Myelosuppression Doxorubicin HCl can cause myelosuppression. In Study 1, the incidence of severe myelosuppression was: grade 4 leukopenia (0.3%), grade 3 leukopenia (3%), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (0.1%). A dose-dependent, reversible neutropenia is the predominant manifestation of hematologic toxicity from doxorubicin HCl. When doxorubicin HCl is administered every 21 days, the neutrophil count reaches its nadir 10 to 14 days after administration with recovery usually occurring by the 21st day. Obtain baseline assessment of blood counts and carefully monitor patients during treatment for possible clinical complications due to myelosuppression. 5.5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The clearance of doxorubicin is decreased in patients with elevated serum bilirubin with an increased risk of toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce the dose of doxorubicin HCl in patients with serum bilirubin levels of 1.2 to 5.0 mg/dL [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Doxorubicin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as Child Pugh Class C or serum bilirubin level greater than 5 mg/dL) [see Contraindications (4)]. Obtain liver tests including SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during doxorubicin HCl therapy. 5.6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Doxorubicin HCl may induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Evaluate blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine after initial treatment. Hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia may minimize potential complications of tumor lysis syndrome. 5.7 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Doxorubicin HCl can increase radiation-induced toxicity to the myocardium, mucosa, skin, and liver. Radiation recall, including but not limited to cutaneous and pulmonary toxicity, can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin HCl after prior radiation therapy. 5.8 Embryofetal Toxicity Doxorubicin HCl can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Doxorubicin HCl was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses lower than the recommended human dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with doxorubicin HCl and for 6 months after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking doxorubicin HCl [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.6)]."

        "Drug Interactions Doxorubicin is extensively metabolized by the liver. Changes in hepatic function induced by concomitant therapies may affect doxorubicin metabolism, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, and/or toxicity. Toxicities associated with doxorubicin, especially hematologic and gastrointestinal events, may be increased when doxorubicin is used in combination with other cytotoxic drugs. Paclitaxel There have been a number of reports in the literature that describe an increase in cardiotoxicity when doxorubicin is co-administered with paclitaxel. Two published studies report that initial administration of paclitaxel infused over 24 hours followed by doxorubicin administered over 48 hours resulted in a significant decrease in doxorubicin clearance with more profound neutropenic and stomatitis episodes than the reverse sequence of administration. Progesterone In a published study, progesterone was given intravenously to patients with advanced malignancies (ECOG PS < 2) at high doses (up to 10 g over 24 hours) concomitantly with a fixed doxorubicin dose (60 mg/m2) via bolus injection. Enhanced doxorubicin-induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed. Verapamil A study of the effects of verapamil on the acute toxicity of doxorubicin in mice revealed higher initial peak concentrations of doxorubicin in the heart with a higher incidence and severity of degenerative changes in cardiac tissue resulting in a shorter survival. Cyclosporine The addition of cyclosporine to doxorubicin may result in increases in AUC for both doxorubicin and doxorubicinol possibly due to a decrease in clearance of parent drug and a decrease in metabolism of doxorubicinol. Literature reports suggest that adding cyclosporine to doxorubicin results in more profound and prolonged hematologic toxicity than doxorubicin alone. Coma and/or seizures have also been described. Dexrazoxane In a clinical study of women with metastatic breast cancer, the concurrent use of the cardioprotectant, dexrazoxane, with the initiation of a regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) was associated with a lower tumor response rate. Later initiation of dexrazoxane (after administration of a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin had been given as a component of FAC) was not associated with a reduction in chemotherapy activity. Dexrazoxane is only indicated for use in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 and are continuing with doxorubicin therapy. Cytarabine Necrotizing colitis manifested by typhlitis (cecal inflammation), bloody stools, and severe and sometimes fatal infections have been associated with a combination of doxorubicin given by intravenous push daily for 3 days and cytarabine given by continuous infusion daily for 7 or more days. Sorafenib In clinical studies, both an increase of 21% and 47%, and no change in the AUC of doxorubicin were observed with concomitant treatment with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Cyclophosphamide The addition of cyclophosphamide to doxorubicin treatment does not affect exposure to doxorubicin, but may result in an increase in exposure to doxorubicinol, a metabolite. Doxorubicinol only has 5% of the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin. Concurrent treatment with doxorubicin has been reported to exacerbate cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Acute myeloid leukemia has been reported as a second malignancy after treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Literature reports have also described the following drug interactions Phenobarbital increases the elimination of doxorubicin; phenytoin levels may be decreased by doxorubicin; streptozocin (Zanosar®) may inhibit hepatic metabolism of doxorubicin; saquinavir in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide increased mucosal toxicity in patients with HIV-associated non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; and administration of live vaccines to immunosuppressed patients including those undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy may be hazardous (see WARNINGS)."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Dose limiting toxicities of therapy are myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. Other reactions reported are: Cardiotoxicity (see WARNINGS). Cutaneous Reversible complete alopecia occurs in most cases. Hyperpigmentation of nailbeds and dermal creases, primarily in pediatric patients, and onycholysis have been reported in a few cases. Radiation recall reaction has occurred with doxorubicin administration. Rash, itching, or photosensitivity may occur. Gastrointestinal Acute nausea and vomiting occurs frequently and may be severe. This may be alleviated by antiemetic therapy. Mucositis (stomatitis and esophagitis) may occur within 5 to 10 days of beginning therapy, and most patients recover from this adverse event within another 5 to 10 days. The effect may be severe, leading to ulceration and represents a site of origin for severe infections. The dosage regimen consisting of administration of doxorubicin on three successive days results in greater incidence and severity of mucositis. Ulceration and necrosis of the colon, especially the cecum, may occur, leading to bleeding or severe infections which can be fatal. This reaction has been reported in patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia treated with a 3-day course of doxorubicin combined with cytarabine. Anorexia, abdominal pain, dehydration, diarrhea, and hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa have been occasionally reported. Hematologic (see WARNINGS). Hypersensitivity Fever, chills, and urticaria have been reported occasionally. Anaphylaxis may occur. A case of apparent cross sensitivity to lincomycin has been reported. Neurological Peripheral neurotoxicity in the form of local-regional sensory and/or motor disturbances have been reported in patients treated intra-arterially with doxorubicin, mostly in combination with cisplatin. Animal studies have demonstrated seizures and coma in rodents and dogs treated with intra-carotid doxorubicin. Seizures and coma have been reported in patients treated with doxorubicin in combination with cisplatin or vincristine. Ocular Conjunctivitis, keratitis, and lacrimation occur rarely. Other Malaise/asthenia have been reported. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Early Breast Cancer Receiving Doxorubicin-Containing Adjuvant Therapy Safety data were collected from approximately 2300 women who participated in a randomized, open-label trial (NSABP B-15) evaluating the use of AC versus CMF in the treatment of early breast cancer involving axillary lymph nodes. In the safety analysis, the follow-up data from all patients receiving AC were combined (N=1492 evaluable patients) and compared with data from patients receiving conventional CMF (i.e., oral cyclophosphamide; N=739 evaluable patients).

        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin hydrochloride with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P-gp (7.1). Do not administer doxorubicin hydrochloride in combination with trastuzumab due to increased risk of cardiac dysfunction (5.1, 7.2). 7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors, Inducers and P-gp Doxorubicin is a major substrate of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Clinically significant interactions have been reported with inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or P-gp (e.g., verapamil), resulting in increased concentration and clinical effect of doxorubicin. Inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, St. John's Wort) and P-gp inducers may decrease the concentration of doxorubicin. Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin hydrochloride with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or P-gp. 7.2 Trastuzumab Concurrent use of trastuzumab and doxorubicin hydrochloride results in an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Avoid concurrent administration of doxorubicin and trastuzumab. The appropriate interval for administering doxorubicin following trastuzumab therapy has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.3 Paclitaxel Paclitaxel, when given prior to doxorubicin hydrochloride, increases the plasma-concentrations of doxorubicin and its metabolites. Administer doxorubicin hydrochloride prior to paclitaxel if used concomitantly. 7.4 Dexrazoxane Do not administer dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant at the initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride containing chemotherapy regimens. In a randomized trial in women with metastatic breast cancer, initiation of dexrazoxane with doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy resulted in a significantly lower tumor response rate (48% vs. 63%; p=0.007) and shorter time to progression than in women who received doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy alone. 7.5 6-Mercaptopurine Doxorubicin hydrochloride may potentiate 6-mercaptopurine-induced hepatotoxicity. In 11 patients with refractory leukemia treated with 6-mercaptopurine (500 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days per cycle every 2 to 3 weeks) and doxorubicin hydrochloride (50 mg/m2 intravenous once per cycle every 2 to 3 weeks) alone or with vincristine and prednisone, all developed hepatic dysfunction manifested by elevations of total serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Radiation-induced toxicity can be increased by the administration of doxorubicin hydrochloride. Radiation recall can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin hydrochloride after prior radiation therapy (5.7). Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus (5.8). 5.1 Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmias Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure. The risk of cardiomyopathy is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure. Include prior doses of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones in calculations of total cumulative dosage for doxorubicin hydrochloride. Cardiomyopathy may develop during treatment or up to several years after completion of treatment and can include decrease in LVEF and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). The probability of developing cardiomyopathy is estimated to be 1 to 2% at a total cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin hydrochloride, 3 to 5% at a dose of 400 mg/m2, 5 to 8% at a dose of 450 mg/m2, and 6 to 20% at a dose of 500 mg/m2, when doxorubicin hydrochloride is administered every 3 weeks. There is an additive or potentially synergistic increase in the risk of cardiomyopathy in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum or concomitant therapy with other known cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab. Pericarditis and myocarditis have also been reported during or following doxorubicin hydrochloride treatment. Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g., MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity. Increase the frequency of assessments as the cumulative dose exceeds 300 mg/m2. Use the same method of assessment of LVEF at all time points [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Consider the use of dexrazoxane to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy due to doxorubicin hydrochloride administration in patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin hydrochloride dose of 300 mg/m2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin hydrochloride. Arrhythmias Doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in arrhythmias, including life-threatening arrhythmias, during or within a few hours after doxorubicin hydrochloride administration and at any time point during treatment. Tachyarrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia, as well as bradycardia may occur. Electrocardiographic changes including non-specific ST-T wave changes, atrioventricular and bundle-branch block can also occur. These electrocardiographic changes may be transient and self-limited and may not require dose-modifications of doxorubicin hydrochloride. 5.2 Secondary Malignancies The risk of developing secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is increased following treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride. Cumulative incidences ranged from 0.2% at five years to 1.5% at 10 years in two separate trials involving the adjuvant treatment of women with breast cancer. These leukemias generally occur within 1 to 3 years of treatment. 5.3 Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis Extravasation of doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulceration, and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting. When given via a peripheral venous line, infuse doxorubicin over 10 minutes or less to minimize the risk of thrombosis or perivenous extravasation. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately terminate the injection or infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Extravasation may be present in patients who do not experience a stinging or burning sensation or when blood return is present on aspiration of the infusion needle. If extravasation is suspected, apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days. If appropriate, administer dexrazoxane at the site of extravasation as soon as possible and within the first 6 hours after extravasation. 5.4 Severe Myelosuppression Doxorubicin hydrochloride can cause myelosuppression. In Study 1, the incidence of severe myelosuppression was: grade 4 leukopenia (0.3%), grade 3 leukopenia (3%), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (0.1%). A dose-dependent, reversible neutropenia is the predominant manifestation of hematologic toxicity from doxorubicin hydrochloride. When doxorubicin hydrochloride is administered every 21 days, the neutrophil count reaches its nadir 10 to 14 days after administration with recovery usually occurring by the 21st day. Obtain baseline assessment of blood counts and carefully monitor patients during treatment for possible clinical complications due to myelosuppression. 5.5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The clearance of doxorubicin is decreased in patients with elevated serum bilirubin with an increased risk of toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Reduce the dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with serum bilirubin levels of 1.2 to 5 mg/dL [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Doxorubicin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as Child Pugh Class C or serum bilirubin level greater than 5 mg/dL) [see Contraindications (4)]. Obtain liver tests including SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during doxorubicin hydrochloride therapy. 5.6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Doxorubicin hydrochloride may induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Evaluate blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine after initial treatment. Hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia may minimize potential complications of tumor lysis syndrome. 5.7 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Doxorubicin hydrochloride can increase radiation-induced toxicity to the myocardium, mucosa, skin, and liver. Radiation recall, including but not limited to cutaneous and pulmonary toxicity, can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin hydrochloride after prior radiation therapy. 5.8 Embryofetal Toxicity Doxorubicin hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Doxorubicin hydrochloride was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses lower than the recommended human dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride and for 6 months after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking doxorubicin hydrochloride [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.6)]."

The safety data reflect exposure to doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in 1310 patients including: 239 patients with ovarian cancer, 753 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, and 318 patients with multiple myeloma. The following tables present adverse reactions from clinical trials of single-agent doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in ovarian cancer and AIDS-Related Kaposi’s sarcoma. Patients With Ovarian Cancer The safety data described below are from Trial 4, which included 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection 50 mg/m2 once every 4 weeks for a minimum of four courses in a randomized, multicenter, open-label study. In this trial, patients received doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for a median number of 3.2 months (range 1 day to 25.8 months). The median age of the patients is 60 years (range 27 to 87), with 91% Caucasian, 6% Black, and 3% Hispanic or Other. Table 3 presents the hematologic adverse reactions from Trial 4.

Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma The safety data described is based on the experience reported in 753 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) enrolled in four open-label, uncontrolled trials of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection administered at doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg/m2 every 2 to 3 weeks. Demographics of the population were: median age 38.7 years (range 24 to 70)); 99% male; 88% Caucasian, 6% Hispanic, 4% Black, and 2% Asian/other/unknown. The majority of patients were treated with 20 mg/m2 of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection every 2 to 3 weeks with a median exposure of 4.2 months (range 1 day to 26.6 months). The median cumulative dose was 120 mg/m2 (range 3.3 to 798.6 mg/m2); 3% received cumulative doses of greater than 450 mg/m2. Disease characteristics were: 61% poor risk for KS tumor burden, 91% poor risk for immune system, and 47% poor risk for systemic illness; 36% were poor risk for all three categories; median CD4 count 21 cells/mm3 (51% less than 50 cells/mm3); mean absolute neutrophil count at study entry approximately 3,000 cells/mm3. Of the 693 patients with concomitant medication information, 59% were on one or more antiretroviral medications [35% zidovudine (AZT), 21% didanosine (ddI), 16% zalcitabine (ddC), and 10% stavudine (D4T)]; 85% received PCP prophylaxis (54% sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim); 85% received antifungal medications (76% fluconazole); 72% received antivirals (56% acyclovir, 29% ganciclovir, and 16% foscarnet) and 48% patients received colony-stimulating factors (sargramostim/filgrastim) during their course of treatment. Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5% of patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and included myelosuppression, cardiac adverse reactions, infusion-related reactions, toxoplasmosis, HFS, pneumonia, cough/dyspnea, fatigue, optic neuritis, progression of a non-KS tumor, allergy to penicillin, and unspecified reasons. Tables 5 and 6 summarize adverse reactions reported in patients treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in a pooled analysis of the four trials.

Patients With Multiple Myeloma The safety data described are from 318 patients treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection (30 mg/m2) administered on day 4 following bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 i.v. bolus on days 1, 4, 8 and 11) every 3 weeks, in a randomized, open-label, multicenter study (Trial 6). In this trial, patients in the doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection + bortezomib combination group were treated for a median number of 4.5 months (range 21 days to 13.5 months). The population was 28 to 85 years of age (median age 61), 58% male, 90% Caucasian, 6% Black, and 4% Asian and Other. Table 7 lists adverse reactions reported in 10% or more of patients treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in combination with bortezomib for multiple myeloma.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hand-Foot Syndrome may occur. Dose modification or discontinuation may be required (5.3) Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus. Use effective contraception (5.5, 8.1, 8.3) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure. The risk of cardiomyopathy with doxorubicin hydrochloride is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure. The relationship between cumulative doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection dose and the risk of cardiac toxicity has not been determined. In a clinical study in 250 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection, the risk of cardiotoxicity was 11% when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450 to 550 mg/m2. Cardiotoxicity was defined as >20% decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline where LVEF remained in the normal range or a >10% decrease in LVEF from baseline where LVEF was less than the institutional lower limit of normal. Two percent of patients developed signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure without documented evidence of cardiotoxicity. Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g. MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity. Administer doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease only when the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions Serious and sometimes life-threatening infusion-related reactions characterized by one or more of the following symptoms can occur with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection: flushing, shortness of breath, facial swelling, headache, chills, chest pain, back pain, tightness in the chest and throat, fever, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, cyanosis, syncope, bronchospasm, asthma, apnea, and hypotension. The majority of infusion-related events occurred during the first infusion. Of 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in Trial 4, 7% of patients experienced acute infusion-related reactions resulting in dose interruption. All occurred during cycle 1 and none during subsequent cycles. Across multiple studies of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection monotherapy including this and other studies enrolling 760 patients with various solid tumors, 11% of patients had infusion-related reactions. Ensure that medications to treat infusion-related reactions and cardiopulmonary resuscitative equipment are available for immediate use prior to initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection. Initiate doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection infusions at a rate of 1 mg/min and increase rate as tolerated [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. In the event of an infusion-related reaction, temporarily stop the drug until resolution then resume at a reduced infusion rate. Discontinue doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection infusion for serious or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. 5.3 Hand-Foot Syndrome(HFS) In Trial 4, the incidence of HFS was 51% of patients in the doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection arm and 0.9% of patients in the topotecan arm, including 24% Grade 3 or 4 cases of HFS in doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection-treated patients and no Grade 3 or 4 cases in topotecan-treated patients. HFS or other skin toxicity required discontinuation of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in 4.2% of patients. HFS was generally observed after 2 or 3 cycles of treatment but may occur earlier. Delay doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for the first episode of Grade 2 or greater HFS [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Discontinue doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection if HFS is severe and debilitating. 5.4 Secondary Oral Neoplasms Secondary oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinoma, have been reported from postmarketing experience in patients with long-term (more than one year) exposure to doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection. These malignancies were diagnosed both during treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection and up to 6 years after the last dose. Examine patients at regular intervals for the presence of oral ulceration or with any oral discomfort that may be indicative of secondary oral cancer. The altered pharmacokinetics and preferential tissue distribution of liposomal doxorubicin that contributes to enhanced skin toxicity and mucositis compared to free doxorubicin may play a role in the development of oral secondary malignancies with long-term use. 5.5 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on animal data, doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. At doses approximately 0.12 times the recommended clinical dose, doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.3)]."
