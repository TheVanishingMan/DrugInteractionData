        "Drug Interactions Since Cilostazol Tablets, USP is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, caution should be exercised when Cilostazol Tablets, USP is coadministered with inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole and erythromycin or inhibitors of CYP2C19 such as omeprazole. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that omeprazole and erythromycin significantly increased the systemic exposure of cilostazol and/or its major metabolites. Population pharmacokinetic studies showed higher concentrations of cilostazol among patients concurrently treated with diltiazem, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions ). Cilostazol Tablets, USP does not, however, appear to cause increased blood levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, as it had no effect on lovastatin, a drug with metabolism very sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition."

The increase in heart rate associated with cilostazol is approximately 5 bpm to 7 bpm. Patients with a history of ischemic heart disease may be at risk for exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. 5.2 Hematologic Adverse Reactions Cases of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis when cilostazol was not immediately discontinued have been reported. Agranulocytosis is reversible on discontinuation of cilostazol. Monitor platelets and white blood cell counts periodically. 5.3 Hemostatic Disorders or Active Pathologic Bleeding Cilostazol inhibits platelet aggregation in a reversible manner. Cilostazol has not been studied in patients with hemostatic disorders or active pathologic bleeding. Avoid use of cilostazol in these patients."

Risks of exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease (5.1) -Risks of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis-monitor platelets and white blood cell counts (5.2) -Avoid use in patients with hemostatic disorders or active pathologic bleeding (5.3) 5.1 Tachycardia Cilostazol may induce tachycardia, palpitation, tachyarrhythmia or hypotension. The increase in heart rate associated with cilostazol is approximately 5 to 7 bpm. Patients with a history of ischemic heart disease may be at risk for exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. 5.2 Hematologic Adverse Reactions Cases of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis when PLETAL was not immediately discontinued have been reported. Agranulocytosis is reversible on discontinuation of PLETAL. Monitor platelets and white blood cell counts periodically. 5.3 Hemostatic Disorders or Active Pathologic Bleeding PLETAL inhibits platelet aggregation in a reversible manner. PLETAL has not been studied in patients with hemostatic disorders or active pathologic bleeding. Avoid use of PLETAL in these patients."

Adverse reactions were assessed in eight placebo-controlled clinical trials involving patients exposed to either 50 mg or 100 mg twice daily cilostazol (n=1,301) or placebo (n=973), with a median treatment duration of 127 days for patients on cilostazol and 134 days for patients on placebo. The most frequent adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of therapy in more than 3% of patients treated with cilostazol was headache [50 mg twice daily (1.3%), 100 mg twice daily (3.5%) and placebo (0.3%)]. Other frequent causes of discontinuation included palpitation and diarrhea, both 1.1% for cilostazol (all doses) versus 0.1% for placebo.

        "Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions Cilostazol could have pharmacodynamic interactions with other inhibitors of platelet function and pharmacokinetic interactions because of effects of other drugs on its metabolism by CYP3A4 or CYP2C19. A reduced dose of cilostazol should be considered when taken concomitantly with CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors. Cilostazol does not appear to inhibit CYP3A4 (see Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions, Lovastatin ). Aspirin Short-term (<= 4 days) coadministration of aspirin with cilostazol increased the inhibition of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation by 22% to 37% when compared to either aspirin or cilostazol alone. Short-term (<= 4 days) coadministration of aspirin with cilostazol increased the inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation by 20% compared to cilostazol alone and by 48% compared to aspirin alone. However, short-term coadministration of aspirin with cilostazol had no clinically significant impact on PT, aPTT, or bleeding time compared to aspirin alone. Effects of long-term coadministration in the general population are unknown. In eight randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials, aspirin was coadministered with cilostazol to 201 patients. The most frequent doses and mean durations of aspirin therapy were 75 to 81 mg daily for 137 days (107 patients) and 325 mg daily for 54 days (85 patients). There was no apparent increase in incidence of hemorrhagic adverse effects in patients taking cilostazol and aspirin compared to patients taking placebo and equivalent doses of aspirin. Warfarin The cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of R-warfarin are CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C19, and in the metabolism of S-warfarin, CYP2C9. Cilostazol did not inhibit either the metabolism or the pharmacologic effects (PT, aPTT, bleeding time, or platelet aggregation) of R- and S-warfarin after a single 25 mg dose of warfarin. The effect of concomitant multiple dosing of warfarin and cilostazol on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of both drugs is unknown. Clopidogrel Multiple doses of clopidogrel do not significantly increase steady state plasma concentrations of cilostazol. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Strong inhibitors of CY3A4 A priming dose of ketoconazole 400 mg (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4), was given one day prior to coadministration of single doses of ketoconazole 400 mg and cilostazol 100 mg. This regimen increased cilostazol Cmax by 94% and AUC by 117%. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole, fluconazole, miconazole, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, nefazodone, and sertraline, would be expected to have a similar effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 Erythromycin and other macrolide antibiotics: Erythromycin is a moderately strong inhibitor of CYP3A4. Coadministration of erythromycin 500 mg q8h with a single dose of cilostazol 100 mg increased cilostazol Cmax by 47% and AUC by 73%. Inhibition of cilostazol metabolism by erythromycin increased the AUC of 4'-trans-hydroxy-cilostazol by 141%. Other macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin), but not all (e.g., azithromycin), would be expected to have a similar effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Diltiazem: Diltiazem 180 mg decreased the clearance of cilostazol by ~ 30%. Cilostazol Cmax increased ~ 30% and AUC increased ~ 40% (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Grapefruit Juice: Grapefruit juice increased the Cmax of cilostazol by ~ 50%, but had no effect on AUC. Inhibitors of CYP2C19 Omeprazole Coadministration of omeprazole did not significantly affect the metabolism of cilostazol, but the systemic exposure to 3,4-dehydro-cilostazol was increased by 69%, probably the result of omeprazole's potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Quinidine Concomitant administration of quinidine with a single dose of cilostazol 100 mg did not alter cilostazol pharmacokinetics. Lovastatin The concomitant administration of lovastatin with cilostazol decreases cilostazol Css, max and AUCτ by 15%. There is also a decrease, although nonsignificant, in cilostazol metabolite concentrations. Coadministration of cilostazol with lovastatin increases lovastatin and β-hydroxi lovastatin AUC approximately 70%. This is most likely clinically insignificant.",

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Risks of tachycardia, palpitation, tachyarrhythmia or hypotension. Risks of exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease (5.1) -Risks of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis--monitor platelets and white blood cell counts (5.2) -Avoid use in patients with hemostatic disorders or active pathologic bleeding (5.3) 5.1 Tachycardia Cilostazol may induce tachycardia, palpitation, tachyarrhythmia or hypotension. The increase in heart rate associated with cilostazol is approximately 5 to 7 bpm. Patients with a history of ischemic heart disease may be at risk for exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. 5.2 Hematologic Adverse Reactions Cases of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis when cilostazol was not immediately discontinued have been reported. Agranulocytosis is reversible on discontinuation of cilostazol. Monitor platelets and white blood cell counts periodically. 5.3 Hemostatic Disorders or Active Pathologic Bleeding Cilostazol inhibits platelet aggregation in a reversible manner. Cilostazol has not been studied in patients with hemostatic disorders or active pathologic bleeding. Avoid use of cilostazol in these patients."

Adverse reactions were assessed in eight placebo-controlled clinical trials involving patients exposed to either 50 or 100 mg twice daily cilostazol tablets (n=1301) or placebo (n=973), with a median treatment duration of 127 days for patients on cilostazol tablets and 134 days for patients on placebo. The most frequent adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of therapy in more than 3% of patients treated with cilostazol tablets was headache [50 mg twice daily (1.3%), 100 mg twice daily (3.5%) and placebo (0.3%)]. Other frequent causes of discontinuation included palpitation and diarrhea, both 1.1% for cilostazol tablets (all doses) versus 0.1% for placebo.

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks of tachycardia, palpitation, tachyarrhythmia or hypotension. Risks of exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease (5.1) Risks of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis-monitor platelets and white blood cell counts (5.2) Avoid use in patients with hemostatic disorders or active pathologic bleeding (5.3) 5.1 Tachycardia Cilostazol may induce tachycardia, palpitation, tachyarrhythmia or hypotension. The increase in heart rate associated with cilostazol is approximately 5 to 7 bpm. Patients with a history of ischemic heart disease may be at risk for exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. 5.2 Hematologic Adverse Reactions Cases of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis when cilostazol was not immediately discontinued have been reported. Agranulocytosis is reversible on discontinuation of cilostazol. Monitor platelets and white blood cell counts periodically. 5.3 Hemostatic Disorders or Active Pathologic Bleeding Cilostazol inhibits platelet aggregation in a reversible manner. Cilostazol has not been studied in patients with hemostatic disorders or active pathologic bleeding. Avoid use of cilostazol tablets in these patients."

        "Drug Interactions Since cilostazol is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, caution should be exercised when cilostazol is coadministered with inhibitors of CYP34 such as ketoconazole and erythromycin or inhibitors of CYP2C19 such as omeprazole. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that omeprazole and erythromycin significantly increased the systemic exposure of cilostazol and/or its major metabolites. Population pharmacokinetic studies showed higher concentrations of cilostazol among patients currently treated with diltiazem, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (see : ). Cilostazol does not, however, appear to cause increased blood levels of drug metabolized by CYP3A4, as it had no effect on lovastatin, a drug with metabolism very sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition.

        "Drug Interactions Since cilostazol is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes, caution should be exercised when cilostazol is coadministered with inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole and erythromycin or inhibitors of CYP2C19 such as omeprazole. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that omeprazole and erythromycin significantly increased the systemic exposure of cilostazol and/or its major metabolites. Population pharmacokinetic studies showed higher concentrations of cilostazol among patients concurrently treated with diltiazem, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions ). Cilostazol does not, however, appear to cause increased blood levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, as it had no effect on lovastatin, a drug with metabolism very sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse events were assessed in eight placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 2274 patients exposed to either 50 or 100 mg b.i.d. cilostazol (n=1301) or placebo (n=973), with a median treatment duration of 127 days for patients on cilostazol and 134 days for patients on placebo. The only adverse event resulting in discontinuation of therapy in >= 3% of patients treated with cilostazol 50 or 100 mg b.i.d. was headache, which occurred with an incidence of 1.3%, 3.5%, and 0.3% in patients treated with cilostazol 50 mg b.i.d., 100 mg b.i.d, or placebo, respectively. Other frequent causes of discontinuation included palpitation and diarrhea, both 1.1% for cilostazol (all doses) versus 0.1% for placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events, occurring in >= 2% of patients treated with cilostazol 50 or 100 mg b.i.d., are shown in the table (below).

        "Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions Cilostazol could have pharmacodynamic interactions with other inhibitors of platelet function and pharmacokinetic interactions because of effects of other drugs on its metabolism by CYP3A4 or CYP2C19. A reduced dose of cilostazol should be considered when taken concomitantly with CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors. Cilostazol does not appear to inhibit CYP3A4 (see Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug-Drug Interactions, Lovastatin ). Aspirin Short-term (<= 4 days) coadministration of aspirin with cilostazol increased the inhibition of ADP-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation by 22% to 37% when compared to either aspirin or cilostazol alone. Short-term (<= 4 days) coadministration of aspirin with cilostazol increased the inhibition of arachidonic acid-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation by 20% compared to cilostazol alone and by 48% compared to aspirin alone. However, short-term coadministration of aspirin with cilostazol had no clinically significant impact on PT, aPTT, or bleeding time compared to aspirin alone. Effects of long-term coadministration in the general population are unknown. In eight randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials, aspirin was coadministered with cilostazol to 201 patients. The most frequent doses and mean durations of aspirin therapy were 75 to 81 mg daily for 137 days (107 patients) and 325 mg daily for 54 days (85 patients). There was no apparent increase in incidence of hemorrhagic adverse effects in patients taking cilostazol and aspirin compared to patients taking placebo and equivalent doses of aspirin. Warfarin The cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of R-warfarin are CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C19, and in the metabolism of S-warfarin, CYP2C9. Cilostazol did not inhibit either the metabolism or the pharmacologic effects (PT, aPTT, bleeding time, or platelet aggregation) of R- and S-warfarin after a single 25 mg dose of warfarin. The effect of concomitant multiple dosing of warfarin and cilostazol on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of both drugs is unknown. Clopidogrel Multiple doses of clopidogrel do not significantly increase steady state plasma concentrations of cilostazol. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 A priming dose of ketoconazole 400 mg (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4), was given one day prior to coadministration of single doses of ketoconazole 400 mg and cilostazol 100 mg. This regimen increased cilostazol Cmax by 94% and AUC by 117%. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole, fluconazole, miconazole, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, nefazodone, and sertraline, would be expected to have a similar effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Erythromycin and other macrolide antibiotics: Erythromycin is a moderately strong inhibitor of CYP3A4. Coadministration of erythromycin 500 mg q 8h with a single dose of cilostazol 100 mg increased cilostazol Cmax by 47% and AUC by 73%. Inhibition of cilostazol metabolism by erythromycin increased the AUC of 4'-trans-hydroxy-cilostazol by 141%. Other macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin), but not all (e.g., azithromycin), would be expected to have a similar effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Diltiazem: Diltiazem 180 mg decreased the clearance of cilostazol by ~ 30%. Cilostazol Cmax increased ~ 30% and AUC increased ~ 40% (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Grapefruit Juice: Grapefruit juice increased the Cmax of cilostazol by ~ 50%, but had no effect on AUC. Inhibitors of CYP2C19 Omeprazole Coadministration of omeprazole did not significantly affect the metabolism of cilostazol, but the systemic exposure to 3,4-dehydro-cilostazol was increased by 69%, probably the result of omeprazole's potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Quinidine Concomitant administration of quinidine with a single dose of cilostazol 100 mg did not alter cilostazol pharmacokinetics. Lovastatin The concomitant administration of lovastatin with cilostazol decreases cilostazol Css, max and AUCτ by 15%. There is also a decrease, although nonsignificant, in cilostazol metabolite concentrations. Coadministration of cilostazol with lovastatin increases lovastatin and β-hydroxi lovastatin AUC approximately 70%. This is most likely clinically insignificant.",
