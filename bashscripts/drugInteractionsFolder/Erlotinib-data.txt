        "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS Erlotinib is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and inhibitors of CYP3A4 would be expected to increase exposure. Co-treatment with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increases erlotinib AUC by 2/3. When TARCEVA was co-administered with ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, the erlotinib exposure [AUC] and maximum concentration [Cmax] increased by 39% and 17% respectively. Caution should be used when administering or taking TARCEVA with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), voriconazole and grapefruit or grapefruit juice. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 )]. Pre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin for 7 days prior to TARCEVA decreased erlotinib AUC by about 2/3 to 4/5, which is equivalent to a dose of about 30 to 50 mg in NSCLC patients. In a separate study, treatment with rifampicin for 11 days, with co-administration of a single 450 mg dose of TARCEVA on day 8 resulted in a mean erlotinib exposure (AUC) that was 57.6% of that observed following a single 150 mg TARCEVA dose in the absence of rifampicin treatment [see Dose Modifications (2.3 )]. Use of alternative treatments lacking CYP3A4 inducing activity is strongly recommended. If an alternative treatment is unavailable, adjusting the starting dose should be considered. If the TARCEVA dose is adjusted upward, the dose will need to be reduced immediately to the indicated starting dose upon discontinuation of rifampicin or other inducers. Other CYP3A4 inducers include, but are not limited to, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John's Wort [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 )]. Cigarette smoking has been shown to reduce erlotinib AUC. Patients should be advised to stop smoking; however, if they continue to smoke, a cautious increase in the dose of TARCEVA may be considered, while monitoring the patient's safety. If the TARCEVA dose is adjusted upward, the dose should be reduced immediately to the indicated starting dose upon cessation of smoking. [see Dosage and Administration(2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology(12.3)]. Pretreatment and co-administration of TARCEVA decreased the AUC of CYP3A4 substrate, midazolam, by 24%. The mechanism is not clear. In a study, there were no significant effects of gemcitabine on the pharmacokinetics of erlotinib nor were there significant effects of erlotinib on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine. Drugs that alter the pH of the upper GI tract may alter the solubility of erlotinib and reduce its bioavailability. Co-administration of TARCEVA with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, decreased the erlotinib AUC by 46%. Increasing the dose of TARCEVA when co-administered with such agents is not likely to compensate for the loss of exposure. Since proton pump inhibitors affect pH of the upper GI tract for an extended period, separation of doses may not eliminate the interaction. The concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors with TARCEVA should be avoided if possible. The use of antacids may be considered in place of histamine 2 receptor blockers (H2 blockers) or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving TARCEVA. However, no clinical study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of antacids on erlotinib pharmacokinetics. If an antacid is necessary, the antacid dose and the TARCEVA dose should be separated by several hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase erlotinib plasma concentrations. (7) CYP3A4 inducers may decrease erlotinib plasma concentrations. (7) CYP1A2 inducers may decrease erlotinib plasma concentrations. (7) Erlotinib solubility is pH dependent. Drugs that alter the pH of the upper GI tract may alter the solubility of erlotinib and hence its absorption. (7) Cigarette smoking decreases erlotinib plasma concentrations (7)"

        "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Safety evaluation of TARCEVA is based on 856 cancer patients who received TARCEVA as monotherapy, 308 patients who received TARCEVA 100 or 150 mg plus gemcitabine, and 1228 patients who received TARCEVA concurrently with other chemotherapies. There have been reports of serious events, including fatalities, in patients receiving TARCEVA for treatment of NSCLC, pancreatic cancer or other advanced solid tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Dosage and Administration (2.3 )]. The most common adverse reactions (>50%) in NSCLC are rash, diarrhea, anorexia and fatigue. ( 6.1) The most common adverse reactions (>50%) in pancreatic cancer are fatigue, rash, nausea and anorexia. ( 6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-800-572-1932 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Adverse events, regardless of causality, that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with single-agent TARCEVA at 150 mg and at least 3% more often than in the placebo group in the randomized trial of patients with NSCLC are summarized by NCI-CTC (version 2.0) Grade in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving single-agent TARCEVA 150 mg were rash and diarrhea. Grade 3/4 rash and diarrhea occurred in 9% and 6%, respectively, in TARCEVA-treated patients. Rash and diarrhea each resulted in study discontinuation in 1% of TARCEVA-treated patients. Six percent and 1% of patients needed dose reduction for rash and diarrhea, respectively. The median time to onset of rash was 8 days, and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 12 days.

These elevations were mainly transient or associated with liver metastases. Grade 2 (>2.5 - 5.0 x ULN) ALT elevations occurred in 4% and <1% of TARCEVA and placebo treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 (>5.0 - 20.0 x ULN) elevations were not observed in TARCEVA-treated patients. TARCEVA dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if changes in liver function are severe. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] 6.2 Pancreatic Cancer Adverse events, regardless of causality, that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine in the randomized trial of patients with pancreatic cancer are summarized by NCI-CTC (version 2.0) Grade in Table 2. The most common adverse reactions in pancreatic cancer patients receiving TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine were fatigue, rash, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea. In the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm, Grade 3/4 rash and diarrhea were each reported in 5% of TARCEVA plus gemcitabine-treated patients. The median time to onset of rash and diarrhea was 10 days and 15 days, respectively. Rash and diarrhea each resulted in dose reductions in 2% of patients, and resulted in study discontinuation in up to 1% of patients receiving TARCEVA plus gemcitabine. The 150 mg cohort was associated with a higher rate of certain class-specific adverse reactions including rash and required more frequent dose reduction or interruption.

In comparison, 3 patients in the placebo/gemcitabine group developed deep venous thrombosis (incidence 1.2%). The overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 thrombotic events, including deep venous thrombosis, was similar in the two treatment arms: 11% for TARCEVA plus gemcitabine and 9% for placebo plus gemcitabine. No differences in Grade 3 or Grade 4 hematologic laboratory toxicities were detected between the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine group compared to the placebo plus gemcitabine group. Severe adverse events (>=grade 3 NCI-CTC) in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine group with incidences < 5% included syncope, arrhythmias, ileus, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia, myocardial infarction/ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents including cerebral hemorrhage, and renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Liver function test abnormalities (including elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin) have been observed following the administration of TARCEVA plus gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer. Table 3 displays the most severe NCI-CTC grade of liver function abnormalities that developed. TARCEVA dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if changes in liver function are severe [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. These adverse events were reported as peptic ulcer bleeding (gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers), hematemesis, hematochezia, melena and hemorrhage from possible colitis. Cases of acute renal failure or renal insufficiency, including fatalities, with or without hypokalemia have been reported. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Cases of Grade 1 epistaxis were also reported in both the single-agent NSCLC and the pancreatic cancer clinical trials. NCI-CTC Grade 3 conjunctivitis and keratitis have been reported infrequently in patients receiving TARCEVA therapy in the NSCLC and pancreatic cancer clinical trials. Corneal ulcerations may also occur. [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Hair and nail disorders including alopecia, hirsutism, eyelash/eyebrow changes, paronychia and brittle and loose nails have been reported in clinical trials and during post-marketing use of TARCEVA. In patients who develop skin rash, the appearance of the rash is typically erythematous and maculopapular and it may resemble acne with follicular pustules, but is histopathologically different. This skin reaction commonly occurs on the face, upper chest and back, but may be more generalized or severe (NCI-CTC Grade 3 or 4) with desquamation. Associated symptoms may include itching, tenderness and/or burning. Dry skin with or without digital skin fissures may occur. Hepatic failure has been reported in patients treated with single-agent TARCEVA or TARCEVA combined with chemotherapy in clinical studies and during post-marketing use of TARCEVA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 )]; it is not possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to TARCEVA treatment. In general, no notable differences in the safety of TARCEVA monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine could be discerned between females or males and between patients younger or older than the age of 65 years [s ee Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. The safety of TARCEVA appears similar in Caucasian and Asian patients."

        "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Enter section text here Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)-like events, including fatalities have been infrequently reported. Interrupt TARCEVA if acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough and fever occur. Discontinue TARCEVA if ILD is diagnosed. (5.1) Monitor patients with hepatic impairment closely. Interrupt or discontinue TARCEVA if changes in liver function are severe (5.2) Cases of hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome (including fatalities) have been reported. Monitor periodic liver function testing. Interrupt or discontinue TARCEVA if liver function changes are severe. (5.3) Cases of acute renal failure (including fatalities), and renal insufficiency have been reported. Interrupt TARCEVA in the event of dehydration. Monitor renal function and electrolytes in patients at risk of dehydration. (5.4) Myocardial infarction/ischemia has been reported, including fatalities, in patients with pancreatic cancer. (5.5) Cerebrovascular accidents, including a fatality, have been reported in patients with pancreatic cancer. (5.6) Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia with thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients with pancreatic cancer. (5.7) Women should be advised to avoid pregnancy while on TARCEVA. Treatment should only be continued if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. (5.8) International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations and bleeding events, some associated with concomitant warfarin administration have been reported. Monitor patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants. (5.9) 5.1 Pulmonary Toxicity There have been infrequent reports of serious Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)-like events, including fatalities, in patients receiving TARCEVA for treatment of NSCLC, pancreatic cancer or other advanced solid tumors. In the randomized single-agent NSCLC study [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)], the incidence of ILD-like events (0.8%) was the same in both the placebo and TARCEVA groups. In the pancreatic cancer study - in combination with gemcitabine - [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], the incidence of ILD-like events was 2.5% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine group vs. 0.4% in the placebo plus gemcitabine group. The overall incidence of ILD-like events in approximately 4900 TARCEVA-treated patients from all studies (including uncontrolled studies and studies with concurrent chemotherapy) was approximately 0.7%. Reported diagnoses in patients suspected of having ILD-like events included pneumonitis, radiation pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and lung infiltration. Symptoms started from 5 days to more than 9 months (median 39 days) after initiating TARCEVA therapy. In the lung cancer trials most of the cases were associated with confounding or contributing factors such as concomitant/prior chemotherapy, prior radiotherapy, pre-existing parenchymal lung disease, metastatic lung disease, or pulmonary infections. In the event of an acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, TARCEVA therapy should be interrupted pending diagnostic evaluation. If ILD is diagnosed, TARCEVA should be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 )]. 5.2 Patients with Hepatic Impairment In a pharmacokinetic study in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) associated with significant liver tumor burden, 10 out of 15 patients died on treatment or within 30 days of the last TARCEVA dose. One patient died from hepatorenal syndrome, 1 patient died from rapidly progressing liver failure and the remaining 8 patients died from progressive disease. Six out of the 10 patients who died had baseline total bilirubin > 3 x ULN suggesting severe hepatic impairment. Treatment with TARCEVA should be used with extra caution in patients with total bilirubin > 3 x ULN. Patients with hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > ULN or Child-Pugh A, B and C) should be closely monitored during therapy with TARCEVA. TARCEVA dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if changes in liver function are severe such as doubling of total bilirubin and/or tripling of transaminases in the setting of pretreatment values outside normal range [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.3 )]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Cases of hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome (including fatalities) have been reported during use of TARCEVA, particularly in patients with baseline hepatic impairment. Therefore, periodic liver function testing (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) is recommended. In the setting of worsening liver function tests, dose interruption and/or dose reduction with frequent liver function test monitoring should be considered. TARCEVA dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if total bilirubin is >3 x ULN and/or transaminases are >5 x ULN in the setting of normal pretreatment values [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.3 )]. 5.4 Renal Failure Cases of hepatorenal syndrome, acute renal failure (including fatalities), and renal insufficiency have been reported. Some were secondary to baseline hepatic impairment while others were associated with severe dehydration due to diarrhea, vomiting, and/or anorexia or concurrent chemotherapy use. In the event of dehydration, particularly in patients with contributing risk factors for renal failure (eg, pre-existing renal disease, medical conditions or medications that may lead to renal disease, or other predisposing conditions including advanced age), TARCEVA therapy should be interrupted and appropriate measures should be taken to intensively rehydrate the patient. Periodic monitoring of renal function and serum electrolytes is recommended in patients at risk of dehydration [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.3 )]. 5.5 Myocardial infarction/ischemia In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, six patients (incidence of 2.3%) in the TARCEVA/gemcitabine group developed myocardial infarction/ischemia. One of these patients died due to myocardial infarction. In comparison, 3 patients in the placebo/gemcitabine group developed myocardial infarction (incidence 1.2%) and one died due to myocardial infarction. 5.6 Cerebrovascular accident In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, six patients in the TARCEVA/gemcitabine group developed cerebrovascular accidents (incidence: 2.3%). One of these was hemorrhagic and was the only fatal event. In comparison, in the placebo/gemcitabine group there were no cerebrovascular accidents. 5.7 Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia with Thrombocytopenia In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, two patients in the TARCEVA/gemcitabine group developed microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia (incidence: 0.8%). Both patients received TARCEVA and gemcitabine concurrently. In comparison, in the placebo/gemcitabine group there were no cases of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia. 5.8 Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with TARCEVA. Erlotinib administered to rabbits during organogenesis at doses that result in plasma drug concentrations of approximately 3 times those in humans (AUCs at 150 mg daily dose) was associated with embryo/fetal lethality and abortion. When erlotinib was administered to female rats prior to mating and through the first week of pregnancy, at doses 0.3 or 0.7 times the clinical dose of 150 mg, on a mg/m2 basis, there was an increase in early resorptions that resulted in a decrease in the number of live fetuses. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.9 Elevated International Normalized Ratio and Potential Bleeding International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations and infrequent reports of bleeding events including gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal bleedings have been reported in clinical studies, some associated with concomitant warfarin administration. Patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time or INR. [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]."

When TARCEVA was co-administered with ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, the erlotinib exposure [AUC] and maximum concentration [Cmax] increased by 39% and 17%, respectively. Dose modifications are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. CYP3A4 Inducers Pre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin for 7-11 days prior to TARCEVA decreased erlotinib AUC by 58% to 80%. Dose modifications are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Drugs Affecting Gastric pH Co-administration of TARCEVA with omeprazole decreased erlotinib AUC by 46% and co-administration of TARCEVA with ranitidine 300 mg decreased erlotinib AUC by 33%. When TARCEVA was administered with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily (at least 10 h after the previous ranitidine evening dose and 2 h before the ranitidine morning dose), erlotinib AUC decreased by 15%. Increasing the dose of TARCEVA when co-administered with such agents is not likely to compensate for the loss of exposure. Scheduling modifications are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cigarette Smoking Cigarette smoking results in reductions in erlotinib AUC. Dose modifications are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Anticoagulants Interaction with coumarin-derived anticoagulants, including warfarin, leading to increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) and bleeding adverse reactions, which in some cases were fatal, have been reported in patients receiving TARCEVA.

Safety evaluation of TARCEVA is based on more than 1200 cancer patients who received TARCEVA as monotherapy, more than 300 patients who received TARCEVA 100 or 150 mg plus gemcitabine, and 1228 patients who received TARCEVA concurrently with other chemotherapies. The most common adverse reactions with TARCEVA are rash and diarrhea usually with onset during the first month of treatment. The incidences of rash and diarrhea from clinical studies of TARCEVA for the treatment of NSCLC and pancreatic cancer were 70% for rash and 42% for diarrhea. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer First-Line Treatment of Patients with EGFR Mutations The most frequent (>= 30%) adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were diarrhea, asthenia, rash, cough, dyspnea and decreased appetite. In TARCEVA-treated patients the median time to onset of rash was 15 days and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 32 days. The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were rash and diarrhea. Dose interruptions or reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 37% of TARCEVA-treated patients, and 14.3% of TARCEVA-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In TARCEVA-treated patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions leading to dose modification were rash (13%), diarrhea (10%), and asthenia (3.6%). Selected, common adverse reactions in Study 4, occurring in at least 10% of patients who received TARCEVA or chemotherapy and an increase in >= 5% in the TARCEVA treated group, are summarized by NCI-CTC (version 3.0) Grade in Table 1.

Grade 3 (> 5.0 - 20.0 x ULN) elevations were not observed in TARCEVA-treated patients. TARCEVA dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if changes in liver function are severe [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Pancreatic Cancer - TARCEVA Administered Concurrently with Gemcitabine This was a randomized, double blind placebo-controlled study of TARCEVA (150 mg or 100 mg daily) or placebo plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 IV) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer (Study 2). The safety population comprised 282 patients in the erlotinib group (259 in the 100 mg cohort and 23 in the 150 mg cohort) and 280 patients in the placebo group (256 in the 100 mg cohort and 24 in the 150 mg cohort). Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine in the randomized trial of patients with pancreatic cancer (Study 2) are summarized by NCI-CTC (version 2.0) Grade in Table 4. The most common adverse reactions in pancreatic cancer patients receiving TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine were fatigue, rash, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea. In the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm, Grade 3-4 rash and diarrhea were each reported in 5% of patients. The median time to onset of rash and diarrhea was 10 days and 15 days, respectively. Rash and diarrhea each resulted in dose reductions in 2% of patients, and resulted in study discontinuation in up to 1% of patients receiving TARCEVA plus gemcitabine. Severe adverse reactions (>= Grade 3 NCI-CTC) in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine group with incidences < 5% included syncope, arrhythmias, ileus, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia, myocardial infarction/ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents including cerebral hemorrhage, and renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The 150 mg cohort was associated with a higher rate of certain class-specific adverse reactions including rash and required more frequent dose reduction or interruption.

These adverse reactions were reported as peptic ulcer bleeding (gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers), hematemesis, hematochezia, melena and hemorrhage from possible colitis. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of TARCEVA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, in combination with statin therapy Eye Disorders: ocular inflammation including uveitis"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): Occurs in 1.1% of patients. Withhold TARCEVA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough and fever. Discontinue TARCEVA if ILD is diagnosed. (5.1) -Renal Failure: Monitor renal function and electrolytes, particularly in patients at risk of dehydration. Withhold TARCEVA for severe renal toxicity. (5.2) -Hepatotoxicity with or without hepatic impairment including hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome: Monitor periodic liver testing. Withhold or discontinue TARCEVA for severe or worsening liver tests. (5.3) -Gastrointestinal perforations: Discontinue TARCEVA. (5.4) -Bullous and exfoliative skin disorders: Discontinue TARCEVA. (5.5) -Myocardial infarction (MI)/ischemia: The risk of MI is increased in patients with pancreatic cancer. (5.6) -Cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The risk of CVA is increased in patients with pancreatic cancer. (5.7) -Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA): The risk of MAHA is increased in patients with pancreatic cancer. (5.8) -Ocular disorders: Discontinue TARCEVA for corneal perforation, ulceration or persistent severe keratitis. (5.9) -Hemorrhage in patients taking warfarin: Regularly monitor INR in patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants. (5.10) -Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus and to use highly effective contraception (5.11, 8.6) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Cases of serious ILD, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment. The overall incidence of ILD in approximately 32,000 TARCEVA-treated patients in uncontrolled studies and studies with concurrent chemotherapy was approximately 1.1%. In patients with ILD, the onset of symptoms was between 5 days to more than 9 months (median 39 days) after initiating TARCEVA therapy. Withhold TARCEVA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If ILD is confirmed, permanently discontinue TARCEVA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.2 Renal Failure Hepatorenal syndrome, severe acute renal failure including fatal cases, and renal insufficiency can occur with TARCEVA treatment. Renal failure may arise from exacerbation of underlying baseline hepatic impairment or severe dehydration. The pooled incidence of severe renal impairment in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.5% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.8% in the control arms. The incidence of renal impairment in the pancreatic cancer study was 1.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm. Withhold TARCEVA in patients developing severe renal impairment until renal toxicity is resolved. Perform periodic monitoring of renal function and serum electrolytes during TARCEVA treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity with or without Hepatic Impairment Hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment in patients with normal hepatic function; the risk of hepatic toxicity is increased in patients with baseline hepatic impairment. In clinical studies where patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment were excluded, the pooled incidence of hepatic failure in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.4% in the TARCEVA arms and 0% in the control arms. The incidence of hepatic failure in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm. In a pharmacokinetic study in 15 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) associated with significant liver tumor burden, 10 of these 15 patients died within 30 days of the last TARCEVA dose. One patient died from hepatorenal syndrome, 1 patient died from rapidly progressing liver failure and the remaining 8 patients died from progressive disease. Six out of the 10 patients who died had baseline total bilirubin > 3 x ULN. Perform periodic liver testing (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) during treatment with TARCEVA. Increased frequency of monitoring of liver function is required for patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction. Withhold TARCEVA in patients without pre-existing hepatic impairment for total bilirubin levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal or transaminases greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal. Withhold TARCEVA in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction for doubling of bilirubin or tripling of transaminases values over baseline. Discontinue TARCEVA in patients whose abnormal liver tests meeting the above criteria do not improve significantly or resolve within three weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Gastrointestinal Perforation Gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment. Patients receiving concomitant anti-angiogenic agents, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, or taxane-based chemotherapy, or who have prior history of peptic ulceration or diverticular disease may be at increased risk of perforation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. The pooled incidence of gastrointestinal perforation in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.2% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.1% in the control arms. The incidence of gastrointestinal perforation in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. Permanently discontinue TARCEVA in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.5 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis, which in some cases were fatal, can occur with TARCEVA treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. The pooled incidence of bullous and exfoliative skin disorders in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 1.2% in the TARCEVA arms and 0% in the control arms. The incidence of bullous and exfoliative skin disorders in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. Discontinue TARCEVA treatment if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating conditions [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.6 Myocardial Infarction/Ischemia In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, six patients (incidence of 2.1%) in the TARCEVA/gemcitabine group developed myocardial infarction/ischemia. One of these patients died due to myocardial infarction. In comparison, 3 patients in the placebo/gemcitabine group developed myocardial infarction (incidence 1.1%), and one died due to myocardial infarction. The pooled incidence of myocardial infarction/ischemia in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.2% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.4% in the control arms. 5.7 Cerebrovascular Accident In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, seven patients in the TARCEVA/gemcitabine group developed cerebrovascular accidents (incidence: 2.5%). One of these was hemorrhagic and was the only fatal event. In comparison, in the placebo/gemcitabine group there were no cerebrovascular accidents. The pooled incidence of cerebrovascular accident in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.6% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.9% in the control arms. 5.8 Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia with Thrombocytopenia The pooled incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.1% in the control arms. The incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the pancreatic cancer study was 1.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. 5.9 Ocular Disorders Decreased tear production, abnormal eyelash growth, keratoconjunctivitis sicca or keratitis can occur with TARCEVA treatment and can lead to corneal perforation or ulceration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2)]. The pooled incidence of ocular disorders in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 17.8% in the TARCEVA arms and 4% in the control arms. The incidence of ocular disorders in the pancreatic cancer study was 12.8% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 11.4% in the control arm. Interrupt or discontinue TARCEVA therapy if patients present with acute or worsening ocular disorders such as eye pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Hemorrhage in Patients Taking Warfarin Severe and fatal hemorrhage associated with International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations can occur when TARCEVA and warfarin are administered concurrently. Regularly monitor prothrombin time and INR during TARCEVA treatment in patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, TARCEVA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. When given during organogenesis, erlotinib administration resulted in embryo-fetal lethality and abortion in rabbits at doses approximately 3 times the recommended human daily dose of 150 mg. If TARCEVA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy, and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of TARCEVA. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking TARCEVA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.6)]."

        "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 Inhibitors Erlotinib is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4. Co-treatment with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increased erlotinib AUC by 67%. When TARCEVA was co-administered with ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2, the erlotinib exposure [AUC] and maximum concentration [Cmax] increased by 39% and 17%, respectively. Dose modifications are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. CYP3A4 Inducers Pre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin for 7-11 days prior to TARCEVA decreased erlotinib AUC by 58% to 80%. Dose modifications are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Drugs Affecting Gastric pH Co-administration of TARCEVA with omeprazole decreased erlotinib AUC by 46% and co-administration of TARCEVA with ranitidine 300 mg decreased erlotinib AUC by 33%. When TARCEVA was administered with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily (at least 10 h after the previous ranitidine evening dose and 2 h before the ranitidine morning dose), erlotinib AUC decreased by 15%. Increasing the dose of TARCEVA when co-administered with such agents is not likely to compensate for the loss of exposure. Scheduling modifications are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cigarette Smoking Cigarette smoking results in reductions in erlotinib AUC. Dose modifications are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Anticoagulants Interaction with coumarin-derived anticoagulants, including warfarin, leading to increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) and bleeding adverse reactions, which in some cases were fatal, have been reported in patients receiving TARCEVA. Regularly monitor prothrombin time or INR in patients taking coumarin-derived anticoagulants. Dose modifications of TARCEVA are not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. -CYP3A4 inhibitors increase erlotinib plasma concentrations. (7) -CYP3A4 inducers decrease erlotinib plasma concentrations. (7) -Drugs affecting gastric pH decrease erlotinib plasma concentrations. (7) -Cigarette smoking decreases erlotinib plasma concentrations. (7)"

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact OSI Pharmaceuticals, LLC, at 1-800-572-1932 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Safety evaluation of TARCEVA is based on more than 1200 cancer patients who received TARCEVA as monotherapy, more than 300 patients who received TARCEVA 100 or 150 mg plus gemcitabine, and 1228 patients who received TARCEVA concurrently with other chemotherapies. The most common adverse reactions with TARCEVA are rash and diarrhea usually with onset during the first month of treatment. The incidences of rash and diarrhea from clinical studies of TARCEVA for the treatment of NSCLC and pancreatic cancer were 70% for rash and 42% for diarrhea. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer First-Line Treatment of Patients with EGFR Mutations The most frequent (>= 30%) adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were diarrhea, asthenia, rash, cough, dyspnea and decreased appetite. In TARCEVA-treated patients the median time to onset of rash was 15 days and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 32 days. The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions in TARCEVA-treated patients were rash and diarrhea. Dose interruptions or reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 37% of TARCEVA-treated patients, and 14.3% of TARCEVA-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In TARCEVA-treated patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions leading to dose modification were rash (13%), diarrhea (10%), and asthenia (3.6%). Selected, common adverse reactions in Study 4, occurring in at least 10% of patients who received TARCEVA or chemotherapy and an increase in >= 5% in the TARCEVA treated group, are summarized by NCI-CTC (version 3.0) Grade in Table 1.

Grade 3 (> 5.0 - 20.0 x ULN) elevations were not observed in TARCEVA-treated patients. TARCEVA dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if changes in liver function are severe [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Pancreatic Cancer - TARCEVA Administered Concurrently with Gemcitabine This was a randomized, double blind placebo-controlled study of TARCEVA (150 mg or 100 mg daily) or placebo plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 IV) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer (Study 2). The safety population comprised 282 patients in the erlotinib group (259 in the 100 mg cohort and 23 in the 150 mg cohort) and 280 patients in the placebo group (256 in the 100 mg cohort and 24 in the 150 mg cohort). Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine in the randomized trial of patients with pancreatic cancer (Study 2) are summarized by NCI-CTC (version 2.0) Grade in Table 4. The most common adverse reactions in pancreatic cancer patients receiving TARCEVA 100 mg plus gemcitabine were fatigue, rash, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea. In the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm, Grade 3-4 rash and diarrhea were each reported in 5% of patients. The median time to onset of rash and diarrhea was 10 days and 15 days, respectively. Rash and diarrhea each resulted in dose reductions in 2% of patients, and resulted in study discontinuation in up to 1% of patients receiving TARCEVA plus gemcitabine. Severe adverse reactions (>= Grade 3 NCI-CTC) in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine group with incidences < 5% included syncope, arrhythmias, ileus, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia, myocardial infarction/ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents including cerebral hemorrhage, and renal insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. The 150 mg cohort was associated with a higher rate of certain class-specific adverse reactions including rash and required more frequent dose reduction or interruption.

These adverse reactions were reported as peptic ulcer bleeding (gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers), hematemesis, hematochezia, melena and hemorrhage from possible colitis. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of TARCEVA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, in combination with statin therapy Eye Disorders: ocular inflammation including uveitis"

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS -Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): Occurs in 1.1% of patients. Withhold TARCEVA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough and fever. Discontinue TARCEVA if ILD is diagnosed. (5.1) -Renal Failure: Monitor renal function and electrolytes, particularly in patients at risk of dehydration. Withhold TARCEVA for severe renal toxicity. (5.2) -Hepatotoxicity with or without hepatic impairment including hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome: Monitor periodic liver testing. Withhold or discontinue TARCEVA for severe or worsening liver tests. (5.3) -Gastrointestinal perforations: Discontinue TARCEVA. (5.4) -Bullous and exfoliative skin disorders: Discontinue TARCEVA. (5.5) -Myocardial infarction (MI)/ischemia: The risk of MI is increased in patients with pancreatic cancer. (5.6) -Cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The risk of CVA is increased in patients with pancreatic cancer. (5.7) -Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA): The risk of MAHA is increased in patients with pancreatic cancer. (5.8) -Ocular disorders: Discontinue TARCEVA for corneal perforation, ulceration or persistent severe keratitis. (5.9) -Hemorrhage in patients taking warfarin: Regularly monitor INR in patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants. (5.10) -Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus and to use highly effective contraception (5.11, 8.6) 5.1 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) Cases of serious ILD, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment. The overall incidence of ILD in approximately 32,000 TARCEVA-treated patients in uncontrolled studies and studies with concurrent chemotherapy was approximately 1.1%. In patients with ILD, the onset of symptoms was between 5 days to more than 9 months (median 39 days) after initiating TARCEVA therapy. Withhold TARCEVA for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If ILD is confirmed, permanently discontinue TARCEVA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.2 Renal Failure Hepatorenal syndrome, severe acute renal failure including fatal cases, and renal insufficiency can occur with TARCEVA treatment. Renal failure may arise from exacerbation of underlying baseline hepatic impairment or severe dehydration. The pooled incidence of severe renal impairment in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.5% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.8% in the control arms. The incidence of renal impairment in the pancreatic cancer study was 1.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm. Withhold TARCEVA in patients developing severe renal impairment until renal toxicity is resolved. Perform periodic monitoring of renal function and serum electrolytes during TARCEVA treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity with or without Hepatic Impairment Hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment in patients with normal hepatic function; the risk of hepatic toxicity is increased in patients with baseline hepatic impairment. In clinical studies where patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment were excluded, the pooled incidence of hepatic failure in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.4% in the TARCEVA arms and 0% in the control arms. The incidence of hepatic failure in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm. In a pharmacokinetic study in 15 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) associated with significant liver tumor burden, 10 of these 15 patients died within 30 days of the last TARCEVA dose. One patient died from hepatorenal syndrome, 1 patient died from rapidly progressing liver failure and the remaining 8 patients died from progressive disease. Six out of the 10 patients who died had baseline total bilirubin > 3 x ULN. Perform periodic liver testing (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) during treatment with TARCEVA. Increased frequency of monitoring of liver function is required for patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction. Withhold TARCEVA in patients without pre-existing hepatic impairment for total bilirubin levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal or transaminases greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal. Withhold TARCEVA in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction for doubling of bilirubin or tripling of transaminases values over baseline. Discontinue TARCEVA in patients whose abnormal liver tests meeting the above criteria do not improve significantly or resolve within three weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.4 Gastrointestinal Perforation Gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal cases, can occur with TARCEVA treatment. Patients receiving concomitant anti-angiogenic agents, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, or taxane-based chemotherapy, or who have prior history of peptic ulceration or diverticular disease may be at increased risk of perforation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. The pooled incidence of gastrointestinal perforation in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.2% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.1% in the control arms. The incidence of gastrointestinal perforation in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. Permanently discontinue TARCEVA in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.5 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis, which in some cases were fatal, can occur with TARCEVA treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. The pooled incidence of bullous and exfoliative skin disorders in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 1.2% in the TARCEVA arms and 0% in the control arms. The incidence of bullous and exfoliative skin disorders in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. Discontinue TARCEVA treatment if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating conditions [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.6 Myocardial Infarction/Ischemia In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, six patients (incidence of 2.1%) in the TARCEVA/gemcitabine group developed myocardial infarction/ischemia. One of these patients died due to myocardial infarction. In comparison, 3 patients in the placebo/gemcitabine group developed myocardial infarction (incidence 1.1%), and one died due to myocardial infarction. The pooled incidence of myocardial infarction/ischemia in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.2% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.4% in the control arms. 5.7 Cerebrovascular Accident In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, seven patients in the TARCEVA/gemcitabine group developed cerebrovascular accidents (incidence: 2.5%). One of these was hemorrhagic and was the only fatal event. In comparison, in the placebo/gemcitabine group there were no cerebrovascular accidents. The pooled incidence of cerebrovascular accident in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.6% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.9% in the control arms. 5.8 Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia with Thrombocytopenia The pooled incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0% in the TARCEVA arms and 0.1% in the control arms. The incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the pancreatic cancer study was 1.4% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. 5.9 Ocular Disorders Decreased tear production, abnormal eyelash growth, keratoconjunctivitis sicca or keratitis can occur with TARCEVA treatment and can lead to corneal perforation or ulceration [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2)]. The pooled incidence of ocular disorders in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 17.8% in the TARCEVA arms and 4% in the control arms. The incidence of ocular disorders in the pancreatic cancer study was 12.8% in the TARCEVA plus gemcitabine arm and 11.4% in the control arm. Interrupt or discontinue TARCEVA therapy if patients present with acute or worsening ocular disorders such as eye pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.10 Hemorrhage in Patients Taking Warfarin Severe and fatal hemorrhage associated with International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations can occur when TARCEVA and warfarin are administered concurrently. Regularly monitor prothrombin time and INR during TARCEVA treatment in patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, TARCEVA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. When given during organogenesis, erlotinib administration resulted in embryo-fetal lethality and abortion in rabbits at doses approximately 3 times the recommended human daily dose of 150 mg. If TARCEVA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy, and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of TARCEVA. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking TARCEVA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.6)]."
