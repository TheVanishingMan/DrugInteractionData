        "Drug Interactions In vitro drug metabolism studies indicate that Starlix is predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2C9 (70%) and to a lesser extent CYP3A4 (30%). Starlix is a potential inhibitor of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme in vivo as indicated by its ability to inhibit the in vitro metabolism of tolbutamide. Inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolic reactions was not detected in in vitro experiments. Glyburide: In a randomized, multiple-dose crossover study, patients with Type 2 diabetes were administered 120 mg Starlix three times a day before meals for 1 day in combination with glyburide 10 mg daily. There were no clinically relevant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of either agent. Metformin: When Starlix 120 mg three times daily before meals was administered in combination with metformin 500 mg three times daily to patients with Type 2 diabetes, there were no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either agent. Digoxin: When Starlix 120 mg before meals was administered in combination with a single 1-mg dose of digoxin to healthy volunteers, there were no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either agent. Warfarin: When healthy subjects were administered Starlix 120 mg three times daily before meals for four days in combination with a single dose of warfarin 30 mg on day 2, there were no alterations in the pharmacokinetics of either agent. Prothrombin time was not affected. Diclofenac: Administration of morning and lunch doses of Starlix 120 mg in combination with a single 75-mg dose of diclofenac in healthy volunteers resulted in no significant changes to the pharmacokinetics of either agent.",

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In clinical trials, approximately 2,600 patients with Type 2 diabetes were treated with Starlix(R) (nateglinide). Of these, approximately 1,335 patients were treated for 6 months or longer and approximately 190 patients for one year or longer. Hypoglycemia was relatively uncommon in all treatment arms of the clinical trials. Only 0.3% of Starlix patients discontinued due to hypoglycemia. Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia have been observed after administration of nateglinide. These symptoms included sweating, trembling, dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, nausea, fatigue, and weakness. Gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea and nausea, were no more common in patients using the combination of Starlix and metformin than in patients receiving metformin alone. Likewise, peripheral edema was no more common in patients using the combination of Starlix and rosiglitazone than in patients receiving rosiglitazone alone.

        "Drug Interactions Nateglinide is highly bound to plasma proteins (98%), mainly albumin. In vitro displacement studies with highly protein-bound drugs such as furosemide, propranolol, captopril, nicardipine, pravastatin, glyburide, warfarin, phenytoin, acetylsalicylic acid, tolbutamide, and metformin showed no influence on the extent of nateglinide protein binding. Similarly, nateglinide had no influence on the serum protein binding of propranolol, glyburide, nicardipine, warfarin, phenytoin, acetylsalicylic acid, and tolbutamide in vitro. However, prudent evaluation of individual cases is warranted in the clinical setting. Certain drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), salicylates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and non-selective beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, guanethidine, and CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, amiodarone, miconazole, oxandrolone) may potentiate the hypoglycemic action of nateglinide and other oral antidiabetic drugs. Certain drugs including thiazides, corticosteroids, thyroid products, and sympathomimetics, somatropin, rifampin, phenytoin and dietary supplements (St John's wort) may reduce the hypoglycemic action of nateglinide and other oral antidiabetic drugs. Somatostatin analogues may potentiate or attenuate the hypoglycemic action of nateglinide. When these drugs are administered to or withdrawn from patients receiving nateglinide, the patient should be observed closely for changes in glycemic control."

        "Drug Interactions Nateglinide is highly bound to plasma proteins (98%), mainly albumin. In-vitro displacement studies with highly protein-bound drugs such as furosemide, propranolol, captopril, nicardipine, pravastatin, glyburide, warfarin, phenytoin, acetylsalicylic acid, tolbutamide, and metformin showed no influence on the extent of nateglinide protein binding. Similarly, nateglinide had no influence on the serum protein binding of propranolol, glyburide, nicardipine, warfarin, phenytoin, acetylsalicylic acid and tolbutamide in-vitro. However, prudent evaluation of individual cases is warranted in the clinical setting. Certain drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), salicylates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and non-selective beta-adrenergic-blocking agents may potentiate the hypoglycemic action of nateglinide and other oral antidiabetic drugs. Certain drugs including thiazides, corticosteroids, thyroid products, sympathomimetics, somatropin, rifampin, phenytoin and dietary supplements (St. John's wort) may reduce the hypoglycemic action of nateglinide and other oral antidiabetic drugs. Somatostatin analogues may potentiate or attenuate the hypoglycemic action of nateglinide. When these drugs are administered to or withdrawn from patients receiving nateglinide, the patient should be observed closely for changes in glycemic control."

        "ADVERSE REACTIONS In clinical trials, approximately 2,600 patients with Type 2 diabetes were treated with nateglinide. Of these, approximately 1,335 patients were treated for 6 months or longer and approximately 190 patients for one year or longer. Hypoglycemia was relatively uncommon in all treatment arms of the clinical trials. Only 0.3% of nateglinide patients discontinued due to hypoglycemia. Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia have been observed after administration of nateglinide. These symptoms included sweating, trembling, dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, nausea, fatigue and weakness. Gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea and nausea, were no more common in patients using the combination of nateglinide and metformin than in patients receiving metformin alone. Likewise, peripheral edema was no more common in patients using the combination of nateglinide and rosiglitazone than in patients receiving rosiglitazone alone. The following table lists events that occurred more frequently in nateglinide patients than placebo patients in controlled clinical trials. Common Adverse Events (>=2% in nateglinide patients) in Nateglinide Monotherapy Trials (% of patients) Preferred Term PlaceboN=458 NateglinideN=1441 Upper Respiratory Infection 8.1 10.5 Back Pain 3.7 4.0 Flu Symptoms 2.6 3.6 Dizziness 2.2 3.6 Arthropathy 2.2 3.3 Diarrhea 3.1 3.2 Accidental Trauma 1.7 2.9 Bronchitis 2.6 2.7 Coughing 2.2 2.4 Hypoglycemia 0.4 2.4 During post-marketing experience, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, itching and urticaria have been reported. Similarly, cases of jaundice, cholestatic hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes have been reported. Laboratory Abnormalities Uric Acid: There were increases in mean uric acid levels for patients treated with nateglinide alone, nateglinide in combination with metformin, metformin alone, and glyburide alone. The respective differences from placebo were 0.29 mg/dL, 0.45 mg/dL, 0.28 mg/dL, and 0.19 mg/dL. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown."
