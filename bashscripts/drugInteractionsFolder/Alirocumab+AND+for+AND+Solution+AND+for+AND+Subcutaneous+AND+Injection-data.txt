        "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed in the other sections of the labeling: Allergic Reactions [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] The most commonly occurring adverse reactions (â‰¥5% of patients treated with PRALUENT and occurring more frequently than with placebo) are nasopharyngitis, injection site reactions, and influenza. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sanofi at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of PRALUENT was evaluated in 9 placebo-controlled trials that included 2476 patients treated with PRALUENT, including 2135 exposed for 6 months and 1999 exposed for more than 1 year (median treatment duration of 65 weeks). The mean age of the population was 59 years, 40% of the population were women, 90% were Caucasians, 4% were Black or African American, and 3% were Asians. At baseline, 37% of patients had a diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and 66% had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of PRALUENT-treated patients, and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Occurring in Greater Than or Equal to 2% of PRALUENT-Treated Patients and More Frequently Than with Placebo Adverse Reactions Placebo (N=1276) PRALUENT75 mg every 2 weeks and 150 mg every 2 weeks combined (N=2476) Nasopharyngitis 11.1% 11.3% Injection site reactionsincludes erythema/redness, itching, swelling, pain/tenderness 5.1% 7.2% Influenza 4.6% 5.7% Urinary tract infection 4.6% 4.8% Diarrhea 4.4% 4.7% Bronchitis 3.8% 4.3% Myalgia 3.4% 4.2% Muscle spasms 2.4% 3.1% Sinusitis 2.7% 3.0% Cough 2.3% 2.5% Contusion 1.3% 2.1% Musculoskeletal pain 1.6% 2.1% Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5.3% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 5.1% of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in patients treated with PRALUENT were allergic reactions (0.6% versus 0.2% for PRALUENT and placebo, respectively) and elevated liver enzymes (0.3% versus <0.1%). Local Injection Site Reactions Local injection site reactions including erythema/redness, itching, swelling, and pain/tenderness were reported more frequently in patients treated with PRALUENT (7.2% versus 5.1% for PRALUENT and placebo, respectively). Few patients discontinued treatment because of these reactions (0.2% versus 0.4% for PRALUENT and placebo, respectively), but patients receiving PRALUENT had a greater number of injection site reactions, had more reports of associated symptoms, and had reactions of longer average duration than patients receiving placebo. Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions were reported more frequently in patients treated with PRALUENT than in those treated with placebo (8.6% versus 7.8%). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to allergic reactions was higher among those treated with PRALUENT (0.6% versus 0.2% ). Serious allergic reactions, such as hypersensitivity, nummular eczema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis were reported in patients using PRALUENT in controlled clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Neurocognitive Events Neurocognitive events were reported in 0.8% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 0.7% of patients treated with placebo. Confusion or memory impairment were reported more frequently by those treated with PRALUENT (0.2% for each) than in those treated with placebo (<0.1% for each). Liver Enzyme Abnormalities Liver-related disorders (primarily related to abnormalities in liver enzymes) were reported in 2.5% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, leading to treatment discontinuation in 0.4% and 0.2% of patients, respectively. Increases in serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 1.4% of patients treated with placebo. Low LDL-C Values In a pool of both placebo- and active-controlled clinical trials, 796 PRALUENT-treated patients had two consecutive calculated LDL-C values <25 mg/dL, and 288 had two consecutive calculated LDL-C values <15 mg/dL. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy (e.g., maximally tolerated statins) were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and PRALUENT dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis. Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of LDL-C induced by PRALUENT are unknown. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with PRALUENT. In a pool of ten placebo- and active-controlled trials, 4.8% of patients treated with PRALUENT had anti-drug antibodies (ADA) newly detected after initiating treatment as compared with 0.6% of patients treated with control. Patients who developed ADA had a higher incidence of injection site reactions compared with patients who did not develop ADA (10.2% vs 5.9%). A total of 1.2% of patients treated with PRALUENT developed neutralizing antibodies (NAb) on at least one occasion as compared with no patients treated with control, and 0.3% of patients both tested positive for NAb and exhibited transient or prolonged loss of efficacy. The long-term consequences of continuing PRALUENT treatment in the presence of persistent NAb are unknown. Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay as well as other factors. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to PRALUENT with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Allergic Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria), including some serious events (e.g., hypersensitivity vasculitis and hypersensitivity reactions requiring hospitalization), have been reported with PRALUENT treatment. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with PRALUENT, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. (5.1) 5.1 Allergic Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria), including some serious events (e.g., hypersensitivity vasculitis and hypersensitivity reactions requiring hospitalization), have been reported with PRALUENT treatment. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with PRALUENT, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4) ]."
